Located in Southern California, it serves as the cultural, financial, and commercial center of the region. Known for its Mediterranean climate, ethnic diversity, and sprawling urban landscape, Los Angeles is a global hub for entertainment, particularly as the epicenter of the Hollywood film industry. The city spans over 469 square miles, making it one of the most geographically expansive urban areas in the country [City of Los Angeles](https://www.lacity.org/about-los-angeles).\n\nLos Angeles is also a major gateway for international trade, with the Port of Los Angeles being one of the busiest in the Western Hemisphere. Its diverse economy includes sectors like technology, fashion, aerospace, and tourism, drawing millions of visitors annually to landmarks such as the Hollywood Sign, Disneyland (nearby in Anaheim), and Venice Beach.\n\n## Historical Background\n\nThe area that is now Los Angeles was originally inhabited by the Tongva and Chumash Native American tribes for thousands of years before European contact. The first recorded European exploration occurred in 1542 when Portuguese explorer Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo claimed the region for Spain [Los Angeles Almanac](http://www.laalmanac.com/history/hi01a.php). However, it wasn’t until 1769 that Spanish settlers established a presence under the leadership of Gaspar de Portolá, as part of the broader colonization efforts in Alta California.\n\nOn September 4, 1781, Los Angeles was officially founded as *El Pueblo de Nuestra Señora la Reina de los Ángeles* (The Town of Our Lady the Queen of the Angels) by a group of 44 settlers under Spanish Governor Felipe de Neve. It remained a small agricultural community under Spanish and later Mexican rule until the mid-19th century [History.com](https://www.history.com/topics/us-states/los-angeles-california). After the Mexican-American War, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848 ceded California to the United States, and Los Angeles was incorporated as a city on April 4, 1850, just months before California achieved statehood.\n\nThe late 19th and early 20th centuries saw rapid growth due to the arrival of the Southern Pacific Railroad in 1876 and the discovery of oil in the 1890s. The development of the film industry in the early 1900s, driven by favorable weather and diverse landscapes, cemented Los Angeles as the heart of Hollywood [Hollywood Chamber of Commerce](https://hollywoodchamber.net/history/). The city also faced challenges, including racial tensions, as seen in the 1965 Watts Riots and the 1992 Los Angeles Riots following the Rodney King verdict [Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/place/Los-Angeles-California/History).\n\n## Current Status and Relevance\n\nToday, Los Angeles is a global metropolis with significant cultural and economic influence. It serves as the seat of Los Angeles County, which has a population of over 10 million, making it the most populous county in the United States [Los Angeles County](https://lacounty.gov/). The city’s economy is diverse, with major contributions from entertainment, international trade, technology (often dubbed \"Silicon Beach\"), and manufacturing. The Port of Los Angeles, combined with the Port of Long Beach, forms the largest port complex in the U.S., handling a significant portion of the nation’s imports and exports [Port of Los Angeles](https://www.portoflosangeles.org/).\n\nLos Angeles is also a center for higher education, home to prestigious institutions like the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and the University of Southern California (USC). Its cultural landscape is enriched by world-class museums such as the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) and the Getty Center. However, the city faces ongoing challenges, including homelessness, traffic congestion, and housing affordability crises, which have been widely reported and debated [Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-01-12/los-angeles-homeless-count-2023).\n\nPolitically, Los Angeles is a Democratic stronghold, reflecting California’s progressive leanings.
