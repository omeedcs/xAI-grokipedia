## Introduction
Rome, often referred to as the "Eternal City," is the capital of Italy and one of the most historically significant cities in the world. Located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, along the shores of the Tiber River, Rome is a city steeped in over 2,700 years of history. It serves as the political, cultural, and religious center of Italy and is home to iconic landmarks such as the Colosseum, the Roman Forum, and the Vatican City, an independent city-state enclaved within Rome. As the heart of the ancient Roman Empire, Rome played a pivotal role in shaping Western civilization through its contributions to law, government, architecture, and language [History of Rome](https://www.britannica.com/place/Rome).

## Historical Background
Rome's history is traditionally dated to 753 BCE, when, according to legend, it was founded by Romulus on the Palatine Hill. This mythological origin story, while not historically verified, reflects the city's deep cultural roots. Over centuries, Rome evolved from a small village into the capital of one of the largest empires in history.

- **Monarchy and Republic (753–27 BCE):** Initially ruled by kings, Rome transitioned into a republic around 509 BCE, establishing a system of elected officials and a Senate. During this period, Rome expanded its influence across the Italian Peninsula and beyond, engaging in conflicts such as the Punic Wars against Carthage [Roman Republic](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/roman-republic).
- **Roman Empire (27 BCE–476 CE in the West):** Under Augustus, Rome became an empire in 27 BCE, marking the beginning of a period of relative peace known as the Pax Romana. The empire reached its territorial peak under Emperor Trajan in the 2nd century CE, stretching from Britain to North Africa and the Middle East. However, internal strife, economic challenges, and invasions led to the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 CE [Fall of Rome](https://www.history.com/topics/ancient-rome/ancient-rome).
- **Medieval and Renaissance Periods:** After the fall of the Western Empire, Rome became a center of Christianity under the influence of the Catholic Church. The city experienced a cultural and artistic revival during the Renaissance (14th–17th centuries), with figures like Michelangelo and Raphael contributing to landmarks such as St. Peter’s Basilica [Renaissance in Rome](https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2017/michelangelo-divine-draftsman-and-designer).
- **Modern History:** Rome played a central role in the unification of Italy in 1871, becoming the capital of the newly formed Kingdom of Italy. During the 20th century, it witnessed the rise and fall of Fascism under Benito Mussolini and emerged as a democratic capital after World War II [Modern Italy](https://www.britannica.com/place/Italy/History).
