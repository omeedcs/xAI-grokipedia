Today, Budapest is renowned for its thermal baths, grand bridges, and UNESCO World Heritage Sites, attracting millions of tourists annually.

## Historical Background

Budapest's history spans over two millennia, with its origins tracing back to the Roman Empire. The area was first settled by the Celts before becoming the Roman province of Pannonia around the 1st century AD. The Romans established a military camp called Aquincum, the remnants of which can still be seen today in the Óbuda district [Aquincum Museum](https://www.aquincum.hu/en/).

- **Medieval Era**: After the fall of the Roman Empire, the region was inhabited by various tribes until the arrival of the Magyars in the 9th century, who founded the Kingdom of Hungary. Buda emerged as a significant royal seat in the 13th century under King Béla IV, who built a castle to protect against Mongol invasions [Buda Castle History](https://budacastlebudapest.com/history/).
- **Ottoman and Habsburg Rule**: In the 16th century, Buda fell under Ottoman control for 150 years following the Battle of Mohács in 1526. It was later recaptured by the Habsburgs in 1686, marking the beginning of Austrian influence. During this period, Pest developed as a commercial hub on the eastern bank of the Danube [Ottoman Hungary](https://www.britannica.com/place/Hungary/Ottoman-expansion).
- **Unification and Modern Era**: The unification of Buda, Pest, and Óbuda in 1873 marked the birth of modern Budapest. The late 19th and early 20th centuries saw rapid growth, with the construction of iconic landmarks like the Hungarian Parliament Building and the Chain Bridge. Budapest played a central role in the Austro-Hungarian Empire until its dissolution after World War I [Budapest History](https://www.britannica.com/place/Budapest).
- **20th Century Challenges**: The city endured significant destruction during World War II, with much of its infrastructure damaged during the Siege of Budapest in 1944-1945. Post-war, under communist rule as part of the Eastern Bloc, Budapest saw periods of repression, notably during the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, a failed uprising against Soviet control [Hungarian Revolution of 1956](https://www.history.com/topics/cold-war/1956-hungarian-revolution).
