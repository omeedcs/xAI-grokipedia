# Golden State Warriors

The Golden State Warriors are a professional basketball franchise competing in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Western Conference's Pacific Division. Founded in 1946 as the Philadelphia Warriors in the Basketball Association of America (BAA), the predecessor to the NBA, the team won its first championship in 1947 before relocating to San Francisco in 1962, where it became the San Francisco Warriors, and adopting the Golden State moniker ahead of the 1971–72 season to represent the entire state of California. The Warriors play their home games at Chase Center in San Francisco and have secured seven league titles overall, establishing themselves as one of the NBA's most successful franchises through distinct eras of dominance.

Early successes included the 1947 BAA title led by Joe Fulks and the 1956 NBA championship featuring Paul Arizin and Neil Johnston, followed by a 1975 victory under Rick Barry that ended an 11-year playoff drought. After decades of inconsistency marked by relocation debates and middling performance, the franchise entered a modern dynasty beginning in 2015, capturing four championships in eight years (2015, 2017, 2018, 2022) powered by Stephen Curry's revolutionary three-point shooting, alongside Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, and briefly Kevin Durant, under coach Steve Kerr. This period featured the NBA's best regular-season record of 73–9 in 2015–16 and multiple individual accolades, including two MVP awards for Curry and a Defensive Player of the Year for Green, though it was tempered by internal tensions and Green's repeated suspensions for on-court altercations rooted in aggressive defensive play. The Warriors' emphasis on pace, spacing, and analytics-driven strategy has influenced league-wide trends, prioritizing empirical efficiency over traditional physicality.

## History

### Origins and Philadelphia era (1946–1962)

The Philadelphia Warriors were established in 1946 by promoter Eddie Gottlieb as a charter member of the Basketball Association of America (BAA), the precursor to the National Basketball Association (NBA), with Gottlieb serving as owner, general manager, and head coach. The franchise drew inspiration from earlier independent teams like the Philadelphia SPHAs, which Gottlieb had previously managed, but entered professional league play amid post-World War II expansion of organized basketball. The Warriors played their inaugural game on November 1, 1946, defeating the Pittsburgh Ironmen 81–75 at the Philadelphia Arena.

In their debut 1946–47 season, the Warriors compiled a 35–25 record, finishing second in the BAA's Eastern Division, and advanced to the playoffs where they upset the top-seeded Washington Capitols before defeating the Chicago Stags 4–1 in the finals to claim the league's first championship. Forward Joe Fulks, a 6-foot-5 sharpshooter from Murray State University, led the league in scoring with 23.2 points per game and earned first-team All-BAA honors, pioneering the jump shot as a primary offensive weapon in the era's rough, low-scoring game dominated by set shots and underhand free throws. Key contributors included forward Howie Dallmar and guard Angelo Musi, with the team's success rooted in Gottlieb's emphasis on disciplined fundamentals and local talent acquisition amid competition from established East Coast rivals.

Following the 1949 BAA-National Basketball League merger that formed the NBA, the Warriors maintained competitiveness in the early 1950s but posted inconsistent records, ranging from 27–42 in 1949–50 to 40–26 in 1951–52, hampered by injuries, roster turnover, and the league's growing parity. Fulks remained a scoring force through 1954, averaging 16.4 points over his eight seasons with the team, but departed after averaging 12.5 points in 1953–54 amid declining efficiency. The franchise introduced forward Paul Arizin in 1950, a Philadelphia native and Villanova product who debuted with 16.7 points per game and became a cornerstone with his mid-range scoring and rebounding.

The Warriors' second title came in the 1955–56 season, finishing 45–27 and defeating the Fort Wayne Pistons 4–1 in the NBA Finals, powered by Arizin's 26.8 points per game in the series and support from guard Guy Rodgers' playmaking. Gottlieb coached until 1955, transitioning to a front-office role as the team navigated rising operational costs and attendance challenges in Philadelphia's competitive sports market. By the early 1960s, persistent financial losses—exacerbated by a 17–58 record in 1961–62—and the lure of untapped West Coast markets prompted Gottlieb to relocate the franchise to San Francisco ahead of the 1962–63 season, rebranding it as the San Francisco Warriors to broaden its appeal.

### Wilt Chamberlain era (1959–1965)

Wilt Chamberlain was selected by the Philadelphia Warriors as a territorial pick in the 1959 NBA draft, third overall. In his rookie 1959–60 season, Chamberlain averaged 37.6 points and 27.0 rebounds per game, leading the league in both categories while powering the Warriors to a 49–26 record and second place in the Eastern Division. He earned NBA Rookie of the Year, Most Valuable Player, and All-Star Game MVP honors that year. The team advanced past the Syracuse Nationals in the division semifinals but fell to the Boston Celtics in the division finals.

The 1960–61 season saw the Warriors finish 46–33, again second in the East, though they were eliminated early by the Nationals. Chamberlain continued his dominance, averaging 38.3 points and 27.2 rebounds per game and topping the league in scoring and rebounding. In 1961–62, under coach Frank McGuire, the Warriors posted a 49–31 record and reached the Eastern Division finals, losing to the Celtics in seven games. Chamberlain set a single-season scoring record with 50.4 points per game alongside 25.7 rebounds, highlighted by his 100-point performance against the New York Knicks on March 2, 1962, in a 169–147 victory played in Hershey, Pennsylvania. That summer, franchise owner Eddie Gottlieb relocated the team to San Francisco, renaming them the San Francisco Warriors ahead of the 1962–63 season.

The move coincided with a downturn, as the Warriors finished 31–49 in 1962–63 without playoff qualification despite Chamberlain's league-leading 44.8 points and 24.3 rebounds per game. Realignment placed them in the Western Division for 1963–64, where they compiled a 48–32 record, defeated the St. Louis Hawks in the division finals 4–3, and advanced to the NBA Finals. Chamberlain led all playoff scorers with 416 points, but the team lost to the Celtics 4–1. He again paced the league in scoring (36.9 points) and rebounding (22.3).

Struggles persisted into 1964–65, with the Warriors at 17–17 when, on January 15, 1965, they traded Chamberlain to the expansion Philadelphia 76ers for centers Connie Dierking and Lee Shaffer, forward Paul Neumann, and cash considerations reportedly under $50,000. The deal stemmed from tensions between Chamberlain and management amid the team's financial pressures and poor performance. Over six seasons with the Warriors, Chamberlain averaged 41.5 points and 25.1 rebounds per game, securing four scoring titles and five rebounding crowns, yet the franchise reached only one Finals without a championship, overshadowed by Boston's dynasty.

### Rick Barry and Nate Thurmond era (1965–1978)

Rick Barry joined the San Francisco Warriors as the second overall pick in the 1965 NBA draft out of the University of Miami, immediately forming a potent duo with center Nate Thurmond, who had been anchoring the team's defense since being selected third overall in 1963. Barry won NBA Rookie of the Year honors in the 1965–66 season, averaging 25.7 points and 10.6 rebounds per game, though the team finished 35–45 and missed the playoffs. Thurmond complemented Barry's scoring with elite rebounding and shot-blocking, averaging 18.7 points and 18.0 rebounds in 1965–66, establishing himself as one of the league's premier interior defenders.

In the 1966–67 season, the Warriors achieved a 44–37 record to claim the Western Division title, propelled by Barry's league-leading 35.6 points per game and Thurmond's 21.3 points and 18.7 rebounds. They advanced to the NBA Finals but lost to the Philadelphia 76ers 4–2, with Barry hampered by injuries late in the series. Following the season, Barry departed for the ABA amid a contract dispute with Warriors ownership over unpaid bonuses, sitting out the 1967–68 NBA season due to a lawsuit before joining the Oakland Oaks. Without Barry, the Warriors posted a 43–39 record in 1967–68 and reached the Western Division Finals, but subsequent seasons saw inconsistency, including a league-worst 30–52 mark in 1969–70; Thurmond remained a defensive stalwart, recording the first quadruple-double in NBA history on October 18, 1968 (22 points, 14 rebounds, 13 assists, 12 blocks). The franchise rebranded as the Golden State Warriors in 1970.

Barry returned to the Warriors in December 1972 after his ABA contract expired, revitalizing the team to playoff appearances in each of his remaining full seasons. The 1973–74 campaign featured Barry's career-high 64 points in a single game against the Portland Trail Blazers on March 26, 1974. In 1974–75, despite a 48–34 regular-season record and the sixth seed overall, the Warriors upset higher-seeded teams en route to sweeping the 60-win Washington Bullets 4–0 in the Finals; Barry earned Finals MVP with averages of 29.5 points, 4.0 rebounds, and 5.0 assists per game. Thurmond had been traded to the Chicago Bulls in 1974 for Clifford Ray, who contributed to the title run with rebounding support. The Warriors followed with a franchise-record 59–23 mark in 1975–76, winning the Pacific Division but falling in Game 7 of the Western Conference Finals to the Phoenix Suns amid Barry's criticized performance in the decisive game. The era concluded in 1978 as Barry signed with the Houston Rockets following another contract impasse, with the Warriors finishing 43–39 and missing the playoffs.

### Rebuilding struggles (1978–1985)

Following Rick Barry's retirement after the 1977–78 season, during which the Warriors finished 48–34 and lost in the Western Conference semifinals, the franchise entered a period of roster depletion and competitive decline. Key contributors like Jamaal Wilkes had been traded to the Los Angeles Clippers in September 1977 for forward Sidney Wicks and guard Dave Robisch, while center Nate Thurmond retired in 1976; these losses, combined with Barry's departure, left the team without its core scoring and rebounding threats. The 1978–79 season saw a 38–44 record under coach Al Attles, finishing sixth in the Pacific Division and out of the playoffs, with guard Phil Smith leading the team in scoring at 21.6 points per game.

The struggles intensified in 1979–80 with a league-worst 24–58 mark, prompting front-office decisions that exacerbated the rebuild. On June 9, 1980, the Warriors traded center Robert Parish—who had averaged 17.0 points and 10.7 rebounds in his final season with Golden State—and their own 1980 first-round draft pick (the No. 3 overall selection, used by Boston to draft Kevin McHale) to the Boston Celtics for the Celtics' 1980 first-round pick (No. 13 overall, used to select Joe Barry Carroll). This exchange, intended to acquire a perceived high-upside center in Carroll (who debuted with 18.7 points and 7.7 rebounds per game in 1980–81 but was plagued by injuries and inconsistency), instead handed Boston foundational pieces for their 1980s dynasty while yielding diminishing returns for Golden State. The 1980–81 season improved marginally to 39–43, buoyed by Carroll and forward Purvis Short's 19.2 points per game, but the team again missed the playoffs.

A brief resurgence occurred in 1981–82, when the Warriors posted a 45–37 record—their best since 1977—and earned a playoff spot as the Pacific Division's fourth seed, defeating the Houston Rockets 2–1 in the first round before falling 4–1 to the Denver Nuggets in the conference semifinals; guard Gus Williams averaged 20.5 points, but internal chemistry issues and defensive lapses contributed to the early exit. However, regression followed, with Attles reassigned on March 13, 1983, amid a 30–52 finish in 1982–83, marking the team's third straight non-playoff year. Johnny Bach took over as head coach for 1983–84 (37–45 record) and 1984–85 (22–60, last in the Pacific), as reliance on aging veterans like forward Clifford Ray and inconsistent production from guards like Sleepy Floyd failed to stem the tide of losses, averaging just 104.6 points per game in 1984–85 while allowing 111.5. Ownership instability and draft misses, such as selecting forward Scott Hastings 11th overall in 1982 (who averaged 2.0 points in limited minutes), compounded the inability to build a sustainable contender, resulting in no All-Star selections or significant free-agent influx during the era.

### Run TMC and early 1990s promise (1985–1997)

The Warriors selected forward Chris Mullin with the seventh overall pick in the 1985 NBA draft, providing a foundational scoring option amid ongoing rebuilding efforts. In 1988, the team appointed Don Nelson as head coach and general manager, ushering in an up-tempo, run-and-gun offensive system emphasizing speed and perimeter shooting. That year, Golden State drafted shooting guard Mitch Richmond fifth overall, who quickly emerged as a reliable scorer averaging 17.0 points per game as a rookie. The following season, the Warriors selected point guard Tim Hardaway 14th overall in the 1989 draft; Hardaway's crossover dribble and playmaking instantly complemented Richmond and Mullin, forming the high-octane trio dubbed "Run TMC" for their fast-break prowess.

Under Nelson's direction, Run TMC powered a league-leading scoring average, with the trio combining for 72.5 points per game in the 1990–91 season—Mullin at 25.7, Richmond at 23.4, and Hardaway at 23.4. The Warriors posted a 43–39 record in 1988–89, qualifying for the playoffs and defeating the Utah Jazz 3–0 in the first round before falling 4–1 to the Phoenix Suns in the Western Conference semifinals. They regressed to 37–45 in 1989–90, missing the postseason, but rebounded to 44–38 in 1990–91, advancing to the first round where they lost 3–2 to the Los Angeles Lakers despite Hardaway's 26.5 points per game average. The group's chemistry and pace influenced modern NBA offenses, though defensive vulnerabilities and lack of interior depth limited deeper runs.

Seeking balance, Nelson traded Richmond to the Sacramento Kings on November 1, 1991, for forward Billy Owens and a future pick, aiming to add size against dominant big men like Shaquille O'Neal. The move initially succeeded, propelling the Warriors to franchise-best 55–27 and 52–30 records in 1991–92 and 1992–93, respectively; they upset the Suns 3–0 in the 1993 first round but lost 4–3 in the Western Conference finals amid Mullin's 25.2 points per game playoff output. Consecutive first-round exits followed: a 4–3 loss to the Lakers in 1992 (after leading 2–0) and a 3–0 sweep by the Suns in 1994. Nelson's tenure peaked in 1994–95 with a 59–23 mark, including a 3–2 upset over the Jazz before a 4–3 Western Conference finals defeat to the Houston Rockets, who went on to win the championship.

Nelson's firing after the 1994–95 season marked the end of the promise, as injuries to Hardaway (who missed 47 games in 1995–96 due to knee issues) and Mullin contributed to a slide. Under new coach P.J. Carlesimo, the Warriors managed 36–46 in 1995–96 (missing playoffs) and 48–34 in 1996–97 (losing 3–2 to the Jazz in the first round), but persistent defensive lapses and roster turnover eroded the early-1990s momentum. The era showcased offensive innovation but underscored the need for defensive reinforcements and health, factors that ultimately prevented a title.

### Decline and "We Believe" upset (1997–2009)

The Golden State Warriors experienced a prolonged period of sub-.500 records and playoff absences following the end of their early 1990s contention window, compiling a 280–424 regular-season mark from 1997 to 2009 excluding the shortened 1998–99 lockout season. Under coach P. J. Carlesimo, the team finished 19–63 in 1997–98, prompting his dismissal after a 3–31 start the following year; interim coach Dave Cowens could not salvage the season, ending 21–29 in the abbreviated 50-game schedule. The franchise drafted forward Antawn Jamison fourth overall in 1998, who emerged as the leading scorer with 19.8 points per game from 1999 to 2004 before being traded to Dallas in 2004 for Speedy Claxton and Etan Thomas.

Subsequent seasons yielded minimal progress, with records of 19–31 in 1999–2000, 17–65 in 2000–01, and 19–63 in 2001–02, marking the worst three-year span in franchise history by wins. The 2001 draft brought guard Jason Richardson fifth overall, a high-flying athlete who won consecutive Slam Dunk Contests in 2002 and 2003 and averaged 17.1 points per game from 2001 to 2007. Guard Gilbert Arenas, undrafted in 2001 but signed as a free agent, contributed 13.6 points per game over two seasons before being traded to Washington in 2003 for Penny Hardaway, whose injury-plagued tenure yielded only 23 games. Coaches Garry St. Jean (1997–2000) and Brian Winters (2000–2003) prioritized youth development, but front-office decisions, including the 2003 trade of Arenas, hindered contention.

A brief uptick occurred under coach Eric Musselman, who guided the team to 38–44 in 2002–03—the first winning record since 1994—fueled by Richardson's breakout (20.8 points per game) and Jamison's All-Star selection. Musselman was fired after back-to-back 37–45 (2003–04) and 34–48 (2004–05) seasons, despite acquiring Stephen Jackson from Indiana in 2004 for Mike Dunleavy Jr. and adding Andris Biedrins in the 2004 draft. Mike Montgomery took over in 2005, inheriting a roster bolstered by guard Baron Davis, signed to a five-year, $73 million contract via sign-and-trade with New Orleans, and late-second-round pick Monta Ellis (40th overall in 2005). The 2005–06 team finished 34–48, missing the playoffs narrowly.

Don Nelson returned as head coach on June 27, 2006, implementing an up-tempo offense that propelled the 2006–07 Warriors to 42–40 and the No. 8 seed in the Western Conference. Facing the top-seeded Dallas Mavericks (67–15 record and MVP Dirk Nowitzki), the Warriors staged a stunning first-round upset, winning 4–2; Davis averaged 32.4 points and 3.8 assists, including a memorable crossover dribble against Nowitzki in Game 3. The series, dubbed the "We Believe" upset by fans and media for its improbable nature against a 67-win opponent, ended Dallas's season and marked Golden State's first playoff series win since 1991. The team fell to Utah in the second round (4–1), with Davis posting 25.8 points per game.

The momentum carried into 2007–08, where Nelson's squad achieved 48–34—the franchise's best record since 1993–94—behind Davis (22.8 points, 7.6 assists), Richardson (19.5 points), and Ellis (16.5 points in 81 games). As the No. 7 seed, they lost to the Lakers 4–1 in the first round. Tensions boiled over, leading to Davis's trade to the Clippers on February 21, 2008, for Jason Kapono, Al Thornton, and cash considerations; the deal signaled the end of the core's viability. The 2008–09 season reverted to 29–53 under Nelson, who was fired midseason after a 26–39 start, with Keith Smart finishing 3–14. This era underscored persistent organizational instability, with 12 consecutive pre-2007 playoff misses and only sporadic draft successes amid frequent coaching changes and asset mismanagement.

### Stephen Curry era: Foundations and rise (2009–2014)

The Golden State Warriors selected Stephen Curry, a guard from Davidson College, with the seventh overall pick in the 2009 NBA Draft on June 25. In his rookie season of 2009–10, Curry averaged 17.5 points, 5.9 assists, and 4.5 rebounds per game over 80 appearances, helping the team to a 26–56 record while missing the playoffs. The following year, 2010–11, Curry dealt with recurring right ankle issues, including a sprain that required offseason surgery, yet the Warriors improved to 36–46 and earned a playoff berth, only to lose 4–2 to the San Antonio Spurs in the first round.

Persistent ankle injuries sidelined Curry for most of the 2011–12 season, limiting him to 26 games where he averaged 14.7 points per game; the team finished 24–43 under interim coach Keith Smart after Don Nelson's dismissal. In June 2011, the Warriors hired Mark Jackson, a former NBA point guard with no prior head coaching experience, as their new head coach on a multi-year deal. The franchise bolstered its backcourt by drafting Klay Thompson, a shooting guard from Washington State, eleventh overall in the 2011 NBA Draft. On March 13, 2012, the Warriors traded guard Monta Ellis, forward Ekpe Udoh, and center Kwame Brown to the Milwaukee Bucks for center Andrew Bogut and forward Stephen Jackson, clearing the path for Curry to emerge as the primary ball-handler despite initial considerations of trading Curry himself.

The 2012 NBA Draft added forward Draymond Green from Michigan State with the thirty-fifth overall pick in the second round, a selection acquired earlier via trade. Curry underwent right ankle surgery in April 2012 to address chronic instability, missing the entire offseason but returning stronger. Under Jackson's emphasis on pace and three-point shooting, the Warriors surged to a 47–35 record in 2012–13, securing the sixth seed in the Western Conference playoffs; they upset the Denver Nuggets 4–2 in the first round before falling 4–2 to the Spurs in the semifinals, with Curry averaging 23.5 points per game across 13 playoff contests.

Building on this momentum, the 2013–14 season saw the Warriors achieve a 51–31 mark, again earning the sixth seed, though they lost 4–3 to the Los Angeles Clippers in the first round amid controversy over a Game 6 suspension of Bogut. Curry's performance elevated to 24.8 points, 8.5 assists, and 4.2 rebounds per game, establishing him as an All-Star. Following Jackson's firing on May 6, 2014, amid reported internal conflicts, the Warriors hired Steve Kerr— a seven-time NBA champion as a player and executive with no head coaching experience—on May 14, 2014, to a five-year, $25 million contract, signaling a strategic shift toward advanced analytics and player development. This period laid the groundwork for the team's transformation through Curry's shooting prowess, key acquisitions like Thompson and Green, and the Ellis trade, which prioritized long-term versatility over short-term scoring despite injury risks.

### Dynasty dominance (2014–2019)

In May 2014, the Golden State Warriors hired Steve Kerr as head coach on a five-year, $25 million contract, marking his first head coaching position after turning down an offer from the New York Knicks. Kerr implemented an up-tempo, three-point-heavy offensive system emphasizing the play of guards Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson alongside forward Draymond Green. In the 2014–15 season, the Warriors compiled a franchise-record 67–15 regular season mark, finishing first in the Western Conference. They swept the New Orleans Pelicans in the first round, defeated the Houston Rockets 4–1 in the Western Conference semifinals, and beat the Memphis Grizzlies 4–2 in the conference finals before overcoming the Cleveland Cavaliers 4–2 in the NBA Finals for their first championship since 1975; Andre Iguodala earned Finals MVP honors. Curry captured the league MVP award, averaging 23.8 points, 7.7 assists, and 2.0 steals per game.

The 2015–16 season saw the Warriors shatter the NBA single-season wins record with a 73–9 mark, surpassing the 1995–96 Chicago Bulls' 72 victories, fueled by Curry's league-leading 30.1 points per game and a record 402 three-pointers made. Curry became the first unanimous MVP in NBA history, receiving all 131 first-place votes. Despite advancing to the Finals again, the Warriors squandered a 3–1 series lead and lost to the Cavaliers 4–3, with Cleveland's comeback highlighted by LeBron James' performance and Golden State's fatigue from the record regular season.

Following the defeat, the Warriors signed free agent Kevin Durant to a two-year, $54.3 million contract on July 7, 2016, forming a superstar lineup with Curry, Thompson, Green, and Durant. In 2016–17, they returned to the Finals and defeated the Cavaliers 4–1, with Durant earning Finals MVP after averaging 35.2 points per game in the series. The team repeated as champions in 2017–18, sweeping the Cavaliers 4–0 in the Finals; Durant again won Finals MVP, while Curry scored 37 points in the clincher. This period established the Warriors' dynasty, securing three titles in four years through superior spacing, shooting efficiency, and defensive versatility led by Green's playmaking from the center position.

The dynasty concluded in the 2018–19 Finals, where the Warriors lost to the Toronto Raptors 2–4 despite rallying from a 3–1 deficit to force Game 6; Durant's calf injury sidelined him after one game, and Thompson suffered an ACL tear in Game 6. Injuries undermined what had been a dominant run, with the core group's integration of Durant amplifying their offensive firepower—averaging over 113 points per game across the championship seasons—but exposing vulnerabilities in depth and health during the 2019 postseason.

### Post-dynasty challenges and relocation (2019–2022)

The Golden State Warriors' dynasty faltered in the 2019 NBA Finals, where they lost 4–2 to the Toronto Raptors amid severe injuries to key players. Kevin Durant, sidelined since May 2019 with a calf strain, ruptured his Achilles tendon in Game 5 upon returning, while Klay Thompson tore his left ACL in Game 6. Stephen Curry also missed time due to a hamstring strain during the series. These injuries, compounded by Durant's subsequent departure as a free agent to the Brooklyn Nets in July 2019—citing factors including a public altercation with Draymond Green—marked the end of the superteam era.

In tandem with roster upheaval, the franchise relocated from Oakland's Oracle Arena to the newly constructed Chase Center in San Francisco, which opened on September 6, 2019, ahead of the 2019–20 season. The move, planned since 2012 and funded by a $1.6 billion project, shifted the team from its East Bay roots to the city's Mission Bay neighborhood, drawing criticism from some Oakland loyalists who viewed it as abandoning working-class fans. Despite the gleaming 18,064-seat arena featuring advanced amenities like the Oracle Park practice facility, the Warriors struggled on the court, finishing the shortened 2019–20 season with a 15–50 record, their worst since 2004–05, exacerbated by Curry's fractured left hand in November 2019 that sidelined him for all but five games. The team missed the playoffs for the first time since 2013, playing home games at Chase Center before the COVID-19 pandemic suspended the season in March 2020.

Thompson's recovery was further derailed when he tore his right Achilles tendon during a November 2020 workout, causing him to miss the entire 2020–21 season as well. Curry returned to All-NBA form, averaging 32.0 points per game and earning third-team honors, but the Warriors posted a 39–33 record and lost in the play-in tournament to the Los Angeles Lakers on May 19, 2021. Internal tensions persisted, including Green's indefinite suspension in December 2021 for striking teammate Jordan Poole during practice, though he was reinstated after three games. These setbacks, alongside the departures of veterans like Andre Iguodala—traded to the Memphis Grizzlies in July 2019 for draft assets—tested the franchise's resilience amid the transition to a new venue and uncertain roster.

### Fourth championship and immediate aftermath (2021–2023)

The Golden State Warriors entered the 2021–22 NBA season having missed the playoffs the previous year due to season-ending injuries to Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green. Key offseason moves included signing veteran forward Otto Porter Jr. to a two-year, $25.8 million contract and Gary Payton II to a one-year deal, bolstering depth around the core trio, while Andrew Wiggins transitioned from a trade acquisition to a permanent starter. The team started strongly, winning 18 of their first 20 games, but injuries to Porter and Payton contributed to a midseason slump, finishing with a 53–29 record and the third seed in the Western Conference.

In the playoffs, the Warriors defeated the Denver Nuggets 4–1 in the first round, overcoming a Jamal Murray-led challenge without Aaron Gordon's full impact. They advanced past the Memphis Grizzlies 4–2 in the semifinals, where rookie Desmond Bane and Ja Morant provided resistance but faltered against Golden State's experience. The Western Conference Finals saw a 4–1 victory over the Dallas Mavericks, despite Luka Dončić's 30.7 points per game average, as the Warriors' defense limited Dallas's supporting cast. In the NBA Finals against the Boston Celtics, Golden State prevailed 4–2, clinching the series with a 103–90 Game 6 win on June 16, 2022, at TD Garden; Stephen Curry averaged 31.2 points, 6.0 rebounds, and 5.0 assists, earning Finals MVP honors. This marked the franchise's fourth title in eight years and seventh overall.

The championship parade in San Francisco on June 20, 2022, drew an estimated 1 million fans, celebrating the return to dynasty form amid Chase Center's opening the prior year. On October 18, 2022, prior to their season-opening 123–109 win over the Los Angeles Lakers, the Warriors received their championship rings—crafted with 180 diamonds and a removable top symbolizing the Bay Bridge—and raised a banner at Chase Center.

The 2022–23 season as defending champions began with internal discord, highlighted by a preseason practice altercation on October 5, 2022, where Draymond Green punched teammate Jordan Poole following a verbal exchange, fracturing team chemistry and drawing public scrutiny. Green received a one-game suspension, but the incident contributed to Poole's diminished role and eventual trade. The Warriors finished 44–38, securing the sixth seed in the West amid Curry's two-month ankle injury absence from February 4 to March 2023 and Green's multiple ejections and suspensions for on-court conduct. In the playoffs, they upset the Sacramento Kings 4–3 in the first round, highlighted by a Game 7 comeback from 21 points down, but fell 4–2 to the Lakers in the semifinals, with LeBron James and Anthony Davis dominating the frontcourt. These challenges signaled a transition from championship cohesion, exacerbated by the departures of Porter and Payton due to free agency and injury limitations.

### Transition and playoff contention (2023–present)

Following the 2022 NBA championship, the Warriors entered a transitional phase marked by roster instability, disciplinary issues, and efforts to integrate younger talent around Stephen Curry. In the 2023–24 regular season, the team compiled a 46–36 record, finishing as the Western Conference's 10th seed amid inconsistent performance and off-court controversies. Draymond Green faced two significant suspensions: a five-game ban on November 21, 2023, for choking Minnesota Timberwolves center Rudy Gobert during a November 14 game, followed by an indefinite suspension on December 13, 2023, for striking Phoenix Suns center Jusuf Nurkic in the head, which resulted in 12 games missed before his reinstatement on January 6, 2024. These incidents contributed to early-season struggles, with the Warriors posting a sub-.500 record through December, though they rallied with 10 wins in their final 12 games to secure a play-in spot.

In the play-in tournament, Golden State defeated the ninth-seeded Sacramento Kings 118–94 on April 16, 2024, advancing to face the eighth-seeded Los Angeles Lakers, but fell 122–99 on April 19, ending their postseason. Curry led the team with 26.4 points, 4.5 rebounds, and 5.1 assists per game, maintaining elite shooting efficiency despite the supporting cast's uneven contributions, including Klay Thompson's demotion to the bench mid-season amid a career-low 43.2% field goal percentage. Emerging players like Jonathan Kuminga and Brandin Podziemski showed promise, with Kuminga averaging 16.1 points in his final 40 games, signaling a shift toward youth development under general manager Mike Dunleavy Jr.

The 2024 offseason crystallized the transition, as Thompson declined a two-year, $48 million extension and departed via a multi-team sign-and-trade to the Dallas Mavericks on July 6, 2024, signing a three-year, $50 million contract. This move ended the 12-year partnership of the Curry-Thompson-Green core that defined four titles, driven by contract disputes, Thompson's injury history, and the franchise's pivot to cost efficiency amid luxury tax constraints. In response, the Warriors acquired Buddy Hield from the Philadelphia 76ers and Kyle Anderson via trade, bolstering perimeter shooting and versatility while retaining Curry and Green on restructured deals. Green's ongoing behavioral issues persisted into counseling requirements from his suspension, yet he recommitted to team leadership.

The 2024–25 season reflected renewed contention, with a 48–34 record earning the seventh seed in the West. Curry's scoring prowess anchored the offense, supported by improved cohesion from Podziemski and Kuminga, though Green's technical fouls and ejections remained flashpoints. The team advanced to the playoffs but suffered an early exit after Curry sustained a hamstring injury, underscoring vulnerabilities in an aging core and injury-prone roster. As of October 2025, the Warriors continued integrating additions like De'Anthony Melton while prioritizing Curry's health and defensive schemes under Steve Kerr, positioning for sustained Western Conference relevance amid a competitive landscape.

## Ownership and management

### Franchise ownership

The Philadelphia Warriors franchise was established in 1946 as one of the original teams in the Basketball Association of America (BAA) by promoter Eddie Gottlieb, who owned and operated the team until its relocation to San Francisco in 1962. Gottlieb, a longtime basketball figure, managed the franchise through its early championships in 1947 and 1956, emphasizing competitive rosters amid the league's merger into the NBA in 1949.

Following the 1962 move and rebranding as the San Francisco Warriors, control shifted to a syndicate including Franklin Mieuli and the Diners Club in 1963, with Mieuli assuming primary ownership by 1965 and holding it until 1986. Mieuli's tenure oversaw the 1975 NBA championship but was marked by financial instability, including a 1976 bankruptcy filing resolved through league intervention and partial ownership stakes sold to figures like Patrick E. Foley. In 1987, the franchise was acquired by a group led by Jim Fitzgerald, who sold it in 1994 to Christopher Cohan for $38.5 million; Cohan retained ownership through a period of on-court struggles until 2010.

In July 2010, Cohan sold the Warriors to an investment group headed by venture capitalist Joe Lacob and entertainment executive Peter Guber for $450 million, a transaction approved by the NBA Board of Governors. Lacob, holding the majority stake, serves as co-executive chairman and CEO, while Guber acts as co-executive chairman, with the group focusing on infrastructure investments like the 2019 opening of Chase Center.  As of October 2025, Lacob and Guber remain the principal owners, with no reported changes in controlling interest despite the franchise's valuation exceeding $8 billion amid sustained success.

### Key executives and general managers

Mike Dunleavy Jr. was promoted to general manager of the Golden State Warriors on June 16, 2023, succeeding Bob Myers in the role. Entering his sixth season in the Warriors' front office at the time of promotion, Dunleavy had previously served as vice president of basketball operations for two years, focusing on player personnel and scouting decisions. As of October 2025, under his leadership, the team has navigated salary cap constraints and roster transitions following the departure of key veterans, emphasizing youth development and mid-level acquisitions amid competitive Western Conference play.

Bob Myers held the general manager position from April 2012 until May 30, 2023, and was elevated to president of basketball operations in 2017, overseeing four NBA championships in 2015, 2017, 2018, and 2022. Myers joined the organization in April 2011 as assistant general manager and vice president of basketball operations, contributing to foundational moves such as extending Stephen Curry's contract in 2012 and hiring head coach Steve Kerr in 2014. He received the NBA Executive of the Year award in 2015 and 2017 for orchestrating draft selections, free-agent signings like Kevin Durant in 2016, and trades that sustained contention despite injuries and cap challenges.

Prior general managers include Larry Riley, who served from 2009 to 2012 and facilitated the 2009 draft acquisition of Stephen Curry at the seventh overall pick, laying groundwork for the franchise's later success despite a 85-145 regular-season record during his tenure. Chris Mullin acted as executive vice president of basketball operations from 2004 to 2009, influencing drafts that included Andris Biedrins (2004) and Monta Ellis (2005 via trade), though the team compiled a 187-223 record and one playoff appearance in that span.

| General Manager          | Tenure      | Championships | NBA Exec. of the Year |
|--------------------------|-------------|---------------|-----------------------|
| Bob Myers                | 2012–2023  | 4             | 2015, 2017            |
| Larry Riley              | 2009–2012  | 0             | None                  |

### Head coaching history

The Golden State Warriors franchise has had 25 head coaches since its founding as the Philadelphia Warriors in 1946, encompassing the Basketball Association of America (BAA), its merger into the NBA, and subsequent relocations to San Francisco and Oakland before settling in the San Francisco Bay Area. These coaches have compiled a combined regular-season record of 3,018–3,168 (.488 winning percentage) over 80 seasons through the 2024–25 campaign, with playoff appearances yielding additional contests and seven championships: in 1947, 1956, 1975, 2015, 2017, 2018, and 2022. Early coaches like Eddie Gottlieb and George Senesky oversaw the franchise's initial titles during its Philadelphia era, while Al Attles guided the 1975 championship sweep of the Washington Bullets. The modern dynasty under Steve Kerr, who assumed the role in May 2014, accounts for four of those titles and features the highest winning percentage (.648) and most playoff victories (104–48) among Warriors coaches.

Don Nelson holds the distinction of coaching the most games without a championship (865 regular-season games across two stints from 1988–95 and 2006–10), emphasizing a fast-paced, high-scoring style that influenced later Warriors offenses but yielded only modest playoff success (14–21). Al Attles coached the longest continuous tenure (1,075 games from 1970–83), blending player-coach roles early on and achieving a .518 regular-season mark with the 1975 title. Kerr's era, marked by innovative spacing and three-point emphasis, produced the franchise's best regular-season record (73–9 in 2015–16) and earned him the NBA Coach of the Year award that season, though subsequent Finals losses in 2016 and 2019 highlighted vulnerabilities in late-game execution and roster depth.

Records reflect games coached through the end of the 2024–25 season; Kerr's tenure continues into 2025–26. Interim or partial-season coaches like Ed Gregory are included where they led the team in regular-season games.

## Facilities

### Home arenas and training facilities

The Philadelphia Warriors played their home games primarily at Philadelphia Arena from 1946 to 1952. From 1952 until the franchise's relocation in 1962, the team split its schedule between Philadelphia Arena and Philadelphia Convention Hall.

Following the move to San Francisco in 1962, the Warriors' primary venue was the Cow Palace, where they played most games from 1962 to 1971, supplemented by dates at San Francisco Civic Auditorium (capacity 8,500) from 1964 to 1966 and the University of San Francisco's War Memorial Gymnasium (capacity 5,300) during the same period. In 1971, the franchise relocated across the bay to Oakland Coliseum Arena, which had opened in 1966 as a multi-purpose venue; the Warriors used it exclusively thereafter until the end of the 2018–19 season, following a major renovation completed in 1996 that renamed it Oracle Arena.

The team's current home arena is Chase Center, located in San Francisco's Mission Bay neighborhood, which hosted its first Warriors regular-season game on October 24, 2019, against the Los Angeles Clippers. Chase Center, with a seating capacity of 18,064 for basketball, serves as the primary venue for Warriors games and events.

Chase Center also incorporates the Biofreeze Performance Center as the franchise's main training facility, featuring two full-length basketball courts, six hoops, a 4,000-square-foot weight room, locker rooms, training areas, and operational offices. Prior to 2019, the Warriors conducted practices at a dedicated headquarters facility in Oakland, operational from 1997 onward, which later transitioned to use by the affiliated Golden State Valkyries WNBA team.

## Team identity

### Logos and uniforms

The Golden State Warriors' primary logo, introduced in 2010, consists of a royal blue circle outlined in golden yellow enclosing a stylized black silhouette of the eastern span of the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge, evoking the team's statewide California identity adopted in 1971. This design replaced earlier iterations, including a 1997 version featuring a masked figure holding a lightning bolt attached to the "W" in "Warriors." In June 2024, a new secondary logo was unveiled, depicting a "W" stylized as a basketball net post-swish, developed in collaboration with design firm Silverstein Goodby \u0026 Partners.

The franchise's logo history traces back to its 1946 founding as the Philadelphia Warriors, with an initial emblem showing a Native American dribbling a basketball, inspired by the team's name drawn from a local Philadelphia arena. Following the 1962 relocation to San Francisco, logos shifted to reflect West Coast roots, culminating in the 1971 Bay Bridge motif upon the "Golden State" rebranding to encompass all of California rather than just the city.

The team's official colors are Warriors royal blue (#1D4FA4), California golden yellow (#FDB927), and white, consistent since the 2010 redesign. These hues appear across uniforms manufactured by Nike since the 2017 NBA partnership, succeeding adidas (2006–2017), Reebok (2002–2006), and earlier brands.

Warriors uniforms follow NBA conventions with icon edition (royal blue home alternate), association edition (white road), statement edition (navy with prominent "Golden State" lettering and gold accents), and annual city edition variants. The statement jersey, introduced in the 2017–18 season, emphasizes the full "Golden State" name adopted in 1971. For the 2025–26 season, the city edition honors "The Town" theme, building on Oakland heritage amid frequent throwback usage in recent years, including 18 distinct designs since 2016.

### Nicknames and branding evolution

The franchise originated as the Philadelphia Warriors upon its founding in 1946 as a charter member of the Basketball Association of America, which merged into the NBA in 1949. Following relocation to San Francisco in 1962, the team adopted the name San Francisco Warriors to align with its new geographic base. In 1971, after moving across the bay to Oakland's Oakland Coliseum Arena, ownership rebranded the team as the Golden State Warriors, drawing from California's official nickname "The Golden State" to evoke statewide representation rather than tying the identity to a single city, a strategic choice amid the era's urban shifts and to broaden appeal beyond local boundaries.  This name has remained unchanged since, underscoring a consistent branding emphasis on regional expansiveness over municipal specificity, even as home games alternated between Oakland and San Francisco from 2019 onward.

Informally, the Warriors acquired the nickname "Dubs" in the 1990s, originating among younger fans as a phonetic shorthand for "W's," abbreviating "Warriors" for brevity in casual discourse, texting, and early online platforms where "W" also connoted victories.  The term gained widespread traction during the team's mid-2010s resurgence, with supporters self-identifying as "Dub Nation" to signify a unified, national-scale fanbase transcending the Bay Area. This evolution mirrored broader NBA trends toward phonetic, media-friendly monikers that facilitate quick references in broadcasts and social media, without altering the official name but enhancing marketable familiarity.

Branding has further developed through era-specific slogans tied to on-court narratives, such as "We Believe" during the 2006–07 playoff upset of the Dallas Mavericks, which galvanized local fandom amid skepticism from national outlets. From 2014 onward, "Strength in Numbers" encapsulated the collective ethos of the Steve Kerr-led dynasty, emphasizing depth and versatility over star-centric narratives, a motif reinforced in marketing campaigns amid four championships between 2015 and 2022. In May 2025, the franchise's parent entity underwent a corporate rebrand to simply "Golden State" to position itself as a multifaceted sports and entertainment conglomerate, extending beyond basketball while preserving the team's full moniker. These shifts reflect pragmatic adaptations to fan engagement, media dynamics, and business diversification, prioritizing empirical success metrics like win totals and attendance over ideological reframing.

## Roster and personnel

### Current roster (as of October 2025)

As of October 25, 2025, the Golden State Warriors maintain a 15-player active roster for the 2025–26 NBA season, supplemented by two-way contract players, following the league's standard composition after training camp cuts and preseason transactions. Key additions include veteran forward Jimmy Butler III, acquired via trade, and rookie center Quinten Post, selected in the 2025 NBA Draft, alongside extensions for core players like Stephen Curry and Draymond Green.

The roster emphasizes shooting and versatility, with Curry anchoring the backcourt and Green providing defensive flexibility, though aging stars like Al Horford (39 years old) introduce depth risks at center. No players are currently listed on the injured reserve at season's start, though De'Anthony Melton has a history of ailments.

| No. | Player | Position | Height | Weight | Experience |
|-----|--------|----------|--------|--------|------------|
| 0   | Gary Payton II | G | 6 ft 2 in (1.88 m) | 195 lb (88 kg) | 9 years |
| 1   | Jonathan Kuminga | F | 6 ft 7 in (2.01 m) | 225 lb (102 kg) | 4 years |
| 2   | Brandin Podziemski | G | 6 ft 4 in (1.93 m) | 205 lb (93 kg) | 2 years |
| 3   | Will Richard | G | 6 ft 3 in (1.91 m) | 206 lb (93 kg) | Rookie |
| 4   | Moses Moody | G/F | 6 ft 5 in (1.96 m) | 211 lb (96 kg) | 4 years |
| 7   | Buddy Hield | G | 6 ft 4 in (1.93 m) | 220 lb (100 kg) | 9 years |
| 8   | De'Anthony Melton | G | 6 ft 2 in (1.88 m) | 200 lb (91 kg) | 7 years |
| 10  | Jimmy Butler III | F | 6 ft 6 in (1.98 m) | 230 lb (104 kg) | 14 years |
| 15  | Gui Santos | F | 6 ft 7 in (2.01 m) | 185 lb (84 kg) | 2 years |
| 20  | Al Horford | C | 6 ft 8 in (2.03 m) | 240 lb (109 kg) | 18 years |
| 21  | Quinten Post | C | 7 ft 0 in (2.13 m) | 238 lb (108 kg) | Rookie |
| 22  | Alex Toohey | F | 6 ft 8 in (2.03 m) | 223 lb (101 kg) | Rookie |
| 23  | Draymond Green | F/C | 6 ft 6 in (1.98 m) | 230 lb (104 kg) | 13 years |
| 30  | Stephen Curry | G | 6 ft 2 in (1.88 m) | 185 lb (84 kg) | 16 years |
| 32  | Trayce Jackson-Davis | F/C | 6 ft 9 in (2.06 m) | 245 lb (111 kg) | 2 years |

Two-way contract players include Pat Spencer (G, #61) and Jackson Rowe (F, #44), eligible for up to 50 regular-season games with the NBA team.

### Retained draft rights

The Golden State Warriors signed their 2025 NBA Draft second-round selections, forward Alex Toohey (acquired via trade from the Phoenix Suns as the No. 52 overall pick) and guard Will Richard (No. 56 overall), to NBA contracts in September 2025, exhausting rights to those prospects. Toohey received a two-way deal after playing professionally in Australia, while Richard, a former Florida Gator, inked a standard rookie contract following his college championship season.

Earlier in the offseason, the Warriors traded away long-held rights to 2020 second-round pick Justinian Jessup (No. 51 overall) to the Memphis Grizzlies as part of a deal to acquire Richard's selection, ending a five-year retention period during which Jessup played overseas without signing an NBA contract. Similarly, draft rights to guard Jahmai Mashack (No. 59 overall, acquired from Houston via trade) were flipped to Memphis in a multi-team transaction involving Richard, marking no net retention from late-second-round maneuvering.

As of October 2025, the franchise holds no retained draft rights to unsigned players from drafts since 2015, with historical holdings like those to center Cady Lalanne (2015, No. 55 via trade) remaining technically active but inactive for practical purposes due to elapsed time and lack of NBA development. This leaves the Warriors without international or developmental prospects under exclusive negotiation rights heading into the 2025–26 season.

### Retired numbers

The Golden State Warriors have retired seven jersey numbers in honor of franchise contributors, recognizing their on-court achievements and lasting impact. These retirements began in the late 1960s and continued into 2025, with ceremonies typically held during home games. The league-wide retirement of No. 6 for Bill Russell in 2022 is also honored by the Warriors, though it is not a team-specific distinction.

| No. | Name              | Position | Years with Warriors     | Date retired     |
|-----|-------------------|----------|-------------------------|------------------|
| 9   | Andre Iguodala   | G/F     | 2013–2019, 2021–2023   | February 23, 2025 |
| 13  | Wilt Chamberlain | C       | 1959–1965              | December 29, 1999 |
| 14  | Tom Meschery     | F       | 1961–1967              | October 13, 1967 |
| 16  | Al Attles        | G       | 1960–1971              | February 10, 1977 |
| 17  | Chris Mullin     | G/F     | 1985–1997, 2000–2001   | March 19, 2012   |
| 24  | Rick Barry       | F       | 1965–1967, 1972–1978   | March 18, 1988   |
| 42  | Nate Thurmond    | C       | 1963–1974              | March 8, 1978    |

Iguodala's retirement marked the most recent addition, celebrating his role as a key defensive specialist and 2015 Finals MVP during the team's dynasty era. Chamberlain's number was retired posthumously, acknowledging his dominant early tenure despite the franchise's Philadelphia roots at the time. Meschery's early retirement reflected his contributions as a reliable forward and poet, with the number briefly integrated into team branding post-ceremony. Attles earned honors for his playing longevity and subsequent executive roles, while Barry and Thurmond represent the 1970s championship core, with Barry's underhand free-throw style and Thurmond's rebounding prowess defining eras. Mullin's number salutes his scoring efficiency and Bay Area loyalty across two stints. No numbers have been retired for coaches or non-players exclusively.

### Naismith Hall of Fame inductees affiliated with the franchise

The Golden State Warriors franchise, encompassing its histories as the Philadelphia Warriors (1946–1962) and San Francisco Warriors (1962–1971), has affiliations with 22 players, six coaches, and one executive inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, often for contributions spanning multiple roles such as playing, coaching, or management. These inductees highlight the team's foundational impact on professional basketball, including early scoring pioneers and later defensive stalwarts, with tenures ranging from brief stints to career-defining eras that produced NBA championships in 1947, 1956, 1975, and beyond.

### Players

### Other notable alumni

Baron Davis served as the Warriors' point guard from 2005 to 2008, earning All-NBA Second Team honors in the 2006–07 season after averaging 25.1 points and 8.9 assists per game, and leading the team to its first playoff series victory in 13 years by upsetting the top-seeded Dallas Mavericks in the 2007 playoffs.

Jason Richardson played for the Warriors from 2001 to 2007, winning the NBA Slam Dunk Contest in 2002 and 2003 while averaging 17.1 points per game over that span, and forming a dynamic backcourt duo with Baron Davis during the "We Believe" era.

David Lee played forward for the Warriors from 2010 to 2015, earning All-Star selection in 2013 and 2014 after averaging 18.5 points and 9.3 rebounds per game in 2012–13, providing consistent production during a rebuilding phase before his trade to the Boston Celtics.

Andrew Bogut anchored the center position from 2012 to 2016 after being acquired in the Monta Ellis sign-and-trade, contributing defensively with 1.6 blocks per game in 2014–15 en route to a championship while starting all 67 games he played that season.

## Achievements and records

### NBA championships and Finals appearances

The Golden State Warriors franchise has won seven league championships—four as the Philadelphia Warriors (including one in the Basketball Association of America) and three as the San Francisco/Golden State Warriors—and appeared in twelve NBA Finals series, achieving a 7–5 record in those contests. The early successes came in the league's formative years, with the 1947 BAA title marking the franchise's inaugural crown, followed by the 1956 NBA championship before the team's relocation to California in 1962. After a period of Finals losses in 1964 and 1967, the Warriors claimed their first West Coast-era title in 1975 via a four-game sweep. A 40-year championship drought ensued until the mid-2010s dynasty, led by Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, and later Kevin Durant, which produced five straight Finals berths from 2015 to 2019 and a return in 2022, yielding four additional titles.

| Year | Opponent | Result | Series score | Finals MVP |
|------|----------|--------|--------------|------------|
| 1947 | Chicago Stags | Win | 4–1 | Joe Fulks (Philadelphia Warriors) |
| 1948 | Baltimore Bullets | Loss | 2–4 | — |
| 1956 | Fort Wayne Pistons | Win | 4–1 | Bob Pettit (St. Louis Hawks, opponent; no MVP awarded for Warriors win) |
| 1964 | Boston Celtics | Loss | 1–4 | — |
| 1967 | Philadelphia 76ers | Loss | 2–4 | — |
| 1975 | Washington Bullets | Win | 4–0 | Rick Barry |
| 2015 | Cleveland Cavaliers | Win | 4–2 | Andre Iguodala |
| 2016 | Cleveland Cavaliers | Loss | 3–4 | — |
| 2017 | Cleveland Cavaliers | Win | 4–1 | Kevin Durant |
| 2018 | Cleveland Cavaliers | Win | 4–0 | Kevin Durant |
| 2019 | Toronto Raptors | Loss | 2–4 | — |
| 2022 | Boston Celtics | Win | 4–2 | Stephen Curry |

The 2016 and 2019 defeats highlighted vulnerabilities, including a historic 3–1 comeback loss in 2016 despite a league-record 73 regular-season wins the prior year, and injuries to Durant in 2019. The 2022 triumph, without Durant since 2019, underscored the core trio's enduring impact amid roster turnover.

### Conference and division titles

The Golden State Warriors franchise has won seven Western Conference championships, all as the Western Conference representative after relocating from Philadelphia to the San Francisco Bay Area in 1962. These victories occurred in the 1974–75 season, led by Rick Barry's MVP performance in the Conference Finals against the Chicago Bulls, and during the 2010s dynasty era from 2014–15 through 2018–19, plus the 2021–22 season, propelled by Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green under coach Steve Kerr.

| Season | Opponent in Conference Finals | Result |
|--------|-------------------------------|--------|
| 1974–75 | Chicago Bulls | 4–0 win |
| 2014–15 | Houston Rockets | 4–1 win |
| 2015–16 | Oklahoma City Thunder | 4–3 win |
| 2016–17 | San Antonio Spurs | 4–0 win |
| 2017–18 | Houston Rockets | 4–3 win |
| 2018–19 | Portland Trail Blazers | 4–0 win |
| 2021–22 | Dallas Mavericks | 4–1 win |

The franchise has captured 14 division titles, including three in the Eastern Division as the Philadelphia Warriors (1947–48, 1950–51, 1955–56) and 11 in the Pacific Division following the move west (1963–64, 1966–67, 1974–75, 1975–76, 2014–15 through 2018–19, 2020–21, 2021–22). The 1970s marked early Pacific dominance with consecutive titles in 1975 and 1976 amid consistent playoff contention, while the 2015–19 streak under Kerr tied the NBA record for most consecutive division crowns at the time, reflecting sustained regular-season excellence with records like 67–15 in 2014–15 and 73–9 in 2015–16.

| Division | Years |
|----------|-------|
| Eastern (Philadelphia era) | 1948, 1951, 1956 |
| Pacific (Golden State era) | 1964, 1967, 1975, 1976, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2021, 2022 |

### Individual awards and honors

Warriors franchise players have secured two NBA Most Valuable Player awards, with Wilt Chamberlain earning the honor in 1959–60 during his rookie season with the Philadelphia Warriors. Stephen Curry won the MVP award in 2014–15 and unanimously in 2015–16, becoming the second Warriors player to achieve the feat and the first to win multiple times for the franchise.

The franchise has produced five Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player award winners. Rick Barry received the award in 1975 after leading the Warriors to a championship sweep over the Washington Bullets. Andre Iguodala earned it in 2015 for his defensive impact against LeBron James in the Finals. Kevin Durant captured the honor in both 2017 and 2018 during the Warriors' consecutive championships. Stephen Curry won Finals MVP in 2022, averaging 31.2 points per game in the series victory over the Boston Celtics.

Draymond Green is the only Warriors player to win the NBA Defensive Player of the Year award, receiving it in 2016–17 for his versatile defense that anchored the team's championship run. Green finished third in DPOY voting in 2024–25, behind winner Evan Mobley.

Two Warriors players have won NBA Rookie of the Year: Wilt Chamberlain in 1959–60 and Rick Barry in 1965–66.

| Award Category | Player | Selections (Key Years) |
|----------------|--------|------------------------|
| All-NBA First Team | Rick Barry | 5 (1966, 1967, 1974–76) |
| All-NBA First Team | Wilt Chamberlain | 4 (1960, 1961, 1962, 1964) |
| All-NBA First Team | Stephen Curry | 4 (2015, 2016, 2019, 2021) |
| NBA All-Star | Stephen Curry | 11 (franchise record) |

Curry also holds the franchise record with 11 All-NBA selections as of the 2024–25 season, including a Second Team nod that year.

### Statistical franchise leaders

Stephen Curry holds the Golden State Warriors franchise record for career points, with 25,451, surpassing Wilt Chamberlain's previous mark of 17,783 in April 2021. Curry also leads in assists (6,554), steals (1,553), and games played (1,026), reflecting his longevity and all-around contributions since debuting in 2009.

Nate Thurmond leads in total rebounds with 12,771, accumulated primarily during his tenure from 1963 to 1974, ahead of Chamberlain's 10,768 from his Warriors years (1959–1965). Adonal Foyle holds the blocks record at 1,140, set over 10 seasons from 1997 to 2007, emphasizing his role as a defensive specialist despite limited offensive output.

These records span the franchise's full history, including its Philadelphia Warriors origins, and highlight shifts from dominant big men like Chamberlain and Thurmond to perimeter-oriented stars like Curry, enabled by rule changes and strategic evolutions.

## Playing style and innovations

### Shift to small-ball and pace-and-space offense

Upon hiring Steve Kerr as head coach on May 14, 2014, the Golden State Warriors transitioned from the more conventional offensive schemes under predecessor Mark Jackson to a system emphasizing small-ball lineups and pace-and-space principles. Kerr, drawing from his experience in the triangle offense with the Chicago Bulls and San Antonio Spurs, adapted the approach to leverage the shooting of Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson alongside Draymond Green's defensive versatility, reducing reliance on traditional centers like Andrew Bogut. This shift prioritized quicker, undersized units capable of switching on defense and exploiting mismatches offensively, with Green often playing center in key stretches to enhance mobility and floor balance.

The pace-and-space offense, implemented in the 2014-15 season, accelerated the team's tempo to 98.27 possessions per game while maximizing floor spacing through high-volume three-point attempts and off-ball movement. The Warriors ranked first in scoring at 110.0 points per game, surging from 12th in offensive efficiency the prior year to elite status by incorporating rapid ball reversal, flare screens, and Curry's gravity to create driving lanes and open shots. Small-ball lineups, notably the "Death Lineup" of Curry, Thompson, Andre Iguodala, Harrison Barnes, and Green—first deployed extensively in a December 16, 2014, comeback—posted net ratings exceeding +20 points per 100 possessions in regular-season minutes, enabling seamless transitions and defensive disruption.

This tactical evolution propelled the Warriors to a 67-15 record and the 2015 NBA championship, outscoring opponents by wide margins in small-ball configurations during the playoffs, where the unit demonstrated unmatched versatility against larger frontcourts. The approach's causal effectiveness stemmed from personnel fit—Curry's range pulling defenders outward, Green's passing and help defense compensating for size disadvantages—rather than mere innovation, as evidenced by the team's league-leading fast-break points and assist-to-turnover ratio. Over subsequent seasons, refinements sustained dominance, with the system influencing broader NBA trends toward perimeter-oriented play, though vulnerabilities emerged against physical, paint-dominant teams without corresponding size adjustments.

### Emphasis on three-point shooting and analytics

The Golden State Warriors intensified their focus on three-point shooting upon hiring Steve Kerr as head coach in May 2014, leveraging the skill of Stephen Curry to prioritize high-volume perimeter attempts over traditional inside scoring. Curry, drafted in 2009, emerged as the strategy's linchpin, setting the NBA career record for three-pointers made at 4,032 through the 2022-23 season, with his deep-range accuracy—often from beyond 30 feet—compelling defenses to extend coverage and create driving opportunities. Kerr, who holds the highest career three-point percentage among players with significant volume at 45.4%, explicitly endorsed this shift, stating in October 2024 his intent for the Warriors to operate as a "high volume 3-point shooting team," targeting 6-7 attempts per game from wings like Andrew Wiggins to sustain offensive spacing.

This emphasis yielded measurable results during the team's dynasty era; in the 2015-16 season, the Warriors led the NBA with 31.6 three-point attempts per game, correlating with their franchise-record 73 wins and a league-leading effective field goal percentage that weighted threes heavily. Analytics underscored the rationale, quantifying that a made three-pointer (worth 1.5 points expected value, accounting for misses) outperforms most two-point shots in efficiency, prompting the Warriors to minimize mid-range jumpers in favor of motion offense designed to generate uncontested perimeter looks. By 2016-17, despite ranking fifth in attempts at 31.2 per game, their conversion rate and integration with pace amplified scoring, powering a 67-15 record.

The franchise's analytics infrastructure, expanded since owner Joe Lacob's 2010 acquisition, directly informed this three-point reliance through tools like Google Cloud for processing shot-tracking data from games and practices. Video analytics captured every attempt to evaluate biomechanics, opponent rotations, and lineup synergies that enhance shooting gravity—Curry's presence alone boosting teammates' open-shot frequency by drawing multiple defenders. This data-centric method, predating league-wide adoption, identified three-point volume as a sustainable edge when paired with defensive rebounding to limit second-chance opportunities, distinguishing the Warriors' championships in 2015, 2017, 2018, and 2022 from volume-heavy but less efficient peers. The approach's causal impact lay in exploiting rule-enabled spacing rules and Curry's off-ball movement, which analytics confirmed generated higher-value shots than isolation-heavy alternatives.

### Defensive schemes and versatility

The Golden State Warriors' defensive system, implemented by head coach Steve Kerr since 2014, prioritizes positional versatility and aggressive switching to neutralize pick-and-roll actions and prevent mismatches. This "switch everything" philosophy involves defenders exchanging assignments on nearly all screens, leveraging the team's multi-skilled personnel to maintain coverage across positions rather than relying on drop coverage or hedging that could expose slower big men. The approach, adapted from Kerr's experience with the San Antonio Spurs, enables fluid rotations and disrupts offensive flow by keeping elite shooters like Stephen Curry in containment roles while versatile forwards handle primary ball-handlers.

Central to this scheme is Draymond Green, whose defensive IQ, lateral quickness, and physicality allow him to guard guards, wings, and centers interchangeably, effectively serving as the system's quarterback. Green's versatility—evidenced by his four All-Defensive First Team selections from 2015 to 2019—facilitates small-ball lineups without traditional centers, enabling the Warriors to switch 1-through-5 while generating steals and deflections through help rotations and anticipation. Complementary defenders like Andre Iguodala and Klay Thompson provided perimeter lockdown and chase-down ability, contributing to elite team defense in title runs; for instance, during the 2016-17 season, the Warriors posted the league's best defensive rating of 101.4 points allowed per 100 possessions, correlating with their NBA championship win.

The system's adaptability extends beyond man-to-man switching, incorporating zone defenses and targeted traps to exploit opponent tendencies, such as early-game hedging against isolation-heavy teams. This scheme versatility allowed the Warriors to rank top-5 in defensive efficiency multiple times, including first overall in 2015-16 (104.2 rating) amid their record 73 wins, though it demands high conditioning and communication to mitigate vulnerabilities against oversized lineups. In recent iterations, Kerr has emphasized staying in front of the ball and deflection metrics, with the 2024-25 team ranking second in deflections early in the season, underscoring the enduring emphasis on active, positionless defense over static schemes.

## Rivalries

### Cleveland Cavaliers

The rivalry between the Golden State Warriors and Cleveland Cavaliers intensified during the mid-2010s, primarily due to four consecutive NBA Finals matchups from 2015 to 2018, pitting LeBron James-led Cavaliers against the Warriors' core of Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green. Prior to this period, the teams had met regularly since both joined the NBA in 1970, with the Warriors holding a historical regular-season edge of 68 wins to Cleveland's 56 as of recent records. The Finals clashes elevated the competition into one of the league's most storied, characterized by high-stakes drama, individual duels, and strategic battles, though it subsided after James departed Cleveland in 2018.

In the 2015 NBA Finals, the Warriors defeated the Cavaliers 4–2, securing their first championship in 40 years with Andre Iguodala earning Finals MVP honors after averaging 16.3 points, 5.8 rebounds, and 4.0 assists per game while defending James. Cleveland, hampered by injuries to Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love, relied heavily on James, who posted 35.8 points, 13.3 rebounds, and 8.8 assists per game across the series. The Warriors' victory was sealed in Game 6 on June 16, 2015, with a 105–97 win in Cleveland, highlighted by Curry's 25 points and Iguodala's defensive impact.

The 2016 Finals saw Cleveland stage the first comeback from a 3–1 deficit in NBA Finals history, winning 4–3 despite Draymond Green's one-game suspension for accumulating technical fouls, which altered Game 5 dynamics. James averaged 29.7 points, 11.3 rebounds, and 8.9 assists, culminating in a chasedown block on Iguodala in Game 7 on June 19, 2016, followed by Irving's go-ahead three-pointer over Curry, securing a 93–89 victory and Cleveland's first-ever title. Notable tension arose from on-court incidents, including James stepping over Green in Game 4, which led to Green's retaliatory kick and subsequent scrutiny.

Subsequent series favored Golden State: the 2017 Finals ended 4–1 after the Warriors added Kevin Durant, who averaged 35.2 points per game en route to Finals MVP, overpowering Cleveland's defense. In 2018, Golden State swept 4–0, with Curry scoring 37 points in Game 4 on June 8, 2018, to clinch their third title in four years. These matchups underscored contrasts in playing styles—Golden State's pace-and-space offense against Cleveland's reliance on James' versatility—but the rivalry's peak intensity waned post-2018 with roster changes and James' move to the Lakers, reducing playoff encounters while regular-season games remain competitive.

### Los Angeles Lakers

The rivalry between the Golden State Warriors and the Los Angeles Lakers, two of the NBA's most storied franchises, stems from their competition for dominance in the Western Conference and their shared California roots since the Warriors relocated to the Bay Area in 1962 and the Lakers to Los Angeles in 1960. The Lakers hold a commanding all-time edge, with 265 regular-season victories to the Warriors' 178 as of the 2024-25 season, reflecting periods of Lakers supremacy during dynasties led by figures like Wilt Chamberlain, Magic Johnson, and Kobe Bryant. In playoff matchups, the disparity is even starker, with the Lakers winning 28 of 41 games across eight series, underscoring their historical postseason success against the Warriors.

Early encounters highlighted the Lakers' edge in the 1970s and 1980s, including a 4-2 Lakers victory in the 1973 Western Division Finals, where Jerry West and Chamberlain outdueled Rick Barry's Warriors. A notable upset occurred in the 1987 Western Conference Semifinals, when the Warriors, powered by Sleepy Floyd's 51-point game in Game 4, swept the Lakers 3-0, ending a dominant Lakers era under Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. These clashes often featured high-stakes battles for divisional titles, with both teams combining for 38 Pacific Division championships since the 1960s, fueling regional tensions between Northern and Southern California fanbases.

The rivalry reignited in the 2010s amid the Warriors' ascent to dynasty status, contrasting with the Lakers' post-Kobe struggles, leading to lopsided regular-season results favoring Golden State during Stephen Curry's prime. However, playoff intensity peaked in the 2023 Western Conference Semifinals, where the seventh-seeded Lakers, led by LeBron James' 26.3 points per game and Anthony Davis' defensive anchoring, defeated the sixth-seeded Warriors 4-2, advancing despite Golden State's home-court advantage and Curry's 29.4 points per game average. This series exemplified the matchup's physicality and strategic depth, with Draymond Green's flagrant foul on James in Game 1 drawing league scrutiny and highlighting ongoing debates over officiating in high-profile California derbies.

Beyond statistics, the rivalry embodies contrasts in franchise philosophies—Lakers' star-driven legacy versus Warriors' team-oriented, analytics-fueled revolution—driving media narratives and fan rivalries amplified by proximity and cultural divides between the Bay Area's tech ethos and Los Angeles' entertainment glamour. Regular-season games remain marquee events, often influencing playoff seeding, as seen in the Warriors' 119-109 victory over the Lakers on October 22, 2024, in the season opener, where Curry's shooting prowess tested the Lakers' revamped defense. Despite the Lakers' historical lead, the Warriors' four titles from 2015 to 2022 have narrowed the perceived gap, positioning future clashes as tests of enduring relevance in the NBA's premier intrastate feud.

### Sacramento Kings

The rivalry between the Golden State Warriors and Sacramento Kings originates from their shared location in Northern California, with the teams approximately 88 miles apart, fostering competition for regional fan support and media attention since the Kings relocated to Sacramento from Kansas City in 1985. Both franchises have experienced periods of competitive balance, contributing to a head-to-head regular-season record of 219 wins for the Warriors against 197 for the Kings as of the 2023-24 season. The intensity has fluctuated, with early matchups in the 1980s and 1990s marked by divisional play in the Pacific Division, but it escalated in the 2010s amid the Warriors' rise to contention and the Kings' struggles, leading to lopsided outcomes favoring Golden State.

Playoff encounters have been rare but pivotal, with the teams meeting only seven times in postseason history, the Warriors holding a 4-3 edge overall. Their most recent and defining clash occurred in the 2023 Western Conference First Round, where the sixth-seeded Warriors upset the third-seeded Kings in seven games, advancing despite trailing 2-0 early. Stephen Curry's 50-point performance in Game 7 on April 30, 2023—the highest scoring output in any NBA Game 7—proved decisive, as Golden State rallied from a halftime deficit to win 120-100 at home. The series featured contentious moments, including Draymond Green's flagrant foul for stepping on Domantas Sabonis's ankle in Game 1, which drew scrutiny for potential intent amid Green's history of physical play, though officials upheld the call on review. Kings fans and management, led by owner Vivek Ranadive, alleged officiating biases favoring the Warriors, citing 37 free-throw attempts for Golden State versus 20 for Sacramento in Game 7, but NBA reviews found no irregularities beyond standard variability in high-stakes games.

Beyond 2023, notable regular-season highlights underscore the matchup's competitiveness, such as Klay Thompson's 60-point outburst against Sacramento on December 5, 2016, during the Warriors' record 73-win season, where he shot 21-of-38 from the field without a turnover. Curry's no-look three-pointer in a 2015 win further symbolized Golden State's flair, contributing to a period where the Warriors dominated, winning 14 of 16 games from 2014 to 2019. The rivalry's edge persists due to stylistic contrasts—Sacramento's up-tempo offense led by De'Aaron Fox clashing with Golden State's spacing and defense—exacerbated by interpersonal tensions, including Green's vocal criticisms of Kings players and the franchise's 17-year playoff drought ending in 2023 only to falter against the Warriors. Despite Warriors' historical advantage, Sacramento's youth and home-court energy have occasionally flipped outcomes, as in their 118-99 Game 6 rout in 2023, keeping the intrastate feud alive amid California's divided basketball loyalties.

### Other notable rivalries

The Golden State Warriors have developed several intense rivalries beyond their divisional and historical foes, primarily through repeated high-stakes playoff clashes during their 2010s dynasty period. These matchups against the Los Angeles Clippers, San Antonio Spurs, Houston Rockets, and Oklahoma City Thunder featured dramatic comebacks, controversial incidents, and stylistic contrasts between the Warriors' pace-and-space offense and opponents' defensive schemes or isolation-heavy attacks.

The Warriors-Clippers rivalry intensified in the mid-2010s amid the Clippers' "Lob City" era led by Chris Paul, Blake Griffin, and DeAndre Jordan clashing with Golden State's emerging core. The teams met in the playoffs twice, with the Warriors holding a 7-6 edge in 13 games, including a 4-2 first-round victory in 2014 where Stephen Curry averaged 24.0 points and dished 6.8 assists per game to overcome the Clippers' physicality. Regular-season encounters often produced thriller finishes, such as the Clippers' 112-104 win on April 13, 2025, amid ongoing Western Conference contention, contributing to perceptions of it as one of the league's premier rivalries due to shared California roots and contrasting fanbases despite the geographic distance.

Against the Spurs, the Warriors faced Gregg Popovich's disciplined system in four playoff series from 2013 to 2018, prevailing in three with an overall 13-6 game record. The 2013 Western Conference Finals saw Golden State upset San Antonio 4-2, advancing to the NBA Finals for the first time since 1975 behind Curry's 22.6 points per game. Tensions peaked in 2017's Western Conference Finals, where the Warriors swept 4-0 following a controversial Game 1 play by Zaza Pachulia on Kawhi Leonard, leading to Leonard's ankle injury and San Antonio's limited competitiveness thereafter; the Spurs managed just 18 points in the fourth quarter across the final three games. A 2018 first-round rematch ended 4-1 for Golden State, underscoring the rivalry's evolution from mutual respect to playoff dominance.

The Warriors-Rockets matchup became a hallmark of the dynasty era, with Houston's James Harden-led isolation offense challenging Golden State's motion principles in four consecutive postseason series from 2015 to 2019, all won by the Warriors (4-0 in series outcomes). In the 2015 Western Conference Finals, Golden State triumphed 4-1 after trailing 2-1, sparked by Curry's 34-point Game 4 explosion. The 2018 Western Conference Finals epitomized the bitterness, as the Warriors rallied from a 3-1 deficit to win 4-3 despite Chris Paul's hamstring injury in Game 5, with Draymond Green's triple-double in Game 7 (10 points, 13 rebounds, 10 assists) sealing the series amid debates over Houston's 27 three-point makes in the clincher. The 2019 semifinals went 4-2 for Golden State, hampered by Kevin Durant's calf injury, highlighting the rivalry's toll on player health and roster sustainability.

The 2016 Western Conference Finals against the Thunder marked a defining moment, with Oklahoma City's Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant pushing the 73-win Warriors to the brink before Golden State staged a 4-3 comeback from a 3-1 hole. Klay Thompson's franchise-record 11 three-pointers for 41 points in Game 6 forced a decisive seventh game, which the Warriors won 96-88 behind Curry's 36 points and Thompson's 11, overcoming OKC's athleticism and rebounding edge (45-34 series average). This series, featuring ejections and technical fouls, fueled narratives of resilience but also foreshadowed Durant's free-agency move to Golden State the following offseason.

## Controversies and criticisms

### Player conduct and on-court incidents

Draymond Green has faced multiple NBA suspensions for on-court altercations, highlighting a pattern of physical confrontations during games. On November 14, 2023, Green was suspended for five games after grabbing Minnesota Timberwolves center Rudy Gobert around the neck during a skirmish in a game against the Timberwolves. Earlier that year, on April 9, 2023, he received a one-game suspension for stomping on Sacramento Kings center Domantas Sabonis's leg following a rebound battle in a playoff game. In December 2023, Green was indefinitely suspended after striking Phoenix Suns center Jusuf Nurkic in the face, missing 12 games before returning.

Green's history includes earlier incidents, such as a one-game suspension for the 2016 NBA Finals Game 5 after repeatedly striking Cleveland Cavaliers forward LeBron James in the groin during Game 4. He was fined $25,000 but not suspended for kicking Oklahoma City Thunder center Steven Adams in the groin during the 2016 Western Conference Finals. These events contributed to six career suspensions for Green, alongside over 200 technical fouls and fines totaling millions in lost pay.

Off-court but team-related conduct issues include Green's October 2022 punch to teammate Jordan Poole's face during a preseason practice, captured on leaked video and sparking internal discord that factored into Poole's trade to the Washington Wizards. Green later described the incident as a major leadership failure, apologizing publicly multiple times while noting Poole's provocative shove preceded it.

Other Warriors players have been involved in isolated on-court ejections. On October 15, 2025, forward Jonathan Kuminga was ejected and fined $35,000 for inappropriate contact with referee Rodney Mott after disputing a missed call in a preseason game against the Portland Trail Blazers. In April 2025, reserve guard Pat Spencer was ejected for headbutting Houston Rockets center Alperen Şengün during a playoff scuffle in Game 5. These incidents, while less frequent than Green's, underscore occasional lapses in player restraint amid competitive play.

### Roster construction and superteam accusations

The Golden State Warriors assembled their championship roster primarily through strategic draft selections in the early 2010s. In the 2009 NBA Draft, the team selected guard Stephen Curry with the 7th overall pick after trading up from the 14th position. Curry, who had averaged 25.9 points per game as a junior at Davidson College, quickly emerged as a franchise cornerstone despite initial injury concerns. The Warriors followed with the 11th overall selection of Klay Thompson in 2011, a sharpshooting guard from Washington State who complemented Curry's scoring with elite perimeter defense. In 2012, they drafted forward Harrison Barnes 7th overall and power forward Draymond Green 35th overall in the second round; Green's versatile defense and playmaking proved invaluable despite his late-round status. These picks formed the nucleus of a homegrown core, supplemented by the 2013 free-agent signing of Andre Iguodala, whose defensive versatility earned him Finals MVP honors in 2015.

This foundation enabled the Warriors to capture their first NBA title in 40 years in 2015, defeating the Cleveland Cavaliers 4-2 in the Finals, with Curry earning unanimous MVP. The team's success continued into the 2015-16 season, where they set an NBA record with 73 regular-season wins, though they fell to the Cavaliers in the Finals after leading 3-1. Following this loss, forward Kevin Durant, the 2013-14 MVP and a free agent after seven seasons with the Oklahoma City Thunder, signed a two-year, $54.3 million contract with Golden State on July 4, 2016. The move was facilitated by a league-wide salary cap increase of over 10% due to new television revenue, which aligned with the extension-friendly deals of Curry, Thompson, and Green, creating the necessary cap space.

Durant's addition to a roster already featuring three All-NBA caliber players drew widespread accusations of superteam formation, with critics arguing it undermined competitive balance by concentrating elite talent. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver voiced concerns on July 12, 2016, stating the signing highlighted flaws in the collective bargaining agreement that enabled such aggregations, prompting discussions on future rule changes like luxury tax aprons. Pundits and fans, including those on platforms like Twitter, labeled it an "easy road" to titles, contrasting it with traditional roster builds via drafts or trades rather than free agency to a proven contender. However, proponents countered that the Warriors' core was drafted and developed internally, with Durant's decision reflecting player agency under existing rules; historical precedents like the Boston Celtics' 1950s-60s dynasty or the Miami Heat's 2010 LeBron James signing involved similar talent concentrations without equivalent backlash. Empirically, the augmented lineup won championships in 2017 and 2018, averaging 67 wins per regular season from 2016-19, validating the construction's effectiveness while fueling debates on league parity.

### Management decisions and internal conflicts

The departure of longtime president and general manager Bob Myers in May 2023 marked a significant transition in Warriors management, following four championships and 12 years of tenure. Myers cited a desire for more family time and relief from the intense demands of the role, stating he could no longer commit fully to the position amid ongoing high-stakes decisions.  Speculation among observers suggested underlying factors, including fatigue from navigating veteran player extensions like Klay Thompson's and potential directives to prioritize established stars over younger talent, though Myers emphasized personal burnout over organizational discord.

A pivotal management decision arose from the October 2022 preseason incident where Draymond Green punched teammate Jordan Poole, fracturing team chemistry and prompting internal reevaluation. Ownership and front office, under co-executive chairman Joe Lacob and interim leadership, opted to extend the veteran core's influence, suspending Poole and ultimately trading him to the Washington Wizards on July 6, 2023, for Chris Paul along with draft picks. This move, executed shortly after Poole's four-year, $128 million extension, prioritized restoring cohesion among Stephen Curry, Thompson, and Green—core to the dynasty—over retaining the 23-year-old guard's upside, despite his 20.4 points per game average in the prior playoffs. Critics, including Charles Barkley, interpreted the trade as evidence of deep-seated animosity toward Poole, arguing it sacrificed long-term flexibility for short-term harmony, with subsequent developments—Paul's release in 2024 and Poole's resale value—amplifying perceptions of mismanagement. New GM Mike Dunleavy Jr. later defended the acquisition as necessary for contention, though it underscored tensions between loyalty to aging stars and youth development.

Contract negotiations with Klay Thompson further highlighted internal frictions, culminating in his free-agency departure to the Dallas Mavericks on July 3, 2024, via a three-year, $50 million deal. The Warriors had extended a two-year, $48 million offer, which Thompson's camp viewed as disrespectful given his dynasty contributions, leading to stalled talks influenced directly by Lacob's hands-on approach described as "cold."  Thompson's final counterproposal of two years at approximately $40 million was rejected, reflecting broader ownership calculus balancing payroll taxes against a declining shooter's output (17.9 points per game in 2023-24). This acrimonious split, after 13 seasons and four titles, exposed rifts in valuing legacy versus fiscal prudence, with Lacob later claiming competitive offers were made but acknowledging emotional strains.

Ongoing disputes with emerging talents like Jonathan Kuminga illustrated persistent front-office challenges into 2025, as extension talks stalled amid blunt exchanges with Lacob over role and compensation. Kuminga expressed frustration at limited minutes despite strong play (16.1 points per game in 2023-24), leading to a perceived holdout mentality that Dunleavy attributed to mismatched expectations rather than malice. These dynamics, compounded by earlier draft missteps like the 2020 selection of James Wiseman—defended by Lacob but widely critiqued for poor fit—revealed a management pattern favoring win-now aggression under high luxury-tax burdens, often at the expense of harmonious youth integration. Internal restructuring, including Kent Lacob's August 2025 resignation as vice president of basketball development, signaled further adjustments amid roster flux.

### Broader franchise criticisms

The Golden State Warriors' relocation from Oakland's Oracle Arena to the Chase Center in San Francisco, completed prior to the 2019–20 NBA season, elicited widespread criticism for perceived abandonment of a loyal fanbase that had supported the franchise through decades of mediocrity prior to its mid-2010s resurgence. Oakland residents and former supporters argued that the move prioritized revenue-generating amenities in a wealthier market over historical ties, exacerbating gentrification and eroding the city's sports identity, especially as it preceded the departure of the Oakland Raiders to Las Vegas. The franchise's introduction of an "Oakland Forever" alternate jersey in 2020 was dismissed by some as an insincere gesture amid the transition, failing to mitigate sentiments of betrayal.

Ownership under Joe Lacob, who acquired the team in 2010 for $450 million alongside Peter Guber, has faced accusations of fostering an arrogant organizational culture, particularly after the franchise's four championships between 2015 and 2022. Critics contend Lacob's hands-on approach undermines front-office autonomy, with reports highlighting his direct interference in personnel decisions and roster strategies. Lacob's public dismissals of rival teams' trade proposals as "illogical" and complaints about the NBA's luxury tax—despite the group's $448 million in profits since 2016—have amplified perceptions of entitlement, contrasting with the franchise's earlier underdog narrative. Such rhetoric, including Lacob's pre-ownership prediction of a championship within five years (achieved in four), has been characterized by detractors as hubristic, potentially alienating broader NBA stakeholders.

## Media and broadcasting

### Television and streaming coverage

The Golden State Warriors' games are primarily broadcast locally on NBC Sports Bay Area, which holds the regional television rights and airs the majority of non-nationally televised regular-season contests, preseason games, and select playoff matchups if the team advances. This arrangement stems from a long-term deal extended through at least the 2029-30 season, ensuring comprehensive coverage for viewers in the Bay Area and surrounding regions including central California, southern Oregon, and northern Nevada. Access to NBC Sports Bay Area requires a subscription through cable providers or streaming services such as DirecTV Stream, FuboTV, Hulu + Live TV, YouTube TV, or as an add-on to Peacock.

Nationally, the Warriors are featured extensively under the NBA's new 11-year media rights agreement effective for the 2025-26 season, which distributes games across Disney (ABC and ESPN), NBCUniversal (NBC and Peacock), and Amazon Prime Video. The team set a franchise record with 34 nationally televised regular-season games, including six on ABC, seven on ESPN, seven on NBC, and additional appearances on TNT and NBA TV. For instance, the season-opening game against the Los Angeles Lakers on October 22, 2025, was initially demoted to Peacock streaming by NBC before broader availability. Eight Warriors games air on NBA TV, which simulcasts select national broadcasts and provides analysis, also available locally on NBC Sports Bay Area.

Streaming options complement traditional broadcasts, with NBA League Pass offering out-of-market access to live and on-demand games excluding local and national blackouts, available directly via NBA.com or integrated with Amazon Prime Video, priced at $159.99 for the season with multi-device support. National games stream on ESPN+, Peacock for NBC broadcasts, and Prime Video, while local Warriors content requires NBCSBA authentication through compatible apps or services. Blackout restrictions apply based on viewer location, prioritizing local revenue streams over unrestricted national access.

### Radio broadcasts

The Golden State Warriors' radio broadcasts are primarily carried on 95.7 The Game (KGMZ-FM), the team's flagship station since 2016, following the end of a long-term partnership with KNBR 680. In September 2025, the Warriors extended their agreement with Audacy-owned 95.7 The Game, which includes coverage of all regular-season and playoff games, along with 30-minute pregame and postgame shows hosted by Marc Grandi and Evan Giddings. The station's programming features expanded daily Warriors content, such as analysis segments with former player Tom Tolbert.

Tim Roye has served as the play-by-play announcer since the 1995-96 season, marking his 31st year with the team as of the 2025-26 season, during which he has called every playoff buzzer-beater and championship moment, including the franchise's four titles since 2015. The Warriors Radio Network extends beyond the flagship to affiliate stations across Northern California, from Eureka southward, ensuring broader regional access to live game audio.

Prior to the shift to 95.7 The Game, the Warriors' games aired on KNBR for decades, a move prompted by the team's rising popularity amid their championship era, which necessitated a dedicated sports frequency for enhanced coverage. This transition aligned with the franchise's relocation to San Francisco and the subsequent surge in listenership, though specific earlier broadcast details from the pre-1995 era remain less documented in public records.

### Print and digital media

The *San Francisco Chronicle* has provided extensive print coverage of the Golden State Warriors since the team's relocation to the Bay Area in 1971, featuring game reports, player profiles, and championship specials in its Sporting Green section. The newspaper produced commemorative front-page prints for key milestones, such as the Warriors' 73-win 2015–16 regular season and their 2022 NBA Finals victory.  Sam Gordon has served as the Chronicle's primary Warriors beat reporter since January 2024, delivering in-depth analysis on roster moves, injuries, and performance.

The *Mercury News*, based in the East Bay with historical ties to the Warriors' Oakland era, offers regular print and online reporting on team news, schedules, and scores through its sports section. National print outlets like *Sports Illustrated* have featured Warriors content on multiple covers, particularly during dynasty years, highlighting players such as Stephen Curry and team achievements.

In digital media, the Warriors' official NBA.com portal disseminates press releases, game recaps, and multimedia features, including practice insights and media day coverage updated as of the 2025–26 preseason. Local digital extensions of print sources, such as SFChronicle.com and SFGATE.com, provide real-time updates, injury reports, and columns mirroring and expanding print content.  Independent digital platforms like Golden State of Mind offer fan-oriented analysis, rumors, and stats, drawing millions of monthly visits during seasons. Broader national digital coverage appears on sites including Bleacher Report for highlights and expert breakdowns, and CBS Sports for scores and roster data.
