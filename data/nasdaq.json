  "content": "# Nasdaq\n\nThe Nasdaq Stock Market is an electronic stock exchange based in New York City, founded in 1971 by the National Association of Securities Dealers as the world's first automated trading system, originally standing for National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations. It specializes in listing growth-oriented companies, particularly in technology, biotechnology, and other innovative sectors, providing liquidity, transparency, and resiliency to U.S. equities markets through fully electronic trading without a physical trading floor.  \n\nOperated by Nasdaq, Inc., the exchange lists over 3,000 companies and supports trading in stocks, exchange-traded products, and derivatives, with the Nasdaq Composite Index serving as a broad market benchmark tracking all domestic and international common stocks listed on the platform. The Nasdaq-100 Index, comprising 100 of the largest non-financial companies, highlights its focus on high-growth firms and has become a global symbol of technological innovation and market performance. Its pioneering electronic model revolutionized securities trading by enabling real-time quotes and decentralized market-making, expanding access beyond traditional floor-based exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange.  \n\nNasdaq's defining achievements include fostering the growth of the tech sector during the 1990s internet boom and maintaining leadership in market technology amid expansions into data services and international operations, though it has faced scrutiny over trading halts and system glitches, such as during high-profile initial public offerings. The exchange's emphasis on innovation has positioned it as a key driver of capital formation for emerging industries, with ongoing adaptations to regulatory changes and technological advancements ensuring its role in modern financial markets.\n\n## History\n\n### Founding and Early Operations (1971–1990)\n\nThe Nasdaq Stock Market, originally known as the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (NASDAQ), was created by the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) to provide an electronic quotation system for over-the-counter (OTC) securities. It commenced trading operations on February 8, 1971, marking the launch of the world's first fully electronic stock exchange without a physical trading floor.  The system initially listed around 3,000 OTC securities and disseminated real-time bid and ask quotes to approximately 500 market makers through dedicated computer terminals connected nationwide.  This automated approach contrasted with manual quote dissemination on \"pink sheets,\" enabling faster access to pricing data and laying the groundwork for decentralized electronic trading.\n\nIn its first year, Nasdaq supported trading volume of nearly 2 billion shares across these market makers, demonstrating early adoption despite the prevailing dominance of floor-based exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange. The Nasdaq Composite Index, introduced with a base value of 100 shortly before trading began, experienced modest appreciation amid broader market volatility in the early 1970s, reflecting initial focus on smaller, growth-oriented firms rather than blue-chip stocks. By the end of the decade, the index had risen to 151.14, a net gain of 51% from inception, though this trailed inflation-adjusted benchmarks due to economic challenges like the 1973–1974 recession.\n\nNasdaq's early operations emphasized technological innovation to compete with established exchanges, attracting initial public offerings from technology pioneers such as Intel in 1971. Listings grew steadily through the 1970s as the platform's efficiency drew smaller and mid-cap companies seeking lower listing costs and broader market maker participation. A key milestone came in 1982 with the introduction of the Nasdaq National Market System (NMS), which launched on April 1 with 40 qualifying securities meeting stricter financial reporting and liquidity standards to enhance investor protections and market depth. This tiered structure, expanded in subsequent years, improved transparency by requiring real-time trade reporting and last-sale data, helping Nasdaq evolve from a quotation service into a more robust trading venue. By 1983, the Composite Index crossed 300 for the first time, signaling accelerating momentum amid deregulatory trends and rising interest in tech stocks.\n\n### Growth Amid Deregulation and Tech Boom (1990–2000)\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite Index experienced substantial growth during the 1990s, rising from a closing value of 373.84 at the end of 1990 to a peak of 5,048.62 on March 10, 2000, driven by increasing investor enthusiasm for technology stocks.  This surge reflected the exchange's alignment with emerging sectors like computing and telecommunications, where market capitalization-weighted indexing amplified gains from high-growth listings. Trading activity expanded dramatically, with the dollar value of stocks traded on Nasdaq increasing from 11% of New York Stock Exchange volume in 1990 to 81% by December 1999, underscoring Nasdaq's emergence as a dominant venue for equities.\n\nRegulatory reforms addressed longstanding criticisms of Nasdaq's dealer-driven model, particularly wide bid-ask spreads and opaque quoting practices exploited by small-order day traders via the Small Order Execution System (SOES). In 1997, the SEC's Order Handling Rules (OHR) required market makers to display customer limit orders improving the national best bid or offer and permitted direct access to electronic communication networks (ECNs), fostering greater transparency and competition.  These changes, effective for all Nasdaq stocks by October 1997, narrowed quoted spreads, boosted the number of trade executions, and reduced average trade sizes, while a concurrent tick-size reduction from 1/8 to 1/16 of a dollar further compressed costs for investors. Reforms also included SOES adjustments to curb rapid order flooding by traders, approved by the SEC amid legal challenges from day-trading firms.\n\nThe decade's tech boom, fueled by internet commercialization and low interest rates during the post-World War II longest U.S. economic expansion, propelled speculative investments in dot-com firms, many of which chose Nasdaq for its flexible listing standards suited to unprofitable growth companies.  This period saw heightened volatility and valuations, with the index quintupling from 1995 to 2000 amid adoption of web technologies, though underlying profitability often lagged exuberant pricing. Nasdaq's electronic platform innovations, such as the 1990 introduction of SelectNet for negotiated large trades, supported this scalability without physical trading floors.\n\n### Post-Bubble Reforms and Public Listing (2001–2010)\n\nFollowing the collapse of the dot-com bubble, the Nasdaq Composite Index plummeted 78% from its all-time high of 5,048.62 on March 10, 2000, to a trough of 1,114.11 on October 9, 2002, amid widespread failures of overvalued technology firms and eroded investor confidence. This downturn prompted intensified scrutiny of Nasdaq's dealer-driven market structure, which had facilitated wide bid-ask spreads and potential manipulations exposed in prior SEC investigations. To address these issues and align with broader market modernization, Nasdaq completed decimalization on April 9, 2001, shifting all equity quotes and trades from fractional increments (e.g., 1/16th of a dollar) to decimal pennies, which halved average spreads from about 6.25 cents to 3 cents initially and boosted quoted depth and trading volume by over 50% in the following months.\n\nRegulatory reforms accelerated Nasdaq's structural evolution away from its origins as a subsidiary of the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD). Demutualization efforts, initiated with NASD member approval in April 2000, separated Nasdaq's for-profit market operations from NASD's regulatory oversight to mitigate conflicts of interest and enable competitive financing. The SEC approved Nasdaq's registration as a national securities exchange on January 13, 2006, allowing it to operate independently as The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC. Full operational separation from NASD occurred on August 1, 2006, for Nasdaq-listed securities, with expansion to other exchange-listed issues by October 1, 2006; this shift enhanced Nasdaq's self-regulatory capabilities while contracting NASD (later FINRA) for certain surveillance functions at a cost of over $70 million annually. Concurrently, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 imposed rigorous corporate governance mandates on listed companies, including majority-independent boards and fully independent audit committees, which Nasdaq incorporated into its listing standards to restore transparency and deter accounting frauds that had proliferated during the bubble.\n\nNasdaq's transformation culminated in its public listing as a for-profit corporation. In 2005, following demutualization, Nasdaq executed an initial public offering (IPO) of its shares under the ticker NDAQ, marking its conversion from industry-owned entity to a publicly traded company and enabling access to capital markets for expansion. This move, completed amid the implementation of Regulation NMS in 2005—which promoted fairer order execution and intermarket competition—positioned Nasdaq to challenge the New York Stock Exchange's dominance by fostering electronic trading innovations and attracting international listings. By 2010, these reforms had stabilized Nasdaq's operations, with annual trading volume exceeding 1 trillion shares and a diversified revenue base less reliant on listing fees.\n\n### Acquisitions, Expansion, and Recent Resilience (2011–2025)\n\nIn 2012, Nasdaq acquired the investor relations solutions, shareholder services, and public company solutions businesses from Thomson Reuters for $390 million, diversifying its revenue beyond core exchange operations into corporate client services. This move supported expansion in data and analytics offerings for public companies. In 2016, Nasdaq completed the acquisition of the International Securities Exchange (ISE), an electronic options trading platform, enhancing its derivatives market capabilities and client efficiencies.\n\nNasdaq continued aggressive growth in financial technology through subsequent deals. In September 2017, it purchased eVestment, a leading provider of institutional investment data and analytics used by asset managers and consultants, for $705 million in cash, bolstering its global information services segment. The 2023 acquisition of Adenza for $10.5 billion—comprising $5.75 billion in cash and 85.6 million shares of Nasdaq stock—represented the company's largest transaction, integrating Verafin's anti-financial crime detection, Calypso's trading and risk management, and AxiomSL's regulatory reporting tools to target banks and brokers. These acquisitions shifted Nasdaq toward a SaaS-heavy model, with financial technology comprising a growing share of revenue.\n\nInternational expansion leveraged Nasdaq's existing Nordic and Baltic operations, integrated post-2008 OMX purchase, by enhancing cross-border trading and listings. By 2025, Nasdaq Nordic and Baltic exchanges supported over 1,100 listed companies across Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, and the Baltic states, unified under a single trading system for seamless membership. The company introduced 18 new international index products in Q3 2025 alone, expanding data accessibility for global investors.\n\nNasdaq demonstrated operational and financial resilience amid market disruptions. Following the May 2012 Facebook IPO technical failures, which caused trading halts and a subsequent $10 million SEC penalty in 2013 for inadequate systems, Nasdaq invested heavily in platform upgrades, reducing outage risks. During the 2020 COVID-19 volatility, its electronic infrastructure handled record volumes without major failures, contributing to sustained growth. Revenue rose from $3.44 billion in 2011 to $7.40 billion in 2024 and a trailing twelve-month figure of $8.17 billion as of September 2025, driven by diversified non-trading segments amid tech sector booms and interest rate pressures. In Q3 2025, solutions revenue exceeded $1 billion quarterly for the first time, underscoring stability from recurring SaaS contracts despite broader economic headwinds like inflation and geopolitical tensions.\n\n## Organizational and Governance Structure\n\n### Ownership, Leadership, and Key Milestones\n\nNasdaq, Inc. operates as a publicly traded corporation listed on its own exchange under the ticker symbol NDAQ, following its initial public offering on November 13, 2002, which raised approximately $139 million and marked its transition from a subsidiary of the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) to an independent for-profit entity. As of the most recent filings, institutional investors hold about 86% of outstanding shares, with no single entity controlling a majority; prominent holders include Investor AB with 10.19% (58,182,426 shares), The Vanguard Group with roughly 10%, Wellington Management Group with 7.22%, and BlackRock with significant stakes.  This diffuse ownership structure reflects broad market participation, though high institutional concentration can influence governance through voting power on shareholder proposals.\n\nLeadership is headed by Adena T. Friedman, who assumed the role of President and Chief Executive Officer on January 1, 2017, after serving in various senior capacities including as a board member and head of corporate client group, and was elevated to Chair of the Board on January 1, 2023.  Key supporting executives include Tal Cohen as President of Market Platforms, overseeing trading operations, and Sarah Youngwood as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, managing financial strategy and reporting. Friedman's tenure has emphasized technological integration and expansion into data analytics, building on her prior experience at Nasdaq from 1993 onward and at Carlyle Group. The board comprises independent directors with expertise in finance and technology, ensuring oversight aligned with shareholder interests.\n\nSignificant milestones in ownership and leadership include the demutualization process initiated in summer 1999, when Nasdaq announced plans to convert from a member-owned association under NASD to a for-profit structure to enhance competitiveness and capital access. NASD members approved this in April 2000 via a two-step restructuring, separating Nasdaq's exchange operations from NASD's regulatory functions. Demutualization finalized in 2001, positioning Nasdaq as a standalone subsidiary before its 2002 IPO, which distributed shares to NASD while retaining some NASD interest initially. Subsequent leadership shifts, such as Bob Greifeld's CEO tenure from 2003 to 2016 focusing on acquisitions like OMX AB in 2008, preceded Friedman's appointment amid post-financial crisis reforms. In 2023, Friedman's dual chair-CEO role consolidated authority, coinciding with strategic pivots toward AI-driven market tools. These developments underscore Nasdaq's evolution from a dealer-owned network to a diversified, shareholder-driven enterprise.\n\n### Regulatory Oversight and Compliance Evolution\n\nThe Nasdaq Stock Market, established in 1971 as an automated quotation system by the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD), initially operated under the NASD's self-regulatory framework, with oversight from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This structure positioned the NASD as the primary self-regulatory organization (SRO) responsible for enforcing trading rules, market surveillance, and member compliance, while the SEC retained ultimate authority to approve rules, examine operations, and intervene in enforcement. Early challenges, including a 1996 SEC investigation into Nasdaq dealer bid-ask spreads that revealed potential collusion, prompted reforms such as the 1997 Order Handling Rules, which mandated limit order display and access to improve price competition and transparency.\n\nAs Nasdaq pursued demutualization and for-profit status in the early 2000s, tensions arose over the integration of commercial interests with regulatory duties under the NASD umbrella, leading to efforts to separate functions and mitigate conflicts. In 2005, Nasdaq filed to register as a national securities exchange, culminating in SEC approval that enabled full operational independence effective August 1, 2006, when it became a standalone SRO distinct from the NASD (later restructured as FINRA in 2007). This transition established Nasdaq Regulation, Inc., as its dedicated regulatory arm for overseeing listed companies, market makers, and brokers, with enhanced internal controls for surveillance and enforcement, while preserving SEC veto power over rule changes and periodic examinations. The shift addressed prior criticisms of blurred lines, as evidenced by NASD's 1995 governance committee recommendations to divorce regulation from business activities.\n\nSubsequent evolution has emphasized adaptive compliance amid technological and market shifts, including SEC-mandated Regulation NMS in 2005 for unified quoting and routing, and post-2010 Flash Crash measures for circuit breakers and faster reporting. Listing standards have tightened to safeguard investors, with 2011 enhancements for reverse merger scrutiny requiring OTC trading seasoning before uplisting, and 2021 rules imposing audit and disclosure mandates for IPOs from jurisdictions lacking PCAOB access, such as China.  Recent developments include 2023 cybersecurity incident disclosure requirements under SEC rules, and 2024-2025 proposals for accelerated delisting of sub-$0.10 stocks and elevated public float thresholds to curb dilution risks from SPACs and low-quality listings.   These changes reflect a causal progression from scandal-driven transparency mandates to proactive standards addressing systemic risks like geopolitical audit barriers and rapid technological trading, maintaining Nasdaq's integrity under intensified SEC scrutiny.\n\n## Trading Operations and Technology\n\n### Electronic Trading Platform and Innovations\n\nThe Nasdaq Stock Market launched on February 8, 1971, as the world's first fully electronic stock exchange, utilizing a computerized system to disseminate real-time bid and ask quotations from multiple market makers, thereby eliminating the need for a physical trading floor and enabling nationwide connectivity among dealers in over-the-counter securities. This National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (NASDAQ) system initially focused on automated quote dissemination to approximately 500 market makers, facilitating the trading of around 2 billion shares in its debut year through electronic linkages rather than open outcry. Trade executions, however, remained manual via telephone negotiations between dealers until vulnerabilities exposed during the October 1987 market crash—where liquidity evaporated amid rapid sell-offs—prompted enhancements in automation.\n\nIn response to the 1987 crash, Nasdaq introduced the Small Order Execution System (SOES) to automate the execution of small retail orders up to specified tier sizes against market makers' quotes, ensuring automatic fills without negotiation and improving retail access during volatile periods. Complementing SOES, SelectNet was approved in January 1988 as an electronic order-routing service allowing market participants to direct orders to specific market makers for negotiated executions, marking a shift toward screen-based, dealer-to-dealer electronic communications. These systems addressed pre-crash criticisms of fragmented quoting and slow executions, with SOES handling automatic fills for orders as small as 200 shares in National Market System securities, thereby boosting market efficiency and volume. By the mid-1990s, such innovations helped Nasdaq capture nearly half of U.S. equity trading volume, driven by its embrace of computerized order handling over legacy floor-based models.\n\nFurther advancements came with the 2002 rollout of SuperMontage, an order-delivery and execution system that aggregated and displayed multiple levels of quotes from market makers and electronic communications networks (ECNs), prioritizing best-priced orders to enhance transparency and reduce execution costs. In 2005, Nasdaq integrated INET ECN technology, upgrading its core matching engine to support anonymous order books, sub-second latencies, and integration with high-speed data feeds, which solidified its position as a leader in electronic liquidity provision. Contemporary innovations include Nasdaq's multi-asset matching engines, such as those in the Eqlipse platform, capable of processing over 13 billion shares daily with 99.99% uptime, customizable algorithms for price-time priority matching, and support for algorithmic and high-frequency trading via APIs and low-latency connectivity protocols. These engines employ deterministic matching logic to pair buy and sell orders based on price, size, and time, while incorporating risk controls like dynamic circuit breakers to mitigate flash crash risks observed in events like May 6, 2010.\n\n### Market Tiers, Listing Standards, and Procedures\n\nThe Nasdaq Stock Market operates three tiers—the Nasdaq Global Select Market, Nasdaq Global Market, and Nasdaq Capital Market—each with escalating initial listing standards to match companies' scale, financial maturity, and liquidity profiles. These tiers, governed by Nasdaq Listing Rules in the 5000 Series, require applicants to meet at least one of multiple financial benchmarks alongside distribution, liquidity, and corporate governance criteria before approval. The Global Select Market targets established issuers with the most rigorous thresholds, while the Capital Market serves emerging firms with more accessible entry points.\n\nFinancial requirements across tiers emphasize viability through alternatives like income, equity capitalization, market value, or asset-based tests. For the Global Select Market, the income standard demands aggregate pre-tax earnings of $11 million over three fiscal years, including $2.2 million in each of the two most recent years; the equity standard requires stockholders' equity of $55 million, total assets of $80 million, and market capitalization of $160 million; the market value standard mandates $550 million in market capitalization or $850 million under revenue variants; and the assets/equity standard specifies $80 million in assets with $55 million equity. The Global Market lowers these to, for example, $1 million aggregate income under the income test, $15–$30 million equity with $75 million market value of unrestricted publicly held shares (MVUPHS), or $75 million in both assets and revenue for the assets/revenue option. The Capital Market further relaxes thresholds, such as $750,000 net income in one or two of three years, $4–$5 million equity, or $50 million market value of listed securities.\n\nDistribution and liquidity standards ensure broad ownership and tradability: the Global Select requires 450 total round-lot shareholders (or 2,200 if trading volume is low), 1.25 million unrestricted publicly held shares, $45–$110 million MVUPHS, a $4 minimum bid price, and three registered market makers; the Global Market specifies 400 shareholders, 1.1 million shares, $8–$36 million MVUPHS, a $4 bid price, and three to four market makers; while the Capital Market demands 300 shareholders, 1 million shares, $5–$37.5 million MVUPHS, a $3–$4 bid price (with phase-in options), and three market makers. Corporate governance mandates apply uniformly, including a majority-independent board of directors, an audit committee of at least three financially literate independent members, a code of conduct, and compliance with executive compensation and nominating committee independence rules under the 5600 Series.\n\n| Tier              | Income Standard (Aggregate Pre-Tax Earnings) | Equity Standard (Key Thresholds) | Market Value Standard (MVUPHS or Cap) |\n|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| Global Select    | $11M (3 yrs); $2.2M each of last 2 yrs      | $55M equity; $80M assets; $160M cap | $550M–$850M cap; $45M–$110M MVUPHS   |\n| Global Market    | $1M (1–2 of 3 yrs)                          | $15M–$30M equity; $75M MVUPHS    | $75M–$150M cap; $8M–$36M MVUPHS      |\n| Capital Market   | $750K (1–2 of 3 yrs)                        | $4M–$5M equity                   | $50M listed securities value; $5M–$37.5M MVUPHS |\n\nListing procedures begin with gathering SEC CIK, proposed symbol, and CUSIP numbers, followed by account creation on the Nasdaq Listing Center portal. Applicants then submit an electronic Listing Application, Listing Agreement, Corporate Governance Certification, and supporting documents like financial statements and SEC filings, accompanied by non-refundable fees—$295,000 for Global Select or Global tiers, $50,000–$75,000 for Capital Market (with SPAC variants at $80,000). Nasdaq assigns a listing analyst within days for review, typically spanning 4–6 weeks: initial submission and symbol reservation in week 1, staff evaluation and queries in weeks 2–3, applicant responses in weeks 3–6, and conditional or final approval thereafter, contingent on SEC registration effectiveness and ongoing compliance verification. Post-listing, companies face continued standards mirroring initials but with monitoring for bid price ($1 minimum), MVUPHS ($5–$15 million by tier), and market maker commitments, with grace periods and appeal processes for deficiencies.\n\n### Trading Schedule, Contracts, and Data Accessibility\n\nThe Nasdaq Stock Market operates regular trading hours from 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time (ET) on weekdays, excluding U.S. federal holidays such as New Year's Day, Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Presidents' Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Juneteenth, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. Extended-hours trading includes pre-market sessions from 4:00 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. ET and after-hours sessions from 4:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. ET, facilitated electronically with participation from market makers and electronic communication networks (ECNs), though liquidity and volatility can differ significantly from core hours. The overall system accepts orders from 4:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. ET on business days.\n\nNasdaq supports trading in various derivative contracts, including equity options with hours aligned to core market times (9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. ET), and index futures such as the E-mini Nasdaq-100, primarily cleared through the CME Group. The E-mini Nasdaq-100 futures contract, with a multiplier of $20 times the Nasdaq-100 Index, trades nearly 24 hours a day from Sunday to Friday on CME Globex, enabling hedging and speculation on Nasdaq-listed technology-heavy components. These contracts settle quarterly to the Nasdaq-100 price and provide leveraged exposure without direct stock ownership.\n\nMarket data accessibility is provided through Nasdaq Data Link, offering APIs for real-time and historical feeds including quotes, trades, and order book depth via products like TotalView, which delivers full market depth unmatched by aggregated feeds. Users access data via RESTful APIs, WebSocket streams, or downloads in formats compatible with Python, R, and Excel, with premium datasets requiring subscriptions while basic end-of-day data remains free. Direct feeds and vendor integrations ensure low-latency distribution, though access levels vary by user type (e.g., non-display for algorithmic trading).\n\n## Indexes and Market Benchmarks\n\n### Primary Indexes and Their Composition\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite Index (COMP) encompasses all domestic and international common stocks listed exclusively on the Nasdaq Stock Market, excluding preferred stocks, convertible debentures, ETFs, and derivative securities. As of October 2025, it includes 3,330 components, providing a broad benchmark for the exchange's overall performance with a heavy emphasis on technology and growth-oriented companies. The index employs a market capitalization-weighted methodology, where larger companies exert greater influence on its movements, reflecting the exchange's composition dominated by innovative sectors rather than traditional industries.\n\nThe Nasdaq-100 Index (NDX), another flagship benchmark, selects the 100 largest non-financial companies listed on Nasdaq based on full market capitalization, incorporating both domestic and international issuers across multiple share classes where applicable. Eligible securities must meet liquidity and listing criteria, with annual reconstitution in December to refresh the roster and quarterly rebalancing to adjust weights, preventing excessive concentration in any single constituent—capped such that no company exceeds 24% and the collective top five do not surpass 40% of the index. This modified capitalization-weighted approach highlights sectors like information technology, consumer discretionary, communication services, and health care, which collectively represent the majority of its weighting, underscoring Nasdaq's role in tracking high-growth, non-bank entities.\n\n### Methodology, Calculation, and Usage\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite Index employs a market capitalization-weighted methodology, incorporating all eligible common stocks listed exclusively on the Nasdaq Stock Market, including domestic ordinary shares, American Depositary Receipts (ADRs), and limited partnership interests, while excluding closed-end funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), preferred stocks, and warrants. Eligibility requires at least one day of trading with a Nasdaq Official Closing Price, with no additional thresholds for market capitalization, liquidity, float, geography, or sector. Weights are determined daily using the security's Last Sale Price multiplied by its Total Shares Outstanding (TSO), ensuring the index reflects the relative economic size of constituents without individual caps. The index value is calculated continuously during trading hours (9:30:01 a.m. to 5:16:00 p.m. ET) based on Last Sale Prices, disseminated every second, with the official closing value potentially adjusted until 5:15:00 p.m. ET for late price corrections; corporate actions are handled via a market cap adjustment method per Nasdaq guidelines. Reconstitution and rebalancing occur daily at market open, reflecting real-time listing changes without advance announcements.\n\nIn usage, the Nasdaq Composite serves as a comprehensive benchmark for the performance of Nasdaq-listed equities, particularly tracking technology and growth-oriented sectors, and is employed by asset managers, financial advisors, and ETF providers for constructing diversified portfolios and broad-market investment products.\n\nThe Nasdaq-100 Index utilizes a modified market capitalization-weighted approach for its 100 largest non-financial constituents listed on Nasdaq's Global Select or Global Market tiers, selecting securities such as common stocks, tracking stocks, and ADRs while excluding financial firms (per Industry Classification Benchmark), real estate investment trusts (REITs), special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), and those with insufficient seasoning (less than three months listed), liquidity (three-month average daily traded value below $5 million), or float (below 10%). Weights derive from price times TSO, subject to quarterly caps limiting any single company to 24% and the aggregate of those exceeding 4.5% to 48%, with annual adjustments tightening to 14% per security, 38.5% for the top five, and proportional reductions for others to mitigate concentration risk. Calculation mirrors the Composite, using Last Sale Prices updated every second during trading hours, with rebalancing effective after the third Friday of March, June, September, and December, alongside annual reconstitution post-December's third Friday and special rebalances if caps are breached.\n\nThe Nasdaq-100 functions primarily as a benchmark for large-cap growth and innovation-driven equities, underpinning exchange-traded products like the Invesco QQQ ETF, futures contracts such as CME Group's E-mini Nasdaq-100, and options for hedging or speculation, enabling investors to access concentrated exposure to technology and consumer sectors.\n\nBoth indexes support price return variants, with total return versions incorporating dividends, and are computed via standardized equity index formulas emphasizing last-sale pricing to capture intraday market dynamics, though official values prioritize end-of-day data for settlement purposes.\n\n## Comparative Analysis\n\n### Key Differences from NYSE\n\nThe Nasdaq operates as a dealer market where multiple market makers compete to provide liquidity by quoting bid and ask prices for securities, facilitating trades through electronic networks without a central physical location. In contrast, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) functions primarily as an auction market, matching buy and sell orders directly via a hybrid system that combines electronic trading with floor-based specialists (designated market makers) who maintain orderly markets for assigned stocks. This structural difference stems from Nasdaq's inception in 1971 as the world's first fully electronic exchange, eliminating the need for a trading floor, whereas the NYSE, established in 1792, retained a physical floor until progressively adopting electronic elements, with hybrid trading formalized in the mid-2000s.\n\nNasdaq's listing standards are tiered into three levels—Global Select Market, Global Market, and Capital Market—with quantitative criteria such as minimum market value of publicly held shares starting at $50 million for the top tier and $5 million for the Capital Market, alongside requirements for at least 450 round-lot holders in higher tiers. The NYSE imposes stricter initial listing thresholds, including a minimum aggregate market value of publicly held shares of $100 million (or $60 million under certain standards), at least 2,200 total shareholders or 500 round-lot holders, and higher profitability or equity tests, favoring more mature enterprises. Listing fees on Nasdaq are typically 70% to 80% lower than on the NYSE, contributing to its appeal for smaller, growth-oriented firms, particularly in technology and biotechnology sectors, while the NYSE attracts larger, established blue-chip companies.\n\nIn terms of market metrics, Nasdaq processes higher average daily trading volume—exceeding 4 billion shares as of recent data—due to its electronic efficiency and concentration of volatile, high-turnover stocks, compared to the NYSE's focus on stability with lower relative volume but greater total market capitalization of listed companies, around $25 trillion versus Nasdaq's $20 trillion in 2023. NYSE-listed stocks have exhibited tighter bid-ask spreads and lower intraday volatility in empirical studies, attributed to the auction mechanism's price discovery, though Nasdaq's competitive dealer system enables faster execution for high-frequency trading. Between 2000 and 2024, over 500 companies, representing $2.7 trillion in market value, delisted from the NYSE to Nasdaq, often citing cost savings and technological alignment.\n\n### Nasdaq in the Global Exchange Landscape\n\nNasdaq ranks as the second-largest stock exchange globally by market capitalization, totaling $29.9 trillion as of July 31, 2025, behind only the New York Stock Exchange's $31.7 trillion. This positioning underscores its dominance in technology and growth-oriented listings, attracting international firms seeking U.S. investor access, with over 3,285 listed companies including significant foreign entities from regions like Asia and Europe.\nThrough Nasdaq Inc., the exchange extends its operations beyond the U.S. via subsidiaries managing Nordic and Baltic markets, encompassing exchanges in Stockholm, Copenhagen, Helsinki, Reykjavik, Tallinn, Riga, and Vilnius. These platforms serve as gateways for European growth companies, with Nasdaq First North alone listing more than 550 firms targeting Nordic and international capital. This European footprint enhances Nasdaq's role in cross-border trading, though it represents a fraction of its primary U.S.-centric volume.\nNasdaq's technological infrastructure further amplifies its global influence, with platforms and services adopted by exchanges in over 50 countries and integrated into more than 90 venues worldwide to optimize securities trading. In terms of trading volume, while U.S. equities dominate—Nasdaq capturing around 20-25% of consolidated U.S. tape volume in recent data—its electronic model competes with traditional floors like those of the London Stock Exchange or Euronext, emphasizing speed and innovation over physical presence. Globally, Nasdaq's focus on high-growth sectors positions it as a key venue for tech-driven capital formation, contrasting with volume-heavy commodity exchanges in Asia, such as Shanghai or Tokyo.\n\n## Economic Impact and Achievements\n\n### Facilitation of Innovation and Capital Formation\n\nThe Nasdaq Stock Market serves as a primary venue for initial public offerings (IPOs) by innovative companies, enabling them to raise substantial capital for research, development, and expansion. In the first half of 2025 alone, Nasdaq hosted 142 IPOs that collectively raised $19.2 billion, with a significant portion involving technology and growth-oriented firms seeking funds to scale operations and invest in emerging technologies. This access to public equity markets allows venture-backed startups to transition from private funding to broader investor bases, providing liquidity to early supporters while injecting capital into high-risk, high-reward ventures that drive sectoral advancements.\n\nNasdaq's tiered listing structure, including the Nasdaq Capital Market for smaller issuers, lowers entry barriers compared to traditional exchanges, attracting nascent innovators in fields like biotechnology, software, and semiconductors without requiring the extensive track record demanded elsewhere. This framework has historically supported capital formation for companies at critical growth stages; for example, the exchange's electronic trading model, introduced in 1971, facilitated efficient matching of supply and demand, reducing costs and enabling faster capital deployment for listed firms. By 2025, Nasdaq's policy advocacy, such as recommendations for streamlined regulations, further aims to balance investor protections with expanded access for emerging issuers, countering regulatory hurdles that could stifle early-stage funding.\n\nProminent listings underscore Nasdaq's role in nurturing innovation ecosystems. The Nasdaq-100 Index, tracking 100 large non-financial companies, features leaders like Apple (listed 1980), Microsoft (1986), Amazon (1997), and Nvidia, which have leveraged IPO proceeds and subsequent equity issuances to fund breakthroughs in computing, cloud services, and artificial intelligence. These firms' access to public markets has enabled sustained investment in proprietary technologies, with Nasdaq's transparent, automated platform providing ongoing liquidity that sustains long-term capital inflows—evidenced by the index's composition of entities responsible for substantial portions of U.S. patent filings and R\\u0026D expenditures in tech sectors. Empirical outcomes include accelerated product development cycles and market disruptions, as capital raised through Nasdaq listings directly correlates with increased innovation outputs in listed companies' portfolios.\n\nOverall, Nasdaq's mechanisms have contributed to a virtuous cycle of capital formation, where public listings democratize investment in unproven ideas, yielding returns that recycle into new ventures. This process underpins broader economic dynamism, as evidenced by the exchange's facilitation of over 3,500 venture capital-backed IPOs historically, predominantly in technology, which have amplified productivity gains across industries. While self-reported by exchange operators, these patterns align with observable market data showing Nasdaq-listed innovators outperforming in capital efficiency metrics during growth phases.\n\n### Contributions to U.S. Economic Growth and Tech Sector\n\nNasdaq's electronic trading platform, launched on February 8, 1971, revolutionized capital markets by enabling faster, lower-cost access to public equity for growth-oriented companies, particularly in technology, thereby accelerating innovation and expansion. Unlike traditional floor-based exchanges, Nasdaq's automated system facilitated efficient matching of buyers and sellers, reducing transaction frictions and attracting firms seeking rapid scaling without the stringent listing hurdles of legacy markets. This structure has channeled billions in investment into tech ventures, supporting research, development, and job creation that underpin broader economic productivity gains.\n\nThe exchange's focus on technology and biotech listings has positioned it as a primary engine for the U.S. tech sector's ascent, with over 50% of its weighted composition in information technology as of 2025. Nasdaq-listed companies have raised substantial capital through initial public offerings (IPOs), exemplified by 142 IPOs generating $19.2 billion in the first half of 2025 alone—the highest such volume since 2021. Historically, this capital formation has enabled transformative firms to deploy resources toward disruptive technologies, contributing to sector-led GDP expansion; equity markets like Nasdaq mobilize savings into productive investments, fostering efficient resource allocation and long-term growth.\n\nQuantitatively, Nasdaq's market capitalization reached 103% of U.S. GDP by late 2024, surpassing dot-com bubble highs and reflecting the tech sector's amplified economic footprint amid productivity surges from digital innovation. The Nasdaq Composite Index, tracking over 3,000 stocks with tech-heavy weighting, has delivered annualized returns averaging around 15% from 2015 to 2025, correlating with corporate earnings growth and broader market advances that signal robust capital efficiency. These dynamics have bolstered U.S. competitiveness, with Nasdaq facilitating the tech industry's role in driving approximately 40% of recent GDP acceleration through AI and software advancements, though such estimates derive from market analyses emphasizing causal links via investment inflows.\n\n## Controversies and Criticisms\n\n### Historical Scandals and Market Manipulation Probes\n\nIn the mid-1990s, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Department of Justice (DOJ) launched investigations into Nasdaq market makers for alleged collusion to maintain artificially wide bid-ask spreads, a practice known as the \"quoting scandal.\" An academic study published in 1994 by economists William Christie and Paul Schultz analyzed trading data and found that for many Nasdaq stocks, market makers systematically avoided quoting prices in odd-eighth increments (e.g., $10 1/8), which would have allowed narrower spreads of 1/8 point; instead, quotes clustered in even-eighths, effectively enforcing a minimum 1/4-point spread and increasing trading costs for investors by an estimated $1 billion annually.\n\nThe DOJ's probe, initiated in 1994, culminated in July 1996 with criminal charges against 24 major Nasdaq securities firms, including accusations of conspiring to fix prices through coordinated quoting practices and retaliating against market makers who attempted narrower spreads. The SEC's parallel civil investigation revealed that the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD), which then regulated Nasdaq, failed to adequately supervise these practices, including unreported trades and coordinated price movements. In August 1996, the SEC censured the NASD, imposed a $6 million fine (half suspended), and mandated reforms such as improved surveillance and public disclosure of quote data.\n\nThese probes led to significant settlements: in 1996, firms entered deferred prosecution agreements with the DOJ, agreeing to antitrust training and compliance programs; civil suits resulted in a $900 million class-action settlement by 30 firms in December 1997 to compensate affected investors for inflated spreads dating back to the early 1990s. Additional fines followed, including a 1999 SEC agreement with brokers for Nasdaq trading abuses tied to the same era, totaling millions in penalties. The scandals prompted regulatory changes, such as the SEC's 1997 Order Handling Rules requiring market makers to display customer limit orders, which narrowed spreads and enhanced transparency, though critics argued enforcement remained lax thereafter.\n\nSubsequent probes have occasionally implicated Nasdaq entities in manipulation-related issues, but none matched the 1990s scale. For instance, in 2011, the SEC charged a former Nasdaq managing director with insider trading on non-public merger information, yielding $175,000 in illicit profits, though this was an individual case rather than systemic. More recently, Nordic Nasdaq exchanges faced fines for surveillance failures enabling insider trading, such as a 2024 SEK 100 million penalty on Nasdaq Stockholm for inadequate monitoring of unauthorized trades, highlighting ongoing vulnerabilities in oversight. These incidents underscore persistent challenges in preventing collusive or manipulative behaviors in dealer-driven markets like Nasdaq's, despite post-1990s reforms.\n\n### Forced Diversity Policies and Regulatory Pushback\n\nIn December 2020, Nasdaq proposed amendments to its listing standards requiring most domestic issuers to have, or explain the absence of, diverse board representation, defining diversity to include at least one director who self-identifies as female and one who self-identifies as an underrepresented minority or LGBTQ+. Companies with five or fewer directors needed only one diverse member under the same criteria, while the rules also mandated annual disclosure of a board diversity matrix detailing directors' self-identified gender, race, ethnicity, and LGBTQ+ status in SEC filings. Nasdaq justified the measures as advancing a \"diversity imperative\" to enhance corporate governance and investor confidence, citing studies it claimed showed correlations between board diversity and firm performance, though critics later contested the causal evidence and highlighted risks of superficial compliance or mismatched qualifications.\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the rules on August 6, 2021, by a 3-2 vote, determining they were consistent with the Exchange Act's goals of promoting fair and orderly markets despite dissenting commissioners arguing insufficient evidence of investor protection benefits and potential overreach into private governance. Compliance deadlines were phased, with larger companies required to meet standards by August 2023 and smaller ones by 2025, but implementation was halted amid legal challenges.\n\nOpposition emerged swiftly from conservative advocacy groups, state attorneys general, and shareholder representatives, who filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas in 2021, contending the rules exceeded SEC authority under the Exchange Act by imposing ideological mandates unrelated to market integrity, compelled speech in violation of the First Amendment, and equal protection issues under the Fourteenth Amendment. Critics, including legal scholars, argued the policy functioned as de facto quotas fostering tokenism, potentially prioritizing demographic traits over merit and exposing firms to litigation risks without proven economic upside, as empirical reviews found no robust link between mandated diversity and outperformance. \n\nThe district court dismissed constitutional claims but upheld the Exchange Act challenge in November 2022, prompting SEC appeal; a Fifth Circuit panel reversed in October 2023, finding the approval non-arbitrary. However, on en banc rehearing, the full Fifth Circuit vacated the SEC's approval on December 11, 2024, ruling it arbitrary and capricious for failing to address evidence of investor harm, inconsistently applying disclosure standards compared to other rules, and straying from the Exchange Act's core investor-protection mandate into social engineering.  Nasdaq subsequently repealed the rules, with SEC approval effective February 4, 2025, relieving listed companies of compliance while leaving voluntary diversity efforts intact amid broader scrutiny of similar mandates. The decision has fueled debates on regulatory overreach in diversity initiatives, with proponents decrying it as a setback for inclusion and opponents viewing it as a check against unsubstantiated coercion in corporate boardrooms.\n\n### Volatility Amplification and High-Frequency Trading Issues\n\nHigh-frequency trading (HFT) on the Nasdaq, facilitated by its electronic market structure, has been linked to amplified intraday volatility through mechanisms such as rapid order cancellations and feedback loops in liquidity provision. Algorithms executing trades in microseconds can withdraw quotes en masse during stress events, exacerbating price swings beyond fundamental drivers; empirical analysis shows HFT activity correlates with a 30% average increase in volatility across affected markets.\n\nThe May 6, 2010, Flash Crash exemplified these risks, where HFT contributed to a rapid market plunge and partial recovery within minutes, with Nasdaq-listed stocks experiencing drops up to 60% in individual names before rebounding. Investigations by the CFTC and SEC concluded that HFT firms, responding to an initial large sell order in E-mini S\\u0026P 500 futures, accelerated the depletion of order queues, leading to Nasdaq volatility 6.7 times greater than broader indices. This event highlighted causal chains where HFT speed intensifies imbalances: heightened volatility prompts faster algorithmic reactions, further eroding liquidity and amplifying declines.\n\nCritics argue Nasdaq's design, including low-latency access and maker-taker pricing, incentivizes predatory HFT practices like quote stuffing—flooding markets with orders to manipulate perceptions—which distorts price discovery and raises systemic risks. While proponents claim HFT narrows spreads, studies indicate it doubles intraday volatility in some cases without proportional long-term efficiency gains. Nasdaq's 2025 decision to discontinue a high-speed data feed service for select clients followed SEC scrutiny over potential unfair advantages, underscoring ongoing concerns about HFT's role in uneven market access and crash propensity.",
