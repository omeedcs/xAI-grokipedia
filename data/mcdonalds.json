Founded in 1940 in San Bernardino, California, by brothers Richard and Maurice McDonald, the company pioneered the modern fast-food model with its emphasis on speed, affordability, and consistency. Headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, McDonald's operates over 40,000 locations in more than 100 countries, serving millions of customers daily with a menu centered on hamburgers, fries, and other quick-service items [McDonald's Corporate Overview](https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/corpmcd/about-us/our-history.html). Known for its iconic Golden Arches logo and mascots like Ronald McDonald, the brand has become a symbol of American culture and globalization, though it has also faced criticism over health, labor, and environmental concerns.\n\n## Historical Background\n\nThe origins of McDonald's trace back to a small drive-in barbecue restaurant opened by Richard and Maurice McDonald in 1940. In 1948, the brothers revolutionized their business by introducing the \"Speedee Service System,\" a streamlined approach to food preparation that prioritized efficiency and low costs. This system laid the groundwork for the fast-food industry, focusing on a limited menu of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, and fries [History.com - McDonald's History](https://www.history.com/topics/inventions/mcdonalds).\n\nIn 1954, Ray Kroc, a milkshake machine salesman, visited the McDonald brothers' restaurant and was impressed by their innovative model. Kroc partnered with the brothers to expand the business through franchising, opening the first franchise location in Des Plaines, Illinois, in 1955. By 1961, Kroc bought out the McDonald brothers for $2.7 million and aggressively expanded the chain, turning it into a national and eventually global phenomenon [BBC - Ray Kroc and McDonald's](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-38605825).\n\nUnder Kroc's leadership, McDonald's introduced standardized menus, branding, and operational systems. The company went public in 1965, and by the 1970s, it had expanded internationally, opening locations in Canada, Europe, and Asia. Signature menu items like the Big Mac (introduced in 1967) and Happy Meal (1979) became cultural staples [McDonald's Menu History](https://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en-us/about-our-food/our-history.html).\n\n## Current Status and Relevance\n\nAs of 2023, McDonald's is one of the world's largest restaurant chains by revenue, generating over $23 billion annually and employing approximately 200,000 people directly, with millions more employed through franchises [Statista - McDonald's Revenue](https://www.statista.com/statistics/219454/mcdonalds-revenue-by-segment/). The company operates on a franchise model, with about 95% of its locations owned and operated by independent franchisees [McDonald's Franchise Information](https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/corpmcd/franchising.html).\n\nMcDonald's remains a cultural and economic force, often seen as a barometer of globalization through the \"Big Mac Index,\" an informal economic indicator created by *The Economist* to compare purchasing power across countries [The Economist - Big Mac Index](https://www.economist.com/big-mac-index). The chain has adapted to local markets by offering region-specific menu items, such as the McAloo Tikki in India and Teriyaki Burgers in Japan.\n\nHowever, McDonald's faces ongoing challenges, including criticism over the nutritional value of its food, contributing to obesity and related health issues [Harvard Health - Fast Food Impact](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/fast-food-not-the-major-cause-of-rising-childhood-obesity-rates-201412194870). The company has also been scrutinized for labor practices, including low wages and working conditions, leading to protests and lawsuits in various countries [The Guardian - McDonald's Labor Issues](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/sep/27/mcdonalds-workers-strike-low-wages-sexual-harassment). In response, McDonald's has introduced healthier menu options, committed to sustainability goals (like reducing greenhouse gas emissions), and increased minimum wages in some markets [McDonald's Sustainability Report](https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/corpmcd/our-purpose-and-impact/our-plan-for-change.html).\n\n## Notable Facts and Details\n\n- **Iconic Branding**: The Golden Arches, first introduced in 1953, are one of the most recognizable corporate logos worldwide.
