  "content": "# Rafael Nadal\n\nRafael Nadal Parera (born 3 June 1986) is a retired Spanish professional tennis player widely regarded as one of the greatest in the sport's history, renowned for his exceptional athleticism, mental toughness, and dominance on clay courts, earning him the nickname \"King of Clay.\" Over a 23-year career, he amassed 22 Grand Slam singles titles—the second-most in the Open Era behind Novak Djokovic's 24—including a record 14 victories at the French Open (Roland Garros), where he compiled a 112–4 win-loss record. Nadal also secured four US Open titles, two Australian Open crowns, and two Wimbledon championships, achieving the Career Grand Slam twice. Additionally, he won Olympic gold medals in singles at the 2008 Beijing Games and in doubles at the 2016 Rio Olympics, contributing to Spain's success in five Davis Cup titles.\n\nBorn in Manacor, Mallorca, Spain, Nadal began playing tennis at age four under the guidance of his uncle and coach Toni Nadal, who instilled a rigorous training regimen that emphasized endurance and baseline play. A natural right-hander, he adopted a left-handed playing style with a two-handed backhand, which became a hallmark of his powerful, topspin-heavy game. Nadal turned professional in 2001 at age 15 and burst onto the scene in 2005, winning his first French Open title as a 19-year-old and capturing four Masters 1000 events that year, launching a streak of 81 consecutive clay-court wins from 2005 to 2007. His career totals include 92 ATP singles titles—63 on clay—and over 1,000 match wins, with a career-high ranking of world No. 1 held for 209 weeks across five stints.\n\nNadal's career was defined by epic rivalries with Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic, and Andy Murray, forming the core of the \"Big Four\" era that elevated men's tennis. His 24–16 head-to-head record against Federer, including the iconic 2008 Wimbledon final, and 29–31 record against Djokovic (with Djokovic holding the edge after their final match at the 2024 Olympics) highlighted his versatility beyond clay. However, chronic injuries, particularly to his knees, feet, and wrists, forced him to miss 18 Grand Slams and limited his play in later years, including much of 2023. Nadal announced his retirement in late 2023 and concluded his career in November 2024 by representing Spain in the Davis Cup finals in Málaga, where he lost to Botic van de Zandschulp in his final professional match.\n\nBeyond the court, Nadal founded the Rafa Nadal Foundation in 2008 and the Rafa Nadal Academy in 2016, focusing on youth education and tennis development in Spain and India. He married longtime partner Maria Francisca Perelló in 2019, and they welcomed a son, Rafael, in 2022. Nadal's legacy extends to philanthropy, including donations exceeding €14 million for COVID-19 relief and support for disaster victims. His humility, intensity, and sportsmanship have made him a global icon, inspiring generations of players.\n\n## Early years\n\n### Early life\n\nRafael Nadal Parera was born on June 3, 1986, in Manacor, a town on the island of Mallorca in Spain, to parents Sebastián Nadal Homar, a businessman who owns a restaurant and glass company, and Ana María Parera Femenías, who previously ran a perfume shop before focusing on family. He has a younger sister, María Isabel Nadal, commonly known as Maribel, and comes from a family with strong athletic ties; his paternal uncle, Miguel Ángel Nadal, was a professional footballer who played for FC Barcelona and the Spain national team, earning 62 caps and participating in three FIFA World Cups. Nadal's paternal grandfather, also named Rafael Nadal, was a prominent musician and conductor in Manacor, directing local choirs and bands for decades.\n\nNadal exhibited early ambidexterity, being naturally right-handed for activities like writing, eating, and playing other sports such as golf or basketball, but he plays tennis left-handed—a decision influenced by his uncle Toni Nadal, who noticed his stronger left-hand forehand during initial training and encouraged him to develop it for a competitive advantage starting around age 8. At age 3, Nadal was introduced to tennis by his uncle Toni, a former professional player who became his lifelong coach and began instilling rigorous training at the Manacor Tennis Club; from around age 4, Toni emphasized mental toughness through demanding drills, such as requiring Nadal to retrieve every ball and endure tough conditions, fostering resilience that shaped his approach to the sport.\n\nGrowing up in Manacor, Nadal balanced his early education at local schools with budding athletic pursuits, developing a strong passion for football influenced by his uncle Miguel Ángel's career, though he supported Real Madrid despite his uncle's Barcelona affiliation, often playing the sport recreationally alongside tennis. By age 12, Nadal shifted to a more intensive tennis-focused routine, commuting to a training center in Palma, about 50 kilometers from Manacor, while continuing his schooling, marking the point where the sport became central to his daily life.\n\n### Junior career\n\nNadal began his junior tennis career at the age of 11, competing in his first tournament in November 1997 in Hilversum, Netherlands, marking the start of a rapid ascent in Spanish and European events. Under the guidance of his uncle Toni Nadal, who emphasized rigorous daily training sessions of around four hours focused on baseline play on clay courts, he quickly established himself as a prodigy. By 1998, Nadal had won the Spanish Junior Championships, defeating Marcel Granollers in the final, building on his victory over Ricardo Villacorta the previous year.\n\nIn 1999, at age 13, Nadal dominated the under-14 category, securing the Spanish national title and advancing to the final of the prestigious Bonfiglio Trophy, an International Tennis Federation (ITF) junior clay-court event in Milan. The following year, 2000, proved even more successful as he captured Category 1 ITF junior titles at Les Petits As in Tarbes, France—a renowned under-14 tournament—and the Costa Brava International Tournament, while again reaching the Bonfiglio Trophy final. Nadal also contributed decisively to Spain's victory in the ITF World Junior Tennis under-14 team championship that year, showcasing his emerging prowess on clay.\n\nRecognizing his potential, Nadal decided to turn professional at age 15 in 2001, forgoing a complete junior Grand Slam circuit to preserve his development and avoid early burnout, although he made limited but significant junior appearances in 2002, reaching the semi-finals at Junior Wimbledon and contributing to Spain's Junior Davis Cup victory. This transition was supported by early ATP wildcard entries into professional events, highlighting the tennis establishment's high expectations for the young Spaniard, often drawing parallels to Bjorn Borg for his clay-court intensity and endurance. His family, particularly uncle Toni's demanding coaching regimen, played a crucial role in fostering the mental and physical toughness that defined his early promise.\n\n## Professional career\n\n### 2001–2002: Start of professional career\n\nRafael Nadal turned professional in 2001 at the age of 15, beginning his career on the ITF Futures circuit after a successful junior tenure that aided his quick adaptation to competitive play. His debut match came on September 11, 2001, at the Spain F10 Futures in Madrid, where he lost to Guillermo Platel-Varas 2-6, 7-5, 6-2 despite holding 13 match points. Later that month, Nadal secured his first professional win and earned his initial ATP ranking points by reaching the quarterfinals of another Futures event, debuting in the ATP rankings at No. 762 on September 24, 2001.\n\nIn 2002, Nadal continued building experience on the Futures tour, claiming his first title at the Spain F14 event in Alicante in July and ultimately winning six Futures tournaments that year, which helped him climb the rankings. He made his ATP Tour main draw debut at the Mallorca Open in April, receiving a wildcard entry and defeating world No. 81 Ramón Delgado 6-4, 6-4 in the first round before falling to Tommy Robredo 6-1, 6-3 in the second round. Later in the season, Nadal qualified for several Challenger events and attempted qualifications for ATP tournaments like Palermo but did not advance to additional main draws, ending the year ranked No. 200 after a 40-9 singles record on the Futures circuit.\n\nDuring this period, Nadal underwent significant physical development, growing to his adult height of 6 feet 1 inch (1.85 m) and emphasizing endurance training under his uncle Toni Nadal's guidance to build stamina for longer matches, though he experienced minor early knee discomfort that did not significantly hinder his progress. He also contributed to Spain's Junior Davis Cup team in 2002, helping secure the title at age 16. Financially, Nadal earned just $6,850 in prize money that year, relying heavily on support from his family—his father Sebastián's business ventures and uncle Toni's coaching—to sustain his budding career without substantial independent income.\n\n### 2003: First ATP title and ascending to the top 50\n\nIn 2003, at the age of 16, Rafael Nadal achieved his first significant professional breakthroughs by securing two ATP Challenger Tour titles, marking a pivotal step in his transition from junior to professional tennis. His inaugural Challenger victory came at the Barletta Challenger in March, where he defeated Filippo Volandri in the final, 7-6(4), 6-4, on clay courts in Italy. Later that year, in September, Nadal claimed his second Challenger title at the Messina Challenger, overcoming Tomas Berdych 6-3, 6-1 in the final, which helped solidify his growing reputation on the surface. These successes, combined with reaching five Challenger finals throughout the season, demonstrated his emerging prowess and built momentum from his early professional experiences in 2001 and 2002.\n\nNadal's rapid ascent was evident in his ATP Tour performances, where he notched his first victory over a top-10 player by defeating world No. 5 Carlos Moya 6-4, 6-3 in the second round of the Hamburg Masters in May. This upset highlighted his potential against elite competition and contributed to a strong clay-court campaign, including a semifinal run at the Umag Open and third-round appearances at the Monte Carlo Masters and Hamburg. Although an elbow injury forced him to withdraw from the French Open—preventing a debut there—Nadal showcased clay dominance elsewhere, compiling a 20-5 record on the surface for the year and reaching the third round of Wimbledon in his Grand Slam debut, losing to Paradorn Srichaphan. His overall season record stood at 41-15, reflecting consistent improvement.\n\nBy year's end, Nadal's results propelled his ATP ranking from No. 189 at the start to No. 50, a surge that earned him over $222,000 in prize money and drew early media attention. Affectionately nicknamed \"Rafa\" by fans and commentators—a common Spanish diminutive for Rafael—Nadal began to be recognized as a promising talent on clay, though the \"King of Clay\" moniker would emerge later with his major successes. These achievements laid the foundation for his future dominance, positioning him as one of the sport's rising stars.\n\n### 2004: Davis Cup title\n\nFollowing a stress fracture in his left ankle sustained during the Estoril Open in April 2004, Nadal was forced to withdraw from the French Open, marking the first and only time he missed the tournament until 2023. He returned to competition in July at the Swedish Open in Båstad, where he advanced to the quarterfinals before falling to Gastón Gaudio 0-6, 3-6.\n\nNadal captured his maiden ATP singles title at the Idea Prokom Open in Sopot later that month, defeating José Acasuso 6-3, 6-4 in the final to become the youngest champion on the tour since Lleyton Hewitt in 1998. In September, he reached the second round of the Campionati Internazionali di Sicilia in Palermo, upsetting Nicolás Almagro in the opener before losing to Olivier Mutis 3-6, 3-6.\n\nThese results on clay built on the momentum from his two Challenger titles in 2003, propelling Nadal into the ATP top 50 for the first time. His strong post-injury clay campaign concluded with a pivotal role in Spain's Davis Cup triumph, securing the nation's second title in the competition's history.\n\nIn the final against the United States at Estadio de La Cartuja in Seville—played on indoor clay to suit the home team—18-year-old Nadal partnered with Tommy Robredo to win the doubles rubber against the Bryan brothers 6-7(3), 7-6(6), 6-4, 6-4 on the second day, giving Spain an unassailable 3-0 lead. The following day, he clinched the tie with a 6-7(6), 6-2, 7-6(6), 6-2 victory over world No. 2 Andy Roddick in singles, saving three match points in the third-set tiebreak during a match that lasted nearly three hours. Nadal finished the year ranked No. 51 with a 41-15 overall record, including 29-6 on clay.\n\nThe breakthrough performances elevated Nadal's profile, drawing heightened interest from sponsors like Nike, which had backed him since his junior days but expanded its endorsement amid his rising success.\n\n### 2005: First major title\n\nEntering the 2005 season as an 18-year-old ranked No. 51, Rafael Nadal quickly established himself as a dominant force on clay courts, winning five ATP titles leading up to the French Open. These victories included the Brazil Open in Costa do Sauipe, where he defeated Alberto Martín 6-0, 6-7(2), 6-1 in the final; the Abierto Mexicano in Acapulco, crushing Albert Montañés 6-1, 6-0; his maiden Masters 1000 crown at the Monte-Carlo Masters against Guillermo Coria 6-3, 6-1, 0-6, 7-5; the Barcelona Open Banc Sabadell over Juan Carlos Ferrero 6-1, 7-6(5), 6-3; and the Internazionali BNL d'Italia in Rome, beating Guillermo Coria again 6-2, 6-4, 4-6, 7-6(0). These triumphs showcased his explosive topspin forehand and relentless baseline play, propelling him into the top 10 for the first time.\n\nAt the French Open, Nadal made his Grand Slam debut and captured his first major title at age 19, defeating Mariano Puerta in a grueling four-set final 6-7(6), 6-3, 6-1, 7-5 after 3 hours and 24 minutes on Court Philippe-Chatrier. En route, he dropped just one set across six matches, including a straight-sets semifinal win over world No. 1 Roger Federer, demonstrating poise under pressure honed from his 2004 Davis Cup experience. This victory marked the beginning of his unparalleled dominance at Roland Garros and earned him widespread acclaim as \"The King of Clay\" in the media.\n\nNadal's clay-court mastery in 2005 extended to a 24-match winning streak from Acapulco through the French Open, underscoring his adaptation to the surface's demands. He transitioned to grass for the first time at Wimbledon, reaching the third round before losing to Gilles Müller 6-4, 4-6, 6-3, 6-4. At the US Open, his hard-court campaign ended in the second round against James Blake 6-3, 4-6, 4-6, 7-6(4), 6-4.\n\nBy year-end, Nadal had secured 11 ATP titles—tying Roger Federer for the most that season—and finished ranked world No. 2, having earned approximately $1.24 million in prize money. His breakout year solidified his status as a generational talent, with his physical intensity and mental resilience setting the stage for sustained excellence.\n\n### 2006: Second French Open title\n\nNadal entered the 2006 season having established himself as a dominant force on clay following his breakthrough French Open victory the previous year. Missing the Australian Open due to a foot injury, he quickly adapted to hard courts by capturing his first title on the surface at the Dubai Tennis Championships, defeating Roger Federer in the final 2–6, 6–4, 6–4 to end the world No. 1's 56-match winning streak on the surface.\n\nTransitioning to clay, Nadal embarked on an undefeated run of 26 matches, securing four consecutive titles in the lead-up to the French Open. He defended his Monte Carlo Masters crown with a straight-sets victory over Federer in the final, followed by triumphs at the Barcelona Open against Tommy Robredo and the Rome Masters against Federer once more, marking back-to-back Masters 1000 wins on clay. These victories propelled him to a career-high world No. 2 ranking on May 22, 2006, for the first time.\n\nAt the French Open, Nadal successfully defended his title, extending his perfect record at Roland Garros to 28–0 matches. He dropped sets in earlier rounds, including a grueling four-set battle against Paul-Henri Mathieu in the third round and a four-set semifinal win over Nikolay Davydenko, but dominated the final against Federer 1–6, 6–1, 6–4, 7–6(4), securing his second major championship. This victory extended his consecutive major match wins to 14 and broke Guillermo Vilas's record of 53 straight clay-court victories during his first-round match.\n\nOn grass at Wimbledon, Nadal reached the fourth round for the first time but suffered his first loss to Federer in a thrilling five-set epic, 0–6, 6–7(5), 7–6(2), 6–4, 2–6, lasting nearly five hours. Prior to Wimbledon, a left shoulder injury forced him to retire from his Queen's Club quarterfinal against Lleyton Hewitt after winning the first set, but he recovered sufficiently to compete at the All England Club.\n\nNadal's 2006 season concluded with an overall singles record of 56–5, including no losses on clay, and prize money earnings exceeding $3.7 million. His relentless intensity and physical style drew widespread media attention, solidifying his reputation as one of tennis's most formidable young talents.\n\n### 2007: Third French Open title\n\nNadal began the 2007 clay-court season strongly, capturing his third consecutive Monte Carlo Masters title by defeating Roger Federer 6–4, 6–4 in the final. He followed this with victories at the Barcelona Open, defeating Guillermo Cañas 6–3, 6–4, and the Rome Masters, where he beat Fernando González 6–2, 6–2. Nadal then won the Mercedes Cup in Stuttgart, overcoming Stan Wawrinka 6–4, 7–5 in the final. His unbeaten streak on clay, which had reached 81 consecutive matches, was finally broken by Federer in the Hamburg Masters final, where Federer won 6–2, 2–6, 6–0.\n\nEntering the French Open as the two-time defending champion, Nadal extended his dominance at Roland Garros, securing his third straight title without dropping a set until the semifinals. He defeated Novak Djokovic 7–5, 6–4, 6–2 in the semifinals before overcoming Federer 6–3, 4–6, 6–3, 6–4 in the final to claim the championship. This victory marked Nadal's third consecutive French Open title, a feat previously achieved only by Björn Borg in the Open Era.\n\nTransitioning to grass, Nadal reached his first Wimbledon final, defeating Djokovic in the semifinals 3–6, 6–1, 4–6, 7–5, 2–6 before losing to Federer in a five-set epic, 6–7(7), 6–4, 6–7(3), 6–2, 2–6. This appearance established Nadal as a multi-surface contender beyond clay. On hard courts, he won his first Indian Wells Masters title, defeating Novak Djokovic 6–2, 7–5 in the final. At the US Open, however, Nadal's run ended in the fourth round with a loss to David Ferrer 6–7(3), 6–4, 7–6(4), 6–2.\n\nNadal captured six ATP titles in 2007, finishing the year as world No. 2 with a 64–12 win-loss record, an 84% win rate, and earnings of $4.4 million—his first season surpassing $4 million in prize money.\n\n### 2008: Two majors, Olympic singles gold, and world No. 1\n\nNadal secured his fourth consecutive French Open title in 2008, dominating the tournament without dropping a set and culminating in a straight-sets victory over Roger Federer in the final, 6-1, 6-3, 6-0. This marked the third consecutive year that Nadal and Federer met in the Roland Garros final, with Nadal extending his unbeaten streak on clay to 81 matches.\n\nBuilding on his clay-court dominance, Nadal transitioned to grass and claimed his first Wimbledon title, defeating Federer in an epic five-set final delayed by rain over two days, 6-4, 6-4, 6-7(5), 6-7(8), 9-7. The match, lasting nearly five hours and finishing under fading light, is widely regarded as one of the greatest in tennis history and represented Nadal's first major championship outside of clay, achieving back-to-back Grand Slam titles on different surfaces.\n\nAt the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Nadal won the singles gold medal, defeating Chile's Fernando González in the final, 6-3, 7-6(2), 6-3, to claim his first Olympic title. This victory added the Olympic singles gold to his French Open triumphs, marking the first component of what would become his Career Golden Slam.\n\nNadal's Olympic success propelled him to the world No. 1 ranking for the first time on August 18, 2008, ending Roger Federer's record 237-week reign at the top. He maintained the year-end No. 1 position, capping a season in which he won eight ATP titles, including the Chennai Open, Barcelona Open, Hamburg Masters, Queen's Club Championships, Rogers Cup, and Olympic gold alongside his two majors.\n\nAt the US Open, Nadal advanced to the semifinals but fell to Andy Murray in four sets, 6-2, 7-6(5), 4-6, 6-4, in his first appearance at the event as the top seed. The season concluded with Nadal withdrawing from the Paris Masters quarterfinals due to knee tendinitis and subsequently missing the ATP Finals and Davis Cup final because of the injury. Despite the late setback, Nadal's 2008 achievements earned him approximately $6.7 million in prize money and a nomination for the BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year.\n\n### 2009: Australian Open and Davis Cup titles\n\nNadal began 2009 as the world No. 1, entering the Australian Open as the top seed and reaching his first final there after defeating Chile's Fernando González in the semifinals. In the championship match, he overcame Roger Federer in a five-set battle lasting 4 hours and 23 minutes, winning 7–5, 3–6, 7–6(3), 3–6, 6–2 to secure his first hard court major title and second Grand Slam overall. This victory marked Nadal's fifth consecutive win over Federer in major finals and propelled him to a career-high of 12,270 ATP ranking points.\n\nFollowing his Australian Open triumph, Nadal won the Indian Wells Masters in March, defeating Andy Murray 6–1, 6–2 in the final for his second title of the year and 13th Masters 1000 crown. However, knee issues emerged during the clay season; he reached the semifinals in Monte Carlo and Barcelona but withdrew from both due to tendinitis in his knees. At the French Open, Nadal suffered his first loss there since 2004, falling in the fourth round to Sweden's Robin Söderling 6–2, 6–7(2), 6–4, 7–6(2) while visibly hampered by knee pain that limited his movement and topspin-heavy style.\n\nThe knee tendinitis worsened, forcing Nadal to withdraw from Wimbledon on June 19, just days before the tournament, marking the first time a defending champion skipped the event since 1994. He cited ongoing inflammation in both knees, diagnosed after scans revealed fluid buildup and tendon stress, which he attributed to the cumulative strain from his aggressive playing style. At the US Open in August, Nadal returned but struggled with an abdominal muscle injury that began as a minor strain; he advanced to the semifinals before losing to Juan Martín del Potro 2–6, 2–7, 2–6, with the tear expanding to 26 millimeters by the end, severely limiting his serve and groundstrokes.\n\nDespite his physical setbacks, Nadal led Spain to a successful Davis Cup campaign, helping defend their 2008 title with a 5–0 sweep over the Czech Republic in the Barcelona final in December. Playing through knee discomfort, he opened the tie with a 7–5, 6–0, 6–2 victory over Tomáš Berdych and sealed the championship in the dead fifth rubber by defeating Jan Hájek 6–3, 6–4. This marked Spain's fourth Davis Cup win in 10 years and Nadal's second team title contribution.\n\nNadal's 2009 season yielded two titles—the Australian Open and Indian Wells—along with a 66–14 win-loss record, but injuries caused him to drop to world No. 2 by year-end behind Roger Federer. He earned $5.4 million in prize money, reflecting his major and Masters successes amid health challenges. Post-season, Nadal focused on recovery through rest, anti-inflammatory treatments, physiotherapy, and platelet-rich plasma injections for his knees, avoiding surgery and preparing for a 2010 return.\n\n### 2010: Majors on all three surfaces, year-end No. 1, and Career Golden Slam\n\nComing off knee injuries that hampered his 2009 season, Nadal entered 2010 as the defending Australian Open champion but was forced to retire in the quarterfinals against Andy Murray after losing the first two sets 3–6, 6–7(2) and trailing 0–3 in the third due to a recurring right knee issue. Despite the early exit, Nadal regrouped on clay, embarking on a dominant run that included titles at the Monte Carlo Masters, Rome Masters, and Madrid Masters, culminating in his fifth French Open crown. In the Paris final, he defeated Robin Söderling 6–4, 6–2, 6–4 to reclaim the world No. 1 ranking.\n\nTransitioning seamlessly to grass, Nadal captured his third Wimbledon title, overcoming Tomáš Berdych in the final 6–3, 7–5, 6–4 to secure back-to-back victories at the All England Club. His performance on the surface that year underscored his adaptability, as he won all seven matches without dropping a set until the semifinals. On hard courts, Nadal extended his momentum by winning the US Open, his first title there, after a four-set victory over Novak Djokovic in the final, 6–4, 5–7, 6–4, 6–2. This triumph completed the career Grand Slam for Nadal at age 24, making him the youngest man in the Open Era to achieve it and the first to win majors on clay, grass, and hard court in the same calendar year.\n\nNadal's 2010 season marked a pinnacle of versatility, with seven ATP titles overall, including three majors, and a tour-leading win-loss record of 71–10. He clinched the year-end No. 1 ranking for the second time in his career, the first player since Ivan Lendl to regain the top spot after losing it. Earning approximately $8.5 million in prize money, Nadal also ventured into doubles, partnering with compatriot Marc López to win the Indian Wells Masters title, a collaboration that would later contribute to Olympic success. His achievements that year established him as a complete player across surfaces, with only Rod Laver previously winning majors on multiple diverse surfaces in a single season during the pre-Open Era.\n\n### 2011: Sixth French Open title and Davis Cup crown\n\nNadal dominated the clay court season in 2011, securing four consecutive titles that solidified his status as the undisputed king of the surface. He began by capturing his second Monte Carlo Masters title, defeating world No. 1 Novak Djokovic in the final 6-4, 6-3, marking his first win over the Serb that year. Following this, Nadal won the Barcelona Open, overcoming compatriot Nicolás Almagro in the final 6-4, 6-1 for his record sixth title there. He continued his streak at the Madrid Open, again beating Djokovic in the final 7-5, 6-0, and then claimed the Italian Open in Rome, where he edged Djokovic 7-5, 6-3 in another high-stakes final. These victories completed Nadal's career sweep of all four ATP Masters 1000 events on clay, a feat that highlighted his unparalleled mastery on the surface.\n\nAt the French Open, Nadal extended his dominance to claim his sixth title at Roland Garros, extending his winning streak on clay to 37 matches. He did not drop a set until the semifinals, where he defeated Roger Federer 7-5, 6-2, 7-6(3), before overcoming Federer again in the final 7-5, 7-6(3), 5-7, 6-1 to secure the victory. Transitioning to grass, Nadal reached the Wimbledon final for the fourth time, defeating Mardy Fish, Juan Martín del Potro, and Andy Murray en route, but fell to Djokovic 6-4, 6-1, 1-6, 6-3 in a rematch of their Australian Open semifinal from earlier in the year. On hard courts, he advanced to the US Open final after a strong run, including wins over Gilles Simon and Andy Murray, but lost to Djokovic 6-2, 6-4, 6-7(5), 7-5, finishing the year ranked No. 2.\n\nIn the Davis Cup final against Argentina in Seville, Nadal played a pivotal role in Spain's 3-1 victory, their third title in eight years. On the opening day, he defeated Juan Martín del Potro 6-1, 6-4, 6-1, 7-6(7-3) in the second singles rubber, giving Spain a 2-0 lead after Feliciano López's earlier win. Although Argentina pulled one back in doubles, David Ferrer sealed the tie with a straight-sets win over Juan Mónaco the next day. Nadal's performance helped cap a season with five ATP titles overall, though a shoulder injury forced him to withdraw from the Basel Indoor and Paris Masters late in the year. He ended 2011 with a 69-15 win-loss record and earnings of $7,668,214, demonstrating resilience after a challenging hard-court campaign where he won 79% of his matches.\n\n### 2012: Seventh French Open title\n\nNadal dominated the early clay-court season in 2012, securing his seventh Monte Carlo Masters title by defeating world No. 1 Novak Djokovic in the final, 6–2, 6–7(1), 6–3, marking his 47th career ATP singles title. He followed this with a record seventh Barcelona Open Banc Sabadell crown, overcoming compatriot David Ferrer in the final, 7–6(1), 7–5, after saving 12 of 15 break points in a match that lasted over two hours. These victories extended Nadal's unbeaten streak on clay to 34 matches, underscoring his unparalleled mastery of the surface.\n\nAt the French Open, Nadal captured his seventh title at Roland Garros, equaling the all-time men's record, by defeating Djokovic in the final, 6–4, 6–3, 2–6, 7–5, in a rain-delayed match played over two days that lasted four hours and 37 minutes. En route, he dispatched Nicolas Almagro in the quarterfinals, 6–4, 6–3, 6–2, and Ferrer in the semifinals, 6–2, 6–3, 6–2, without dropping a set until the final. This triumph ended a seven-match losing streak to Djokovic and highlighted a pivotal chapter in their storied rivalry. Nadal's performance included a notable 17 consecutive games won against Juan Mónaco in the fourth round, contributing to his 21-match winning streak entering the tournament and extending his overall Roland Garros success to 52 consecutive victories across multiple years.\n\nTransitioning to grass, Nadal's season was derailed by persistent left knee issues at Wimbledon, where he suffered a shocking second-round defeat to No. 100 Lukas Rosol in five sets, 6–7(8), 6–4, 6–4, 2–6, 6–2, marking his earliest exit from the event since 2005. The match exacerbated tendinitis in his knee, forcing him to undergo multiple MRIs during the tournament. Consequently, Nadal withdrew from the 2012 London Olympics on July 19, citing that he was \"not in condition to compete,\" and also skipped the Olympic doubles event with partner Marc López. The injury sidelined him further, leading to his absence from the US Open in August.\n\nDespite the setbacks, Nadal concluded the year ranked No. 4 in the ATP singles rankings, with a 42–6 win-loss record and three titles won exclusively on clay. His on-court earnings for the season totaled approximately $5 million, reflecting the financial impact of his major successes amid the abbreviated campaign.\n\n### 2013: Two majors and return to No. 1\n\nFollowing a seven-month hiatus due to knee tendinitis and other ailments that sidelined him for much of 2012, Nadal returned to competitive play in February 2013, beginning his season on clay in South America. He skipped the Australian Open after withdrawing due to a stomach virus and lingering recovery needs, allowing Novak Djokovic to defend his title unchallenged by Nadal in Melbourne. Nadal quickly regained form, capturing his first title of the year at the Chile Open in Viña del Mar, defeating Horacio Zeballos in the final, followed by a second straight-set victory at the Brasil Open in São Paulo against David Nalbandian.\n\nNadal's clay-court dominance accelerated in the European spring, where he won three ATP Masters 1000 events: Indian Wells (though on hard court, marking his first title there since 2009, beating Del Potro in the final), Madrid (defeating Stan Wawrinka in the final 6–2, 6–4 for his third title at the event), and Barcelona (his eighth title there, over Nicolas Almagro 6–4, 6–3). At the French Open, he secured his eighth Roland Garros title, defeating Novak Djokovic in a four-hour semifinal marathon (6-4, 3-6, 6-1, 6-7(3), 9-7) before overpowering compatriot David Ferrer 6-3, 6-2, 6-3 in the final to claim a record eighth crown at the tournament. His clay-court performance that year was exceptional, with a 59-3 win-loss record, equating to a 95% success rate on the surface.\n\nTransitioning to grass, Nadal experienced an early setback at Wimbledon, where he fell in the first round to unheralded Belgian Steve Darcis 7-6(4), 7-6(8), 6-4, snapping a 22-match winning streak and marking his earliest exit at the event since 2005. Undeterred, he bounced back on hard courts, winning his first grass-court title since 2007 at the Mercedes Cup in Stuttgart, then extending his streak with victories at the Canada Open in Montreal (over Vasek Pospisil) and the Cincinnati Masters (defeating John Isner in the final for a record 26th Masters 1000 crown). These triumphs propelled him into the US Open as the form player, where he claimed his second title there—and fourth major of the hard-court era—by defeating Djokovic in the final 6-2, 3-6, 6-4, 6-1, repeating his 2010 success at Flushing Meadows.\n\nThe 2013 season marked Nadal's most prolific year to date, with 10 titles overall, including two majors and four Masters 1000 events, culminating in his return to the world No. 1 ranking on October 7 after surpassing Djokovic. He finished the year at No. 1, compiling an overall 75-7 record (91.5% win rate) and earning approximately $12 million in prize money, the highest on the ATP Tour that season. A mid-season back strain briefly interrupted his momentum during the North American swing but resolved without long-term impact, allowing him to maintain his rigorous schedule.\n\n### 2014: Ninth French Open title and sustained injuries\n\nNadal entered the 2014 season as the world No. 1, building on the momentum from his two major titles and year-end top ranking in 2013. At the Australian Open, he reached the final but suffered a back injury during his pre-match warm-up, which severely hampered his performance against Stan Wawrinka. Nadal lost the match 6-3, 6-2, 3-6, 6-3, marking Wawrinka's first Grand Slam title and Nadal's earliest exit from Melbourne since 2009. The Spaniard later described the two hours on court as among the most unpleasant of his career due to the escalating pain.\n\nTransitioning to clay courts, Nadal dominated the European swing, securing four titles that year, including victories at the Rio Open, Madrid Open, and French Open. He won the inaugural Rio Open in February by defeating Alexandr Dolgopolov 6-3, 6-4 in the final, extending his clay winning streak. In May, Nadal claimed his fifth Madrid title with a straight-sets victory over Kei Nishikori, marking his 26th Masters 1000 crown. At the French Open, he captured a record-extending ninth title, defeating Novak Djokovic 3-6, 7-5, 6-2, 6-4 in the final after three hours and 31 minutes of intense play under hot conditions. This victory solidified his unparalleled dominance on the surface, where he improved to 66-1 lifetime at Roland Garros.\n\nNadal's grass-court campaign at Wimbledon ended abruptly in the fourth round, where he fell to 19-year-old wildcard Nick Kyrgios in a four-set upset, 7-6(5), 5-7, 7-6(5), 6-3. The loss marked one of the most surprising defeats of Nadal's career, as Kyrgios became the first low-ranked player to upset the world No. 1 at a major since 1992.\n\nInjuries began to mount significantly after Wimbledon, derailing the latter part of his season. A left wrist injury forced Nadal to withdraw from the US Open in August, where he was the defending champion, marking his first absence from the event since 2004. Compounding this, Nadal experienced acute appendicitis during the Shanghai Masters in October, which he played through before undergoing successful surgery on November 3 to remove his appendix. The procedure sidelined him for the remainder of the year, including the ATP World Tour Finals. These setbacks—back issues early on, wrist problems, and appendicitis—caused him to miss several key events and end the season ranked No. 3, his first year outside the top spot since 2011. Despite the challenges, Nadal earned $6,066,446 in prize money, reflecting his strong early-season results.\n\n### 2015: Continued struggles and rankings drop\n\nNadal entered 2015 carrying over injury concerns from the previous year, including knee tendinitis and back issues that had limited his play in 2014, but the season proved challenging primarily due to a dip in form and confidence rather than new major physical setbacks early on. He started strongly by winning his 65th career ATP title at the Argentina Open in Buenos Aires, defeating Juan Mónaco in the final, marking his first title of the year on clay. However, inconsistencies soon emerged, with early-round losses at events like the Miami Open, where he fell in the third round to compatriot Fernando Verdasco amid admitted struggles with nerves and self-doubt. Nadal openly discussed his mental hurdles, stating after the defeat that he was dealing with anxiety and a lack of the usual belief in his game, testing his renowned resilience as he sought to rebuild through focused training and tactical adjustments.\n\nAt the Australian Open, Nadal reached the quarterfinals for the first time since 2014 but was convincingly defeated by Tomáš Berdych 6-2, 6-0, 7-6(4), a result that highlighted ongoing serve and movement issues on hard courts. His clay-court season showed flashes of dominance, culminating in a second title at the MercedesCup in Stuttgart on grass—his first grass-court crown since 2008—where he beat Viktor Troicki in the final, followed by a third title at the Hamburg European Open, overcoming Fabio Fognini. Despite these successes at ATP 250 and 500 levels, Nadal failed to win a Masters 1000 or Grand Slam title for the first time since 2004, underscoring a broader drought in high-stakes events. On the French Open, his signature tournament, he advanced to the quarterfinals but suffered a straight-sets loss to rival Novak Djokovic 7-5, 6-3, 6-1, ending his bid for a record 10th crown and revealing vulnerabilities in baseline rallies.\n\nThe latter half of the year brought further difficulties on faster surfaces. At Wimbledon, Nadal exited in the second round to qualifier Dustin Brown in four sets (7-5, 3-6, 6-4, 6-4), his earliest departure there since 2005 and a shocking upset that amplified questions about his adaptability to grass. A right wrist injury sustained shortly after forced multiple withdrawals, including from the Rogers Cup in Toronto and the Western \\u0026 Southern Open in Cincinnati, sidelining him for key hard-court preparation ahead of the US Open. Returning for the US Open, he reached the third round before falling to Fabio Fognini in five sets (3-6, 4-6, 6-4, 3-6, 6-4), another premature exit that contributed to his season's frustrations. These setbacks, compounded by lingering effects from prior knee, foot, and back problems, led to a year-end ranking of No. 5—his lowest finish since 2005—with an overall win-loss record of 58-19 and earnings of approximately $3.3 million. Despite the trials, Nadal demonstrated mental fortitude by rebounding late in the season, reaching the final of the China Open and advancing to the quarterfinals at both the Basel Indoor and Paris Masters, ending the year on a note of cautious optimism.\n\n### 2016: Olympic doubles gold medal\n\nEntering 2016, Rafael Nadal was ranked No. 5 but continued to battle lingering effects from a foot injury that had hampered his 2015 season, alongside emerging wrist and shoulder issues that would define much of the year. He began the year with a title at the Qatar ExxonMobil Open in Doha, defeating Andy Murray in the final 6-1, 6-2, marking his first ATP title of the season and signaling a partial rebound on hard courts. However, his Australian Open campaign ended abruptly in the first round, where he fell to Fernando Verdasco in five sets, 7-6(6), 4-6, 3-6, 7-6(4), 6-2, his earliest exit at the event since 1998.\n\nNadal's form improved on clay, where he captured two significant titles: the Monte Carlo Masters, defeating Gaël Monfils 7–5, 5–7, 6–0 in the final for his eighth title at the event, and the Barcelona Open, beating Kei Nishikori 6–4, 7–5 to secure his ninth title there and 69th career singles title. These victories, combined with a runner-up finish at the Madrid Open to Murray, showcased his enduring dominance on the surface despite physical challenges. At the French Open, Nadal advanced through the first two rounds with straight-sets wins over Sam Groth (6-1, 6-1, 6-1) and Facundo Bagnis (6-3, 6-0, 6-3), but withdrew before his third-round match against Marcel Granollers due to a left wrist injury, ending his bid for a 10th title at Roland Garros. The same wrist problem forced him to skip Wimbledon entirely, marking his first absence from the tournament since 2004 and limiting his grass-court preparation.\n\nThe Rio Olympics provided Nadal with a highlight amid the adversity, as he partnered with Marc López to win the gold medal in men's doubles, defeating Romania's Florin Mergea and Horia Tecau 6-2, 3-6, 6-4 in the final after two hours and 26 minutes of play. This marked Spain's first Olympic tennis gold since 2008 and Nadal's second career Olympic doubles title, complementing his 2008 singles gold and completing a Career Doubles Golden Slam. In singles, Nadal reached the semifinals, where he lost to Juan Martín del Potro in three sets, 7-6(2), 6-7(6), 6-7(0), before falling to Kei Nishikori 6-2, 6-7(6), 6-3 in the bronze medal match. The doubles triumph, achieved despite the wrist concerns, underscored Nadal's resilience and team synergy with López, a longtime friend and former junior partner.\n\nOverall, Nadal compiled a 39–14 singles win-loss record in 2016, securing three ATP titles and earning approximately $2.8 million in prize money, though a recurrence of the left wrist injury led him to end his season early in October after the China Open. He finished the year ranked No. 9, a modest improvement from his 2015 low of No. 15, reflecting a season of intermittent success punctuated by injury setbacks but capped by Olympic glory.\n\n### 2017: La Décima, third US Open title, and year-end No. 1\n\nRafael Nadal began the 2017 season strongly, reaching the final of the Australian Open, where he was defeated by Roger Federer in five sets, 6-4, 3-6, 6-1, 3-6, 6-3. This marked his first Grand Slam final since 2014 and highlighted his return to form after injury-plagued years.\n\nNadal dominated the clay-court swing, winning his third Monte Carlo Masters title, followed by victories at the Barcelona Open and the Madrid Open, where he secured his fifth title there. These successes propelled him into the French Open as the favorite, where he achieved \"La Décima,\" his record-extending 10th title at Roland Garros, defeating Stan Wawrinka in the final 6-2, 6-3, 6-1 without dropping a set throughout the tournament. At age 31, this victory tied him with Margaret Court for the second-most major titles in Open Era history at the time.\n\nTransitioning to grass, Nadal mounted a second attempt at the Channel Slam—winning both the French Open and Wimbledon—but fell short at the latter, losing in the fourth round to Gilles Müller in a five-set marathon, 3-6, 6-4, 3-6, 4-6, 15-13, after saving 15 match points. He expressed frustration over the narrow defeat but noted the physical toll of the surface.\n\nOn hard courts, Nadal captured his third US Open title—his first since 2010—overwhelming Kevin Anderson in the final 6-3, 6-3, 6-4, bringing his major tally to 16. This performance solidified his resurgence across surfaces. He added two more titles later in the year at the China Open and the Shanghai Masters, totaling six ATP titles for the season.\n\nNadal clinched the year-end world No. 1 ranking for the first time since 2013, securing it with a straight-sets win over Hyeon Chung at the Paris Masters, becoming the oldest man to finish No. 1 at age 31. However, knee discomfort emerged as a concern, particularly in his right knee, leading to withdrawals from the Paris Masters quarterfinals and the ATP Finals after a first-round loss. He managed the issue conservatively, prioritizing long-term health over immediate play.\n\nOverall, Nadal compiled a 67–11 win-loss record, earning approximately $12.2 million in prize money, reflecting his dominant yet physically demanding campaign.\n\n### 2018: 11th French Open and Monte Carlo titles\n\nNadal entered the 2018 season as the world No. 1 but faced immediate challenges with a knee injury sustained during the Australian Open, where he retired in the quarterfinals against Marin Čilić after winning his first four matches. This injury forced him to withdraw from several hard court tournaments, including Indian Wells and Miami, allowing time for recovery before shifting focus to clay.\n\nReturning at the Monte Carlo Masters, Nadal captured a record-extending 11th title, defeating Kei Nishikori 6-3, 6-2 in the final to underline his unparalleled dominance on the surface. He extended this clay-court mastery at the Barcelona Open, securing his 11th title there with a 6-2, 6-1 victory over Stefanos Tsitsipas in the final, becoming the first player to achieve double-digit wins at both events. Nadal continued his streak by winning the Italian Open in Rome for an eighth time, beating Alexander Zverev 6-1, 1-6, 6-1 in the championship match, completing a flawless run through the European clay Masters.\n\nAt the French Open, Nadal claimed his 11th title and 17th major overall, overpowering Dominic Thiem 6-4, 6-3, 6-2 in the final to extend his perfect record in Roland Garros finals. Persistent knee issues led to his withdrawal from Wimbledon prior to the tournament, but he rebounded on hard courts by winning the Rogers Cup in Toronto, defeating Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-2, 7-6(4) in the final for his fifth title of the year. Nadal reached the quarterfinals at the US Open, where he fell to Novak Djokovic 6-0, 4-6, 6-4, 1-6, 7-5, before abdominal discomfort sidelined him for the Paris Masters and ATP Finals. Despite these setbacks, Nadal finished the year as world No. 2 in the ATP rankings, having won five titles and earned $8,663,347 in prize money.\n\n### 2019: Fourth French-US title double, Davis Cup, and year-end No. 1\n\nNadal began the 2019 season at the Australian Open, where he reached his third final at the tournament but fell to world No. 1 Novak Djokovic in straight sets, 6–3, 6–2, 6–3. This marked Nadal's first Grand Slam final loss since 2014 and highlighted Djokovic's dominance on hard courts early in the year.\n\nTransitioning to clay, Nadal skipped several early events to manage his schedule but delivered a dominant spring season, winning 23 of 24 matches for a 95.8% win rate on the surface. He captured his ninth Italian Open title in Rome, defeating Novak Djokovic 6–0, 4–6, 6–1 in the final to secure his first title of the year and extend his record for most Masters 1000 crowns to 34. At the French Open, Nadal claimed his record-extending 12th title, overcoming Dominic Thiem 6–3, 5–7, 6–1, 6–1 in the final after dropping just one set across the tournament. This victory improved his head-to-head against Thiem to 5–2, underscoring their growing rivalry on clay. The win brought his all-time Roland Garros match record to 93–2.\n\nOn hard courts, Nadal won the Canada Open in Montreal for his fourth title there, beating Daniil Medvedev in the final, before a quarterfinal exit at the US Open seemed possible but turned into triumph. In New York, he secured his fourth US Open crown—and second of the calendar year—edging Medvedev 7–5, 6–3, 5–7, 4–6, 6–4 in a five-set epic lasting nearly five hours, marking his 19th major title overall. This French-US double was Nadal's fourth such achievement in a single season.\n\nIn November, Nadal led Spain to victory in the inaugural Davis Cup Finals in the revamped format held in Madrid, winning all four of his matches—two singles and two doubles—to clinch the title against Canada 2–0 in the final, with a 6–3, 7–6(7) win over Denis Shapovalov sealing Spain's sixth Davis Cup crown. Nadal's undefeated run across eight rubbers in the event highlighted his leadership and versatility in team competition.\n\nNadal won four ATP titles in 2019 alongside the Davis Cup, finishing the year with a 58–7 overall record and reclaiming the year-end No. 1 ranking for the third time in his career. He earned a tour-leading $16,349,586 in prize money. Late in the season, an abdominal injury forced his withdrawal from the Paris Masters semifinals and sidelined him for the ATP Finals, though he recovered in time for the Davis Cup triumph.\n\n### 2020: 13th French Open title\n\nThe 2020 ATP Tour season was profoundly disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, with play suspended from mid-March until late July, leading to the relocation and postponement of numerous events, including the French Open from its traditional May-June slot to late September through early October. Nadal began the year strongly, reaching the quarterfinals at the Australian Open in January, where he fell to Dominic Thiem in a tight four-set match, 7-6(1), 7-6(4), 4-6, 6-7(6). His only title before the shutdown came at the Acapulco Open in February, where he defeated Taylor Fritz 6-3, 6-2 in the final to claim his 85th career ATP singles trophy.\n\nUpon the tour's resumption, Nadal opted out of the US Open citing pandemic-related health risks, while Wimbledon was canceled outright. He competed in the Western \\u0026 Southern Open, which was relocated to Flushing Meadows in New York as a US Open precursor, but exited in the second round with a 5-7, 3-6 loss to Diego Schwartzman. The season's pinnacle arrived at the rescheduled French Open, where Nadal secured a record-extending 13th title—the first ever played in October—by overpowering world No. 1 Novak Djokovic 6-0, 6-2, 7-5 in the final, a victory that tied Roger Federer's men's record of 20 Grand Slam singles titles.\n\nThe French Open operated under rigorous COVID-19 protocols, including a bio-secure bubble at Roland Garros with mandatory testing, restricted player movement, and limited access to ensure safety amid rising cases in Europe. Nadal navigated a minor physical setback following the extended lockdown, admitting that his body required time to readjust after months of limited training in Spain, though it proved inconsequential to his dominant run on clay. In a truncated calendar with just one major contested, Nadal compiled a 27-7 win-loss record and earned $3,422,202 in prize money, finishing the year at No. 2 in the ATP rankings for the seventh time in his career.\n\n### 2021: 12th Barcelona Open and 10th Italian Open titles, and injury-shortened season\n\nNadal began the 2021 season strongly at the Australian Open, advancing to the quarterfinals before falling to Stefanos Tsitsipas in a five-set marathon, 3-6, 2-6, 7-6(4), 6-4, 7-5. Despite dealing with a foot blister during the tournament, he showed resilience on hard courts early in the year. Following this, Nadal captured his first title of the season at the ATP 250 event in Melbourne, defeating Jordan Thompson in the final, marking his return to form after a limited 2020.\n\nTransitioning to clay, Nadal dominated the European swing, securing four titles overall but particularly excelling at his favored events. At the Monte Carlo Masters, he claimed his 11th title there with a straight-sets victory over Andrey Rublev in the final. He then extended his record at the Barcelona Open Banc Sabadell, winning a 12th championship by saving a match point against Tsitsipas in the final, 6-4, 6-7(6), 7-5, on the court named in his honor. This victory underscored his unparalleled mastery on the surface, bringing his career clay titles to 59. Culminating the clay preparation, Nadal lifted a record-extending 10th Italian Open trophy in Rome, overcoming longtime rival Novak Djokovic 7-5, 1-6, 6-3 in the final after a grueling battle featuring 26 forehand winners. These successes positioned him as the favorite entering the French Open.\n\nAt Roland Garros, Nadal reached the semifinals but suffered a straight-sets defeat to Djokovic, 3-6, 6-3, 7-6(4), 6-2, hampered by escalating pain in his left foot. Post-match, he disclosed suffering from Müller-Weiss syndrome, a chronic degenerative condition affecting the navicular bone that had flared up during the tournament, forcing him to play through numbness via injections. The injury, which originated in childhood but intensified in 2021, led to his withdrawal from Wimbledon and the Tokyo Olympics in June to prioritize recovery.\n\nThe foot issue persisted, causing Nadal to skip the US Open and end his season prematurely in August after a brief return at the Citi Open. He underwent surgery on his left foot in late August to address the chronic problem. Overall, Nadal won four titles that year, finished at world No. 6 in the year-end rankings, compiled a 24-5 win-loss record on the ATP Tour, and earned approximately $1.48 million in prize money.\n\n### 2022: 21st and 22nd majors, and double Career Grand Slam\n\nNadal began the 2022 season strongly, building on his recovery from the foot injury that had plagued him in 2021. He won his first title of the year at the ATP 250 event in Melbourne, defeating Maxime Cressy in the final, and followed it with a victory at the ATP 500 tournament in Acapulco, where he beat Félix Auger-Aliassime. These successes propelled him into the Australian Open as the second seed, where he captured his second title there and 21st major overall. In the final, Nadal staged a remarkable comeback against Daniil Medvedev, losing the first two sets before winning 2–6, 6–7(5–7), 6–4, 6–4, 7–5 to secure the victory after nearly five and a half hours on court. This triumph marked his first Australian Open win since 2009 and elevated him to the top of the all-time men's Grand Slam titles list, surpassing Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic temporarily.\n\nDespite ongoing discomfort from his chronic left foot condition, Müller-Weiss syndrome—a rare degenerative disorder affecting the navicular bone that Nadal had managed since his teens—Nadal continued his momentum on clay. He received painkilling injections during the French Open to compete, extending his unbeaten streak on the surface to 112 matches before the semifinals. In the final, he dominated Casper Ruud 6–3, 6–3, 6–0, claiming his record-extending 14th Roland Garros title and 22nd major overall. This victory completed Nadal's double Career Grand Slam, as he had now won each of the four majors at least twice: two Australian Opens, 14 French Opens, two Wimbledons, and four US Opens. The achievement underscored his versatility across surfaces, with the French Open win coming just months after his hard-court success in Melbourne.\n\nNadal's grass-court campaign at Wimbledon was derailed by an abdominal injury. He advanced to the quarterfinals with gritty wins, including a five-set epic against Taylor Fritz (3–6, 7–5, 6–3, 5–7, 7–6(4)) where he played through pain, but a 7mm tear in his abdominal muscle forced his withdrawal before the semifinal against Nick Kyrgios. At the US Open, Nadal reached the fourth round before falling to Frances Tiafoe 6–4, 4–6, 6–4, 6–3, ending his bid for a calendar-year double. Additional setbacks included a cracked rib sustained during the Indian Wells final loss to Taylor Fritz earlier in the year. These injuries, compounded by the progression of his foot condition, limited his late-season play.\n\nOverall, Nadal compiled a 39–8 win-loss record on the ATP Tour, securing four titles—all on hard courts except the French Open—and earning approximately $9.37 million in prize money. He finished the year ranked world No. 2, behind Carlos Alcaraz, capping a season defined by historic major triumphs amid persistent physical challenges.\n\n### 2023: Injury struggles and exit from Top 10 after 18 consecutive years\n\nFollowing the triumphs of 2022, in which Nadal secured his 21st and 22nd Grand Slam titles at the Australian Open and French Open, the Spaniard entered 2023 grappling with persistent physical challenges that severely limited his participation.\n\nNadal's season began at the Australian Open, where he defeated Jack Draper in the first round but suffered a 4-6, 4-6, 5-7 loss to Mackenzie McDonald in the second round on January 18, during which he sustained a grade 2 injury to his left iliopsoas muscle. The injury, confirmed by MRI, forced him to withdraw from subsequent events including the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells and the Miami Open in late February.\n\nThe hip issue persisted, leading to further absences from key clay-court tournaments such as the Monte Carlo Masters, Barcelona Open, Mutua Madrid Open, and Internazionali BNL d'Italia. On May 18, Nadal withdrew from the French Open, his record 14-time venue, citing ongoing recovery challenges and expressing disappointment at missing the event for the first time since 2004. He underwent successful arthroscopic surgery on his left psoas muscle on June 2 in Barcelona, with an expected recovery of five months that sidelined him for the remainder of the season.\n\nNadal also pulled out of Wimbledon, the Western \\u0026 Southern Open in Cincinnati, and the US Open, marking his most limited year on the ATP Tour with just two matches played—a 1-1 win-loss record and no titles captured. Due to inactivity, his ranking plummeted to No. 664 by year-end, ending an extraordinary 912-week streak in the ATP top 10 that had begun in April 2005, the longest in history.\n\nThroughout the year, Nadal voiced deep frustration over the injury's toll, admitting in January that the setbacks had left him \"destroyed mentally\" after battling through pain to complete his Australian Open match rather than retire. By May, upon the French Open withdrawal, he indicated that 2024 would likely be his final season on tour, though he later reflected with gratitude on his achievements despite the obstacles.\n\n### 2024: Return to the tour and retirement\n\nNadal began his 2024 campaign with a return to competitive play at the Brisbane International after nearly a year sidelined by injuries. He advanced to the quarterfinals, defeating Dominic Thiem in the first round 7-5, 6-1 and Jason Kubler in the second 6-1, 6-2, before falling to Jordan Thompson 1-6, 6-4, 7-6(8). A hip injury sustained during the event forced him to withdraw from the Australian Open, marking another setback in his recovery from 2023 ailments.\n\nNadal resumed competition on clay in April at the Barcelona Open, where he secured a straight-sets victory over Flavio Cobolli in the first round before losing to Alex de Minaur 7-5, 6-1 in the second. He then competed at the Mutua Madrid Open, reaching the round of 16 with wins over Alex de Minaur 7-6(5), 6-3 and Pedro Cachin in a three-hour marathon 6-1, 2-6, 6-4, only to be defeated by Jiri Lehecka 7-5, 6-4. At the Italian Open in Rome, Nadal won his opening match against Zizou Bergs 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 but exited in the second round to Hubert Hurkacz 6-1, 6-3. His French Open campaign, potentially his last at Roland Garros, ended in the first round with a 6-3, 7-6(5), 6-3 loss to fourth seed Alexander Zverev, snapping Nadal's perfect 112-4 record at the tournament in best-of-five sets. Persistent hip issues led to withdrawals from Wimbledon and the US Open.\n\nIn July, Nadal served as a torchbearer for the Paris Olympics, carrying the flame through the Roland Garros grounds. In singles, he defeated Marton Fucsovics 6-1, 4-6, 6-4 in the first round but lost to long-time rival Novak Djokovic 6-1, 6-4 in the second, their 60th career meeting. Partnering with Carlos Alcaraz in doubles, the Spanish duo advanced to the quarterfinals with victories over Argentine and Dutch pairs before falling 6-2, 6-4 to Americans Austin Krajicek and Rajeev Ram. Nadal's final tournament was the Nordea Open in Bastad, where he reached his first ATP final since 2022, defeating Leo Borg, Stefan Kostić, Mariano Navone in a four-hour quarterfinal, and Rafael Nadal Open opponent Filip Misolic, but lost to Nuno Borges 6-3, 6-2 in the championship match.\n\nOn October 10, 2024, Nadal announced his retirement from professional tennis, stating that the Davis Cup Finals in Málaga would mark the end of his career after two decades on the tour. Representing Spain in the Davis Cup quarterfinals against the Netherlands on November 19, Nadal played his last professional match, a 6-4, 6-4 singles defeat to Botic van de Zandschulp, as Spain was eliminated from the competition. The year yielded no major titles for Nadal, who compiled a 12-8 singles record across eight events. His farewell drew widespread tributes from peers, including Roger Federer, who called him \"one of the greatest,\" and Novak Djokovic, who praised his \"unbelievable legacy\" and warrior spirit.\n\n## Rivalries\n\n### With Roger Federer\n\nThe rivalry between Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer is widely regarded as one of the most iconic in tennis history, characterized by their contrasting styles and intense competition across 40 professional matches from 2004 to 2019. Nadal holds the overall head-to-head advantage with 24 victories to Federer's 16. On clay, Nadal dominated with a 14–2 record, reflecting his unparalleled prowess on the surface, while on grass and hard courts combined, Federer led 14–10. Their encounters spanned all major surfaces and included 14 Grand Slam matches, eight of which were finals, where Nadal prevailed in five.\n\nThe stylistic contrast between the two players—Federer's fluid elegance and precision against Nadal's raw power and relentless topspin—captivated audiences and elevated the sport's aesthetic appeal. Federer's game emphasized graceful footwork, a one-handed backhand, and aggressive net play, often producing balletic rallies, whereas Nadal's heavy forehand spin, defensive baseline grinding, and explosive athleticism created a \"warrior\" intensity that challenged Federer's finesse. Nadal himself highlighted this dynamic, noting that the \"elegance versus warrior\" matchup made their rivalry particularly revered compared to others. This clash not only produced some of the longest and most dramatic matches in the Open Era but also influenced how subsequent players approached versatility across surfaces.\n\nSeveral matches stand out as pivotal in their rivalry, showcasing high-stakes drama and mutual respect. In the 2007 French Open semifinals, Nadal defeated Federer 3–6, 6–3, 6–1, 4–6, 6–2, extending his clay dominance and preventing Federer from achieving a first French title. The 2008 Wimbledon final was an epic five-set battle lasting nearly five hours, with Nadal winning 6–4, 6–4, 6–7(5), 6–7(8), 9–7 in deteriorating light, ending Federer's five-year reign at the All England Club and marking the first Wimbledon final for Nadal. Their 2009 Australian Open final saw Nadal triumph 7–5, 3–6, 7–6(3), 3–6, 6–2, securing his first hard-court major and further solidifying his status as a threat on all surfaces despite injury concerns. These encounters, among others, highlighted the rivalry's evolution from clay supremacy to balanced competition on faster courts.\n\nOff the court, Federer and Nadal developed a close friendship that transcended their on-court battles, collaborating in team events and exhibitions. They teamed up for Team Europe at the Laver Cup multiple times, including in 2017 and 2019, fostering camaraderie among the \"Big Four.\" Federer's retirement in 2022 culminated in an emotional doubles match at the Laver Cup in London, where he and Nadal lost to Team World's Jack Sock and Frances Tiafoe 4–6, 7–6(2), 11–9; the pair's visible tears during the post-match ceremony underscored their bond, with Nadal later describing Federer as a key influence in his career. This partnership extended to charitable exhibitions under the \"Fedal\" banner, such as the 2016 Match for Africa and the 2020 Cape Town showdown, which drew massive crowds and raised funds for their foundations.\n\nThe Federer-Nadal rivalry significantly boosted tennis's global popularity, drawing new fans through its narrative of contrasting artistry and grit, often credited with expanding the sport's reach beyond traditional audiences. Their matches, including the 2008 Wimbledon final, generated record viewership and media coverage, while \"Fedal\" exhibitions like the South American tour in 2016 attracted over 50,000 spectators per event, blending competition with entertainment to promote philanthropy. This duo's influence helped sustain the men's game's prominence during the late 2000s and 2010s, inspiring a generation of players and solidifying tennis as a showcase for personal rivalries.\n\n### With Novak Djokovic\n\nThe rivalry between Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic is one of the most intense and enduring in tennis history, spanning 18 years and featuring 60 professional matches, the most between any two players in the Open Era. Djokovic holds the overall head-to-head advantage at 31–29, with a 15–6 record on hard courts, while Nadal leads 22–9 on clay and Djokovic leads 6–2 on grass. Their encounters began at the 2006 French Open, where Nadal won in straight sets, and concluded at the 2024 Paris Olympics, also on clay at Roland Garros, with Djokovic prevailing 6–1, 6–4 in the second round.\n\nBoth players are renowned baseline competitors, relying on powerful groundstrokes, exceptional defense, and physical endurance to outlast opponents in grueling rallies, which often defined their matches as attritional battles of attrition rather than stark stylistic contrasts. This shared grinding style led to some of the longest matches in tournament history, including their 2012 Australian Open final, which lasted five hours and 53 minutes over two days. Nadal's topspin-heavy forehand and court coverage complemented Djokovic's elastic flexibility and return game, creating parity that saw the lead change hands multiple times, with Djokovic pulling ahead decisively in later years on faster surfaces.\n\nThey met six times in Grand Slam finals, with Djokovic winning four and Nadal two (both at the French Open), contributing to a broader 11–7 edge for Nadal in all major matches. Iconic clashes include the 2011 US Open final, where Djokovic came back from two sets to one down to win his first title there 6–2, 6–4, 6–7(5), 6–1, denying Nadal a career Grand Slam; the 2013 US Open final, Nadal's response with a 6–2, 3–6, 6–4, 6–1 victory for his second crown; and the 2022 French Open final, Nadal's 13th at the tournament, edging Djokovic 6–3, 6–3, 6–0 in a one-sided affair despite Nadal's injury concerns. Other pivotal encounters occurred in Davis Cup ties, such as Nadal's 2019 win in Madrid that helped Spain reach the final.\n\nThroughout their rivalry, mutual respect was evident, with both players frequently praising each other's resilience and sportsmanship in post-match interviews; Djokovic called Nadal \"one of the greatest fighters ever\" after their 2022 Roland Garros meeting, while Nadal described Djokovic as \"an amazing rival\" following their final Olympic clash. This dynamic not only elevated individual performances but also defined the Big Three era, pushing records for longevity, titles, and weeks at No. 1, as their competition spurred innovation in training and mental preparation across the sport.\n\n## Player profile\n\n### Playing style\n\nRafael Nadal's playing style is characterized by a powerful baseline game dominated by his signature left-handed forehand, which generates exceptional topspin through an extreme semi-western grip and a looping, lasso-like swing path. This shot, often clocked at an average of 3,200 revolutions per minute (RPM) and peaking above 5,000 RPM, creates high-bouncing trajectories that are particularly devastating on clay, forcing opponents into defensive positions and exploiting his natural lefty angle. His forehand's combination of speed, spin, and precision has been described as one of the most feared weapons in tennis history, enabling him to control rallies from the back of the court.\n\nComplementing his baseline prowess, Nadal's physicality sets him apart, with elite speed, endurance, and agility allowing him to cover the court relentlessly and retrieve seemingly impossible balls. His tireless movement, honed through rigorous training, supports extended rallies—often exceeding 20 shots—where he wears down opponents, while his use of drop shots, particularly from the forehand side, adds variety and disrupts aggressive play. Although renowned as a clay specialist with a 90% win rate on the surface, Nadal adapted his heavy topspin game to faster hard courts and grass, securing titles across all surfaces and achieving a Career Grand Slam.\n\nNadal's serve, while not reliant on raw power, evolved significantly over his career into a reliable weapon, with improved placement and second-serve effectiveness rising from 56% points won in 2007 to over 60% by 2008, peaking at 90.8% service games held in 2019. His return of serve is aggressively proactive, often struck from deep behind the baseline to neutralize big servers and initiate baseline dominance, winning 15% more return points on clay than on other surfaces.\n\nEarly in his career, Nadal's two-handed backhand was a relative vulnerability, prone to errors under pressure and less offensive than his forehand, but he refined it over time—taking it earlier and adding slice variety—to eliminate weaknesses, as seen in his 2013 US Open triumph. The intensity of his spin-heavy, physical style has also made him injury-prone, contributing to recurring issues in his knees, feet, and hips due to the stress of constant sliding and high-impact retrievals.\n\nNadal's game evolved post-2008, particularly after his Wimbledon breakthrough, with enhancements in serve, net approaches, and overall aggression to conquer faster surfaces, shifting from pure defense to proactive point construction while maintaining baseline consistency. His clay-court dominance, marked by 81 consecutive wins from 2005-2007, draws comparisons to Bjorn Borg, whose six French Open titles and 46-match streak highlighted similar endurance and topspin mastery, though Nadal's record-breaking 14 Roland Garros triumphs surpass Borg's in volume and win percentage.\n\n### Attitude and demeanor\n\nRafael Nadal is renowned for his fierce competitiveness on the court, embodying a \"never give up\" mentality that has defined his career. He approaches every point with unrelenting intensity, refusing to concede even seemingly lost causes, which has led to numerous dramatic victories. This warrior-like determination stems from his belief in perseverance, as highlighted in analyses of his playing style where he treats each rally as a battle to be won through sheer will.\n\nNadal's on-court demeanor balances this intensity with humility and respect toward opponents, often manifested through his signature rituals, such as meticulously adjusting his shirt, cap, and shorts before serves to maintain focus and composure. These habits, while ritualistic, underscore his disciplined and respectful approach, ensuring he remains grounded amid high-stakes matches. His sportsmanship is evident in how he acknowledges rivals' efforts, rarely engaging in unsportsmanlike conduct, which has earned him widespread admiration. Off the court, this translates to a shy and polite personality, contrasting sharply with his on-court ferocity; early in his career, he faced criticism for his loud grunting, which some opponents like Roger Federer found distracting, but it has since been accepted as an integral part of his natural playing rhythm.\n\nNadal's mental toughness shines in pressure-packed situations, exemplified by his epic 2022 Australian Open comeback from two sets to love down against Daniil Medvedev to claim his 21st major title, a victory he described as one of the most unexpected of his career. Over time, he has evolved into a more vocal figure, particularly in later years, offering candid insights in interviews and mentoring younger players on resilience and humility. This growth has amplified his influence, inspiring the next generation with his example of handling adversity without complaint. His exemplary conduct has been recognized through multiple Stefan Edberg Sportsmanship Awards from the ATP, winning in 2010, 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021, honoring his professionalism and integrity.\n\n### Coaching and personal team\n\nRafael Nadal's first and most influential coach was his uncle Toni Nadal, who began training him at age four in 1990 and served in that role until the end of the 2017 season. Toni emphasized a defensive playing approach and instilled values of humility and mental toughness, guiding Nadal through the early stages of his professional career and contributing to his development as a 16-time Grand Slam singles champion during that period. Their partnership, marked by a family-oriented dynamic, ended amicably as Toni transitioned away from full-time coaching to allow Nadal to evolve independently.\n\nFollowing Toni's departure, Carlos Moyá joined Nadal's team as primary coach at the start of the 2017 ATP Tour season, a role he held through Nadal's retirement in 2024. Moyá, a former World No. 1 and fellow Mallorcan, brought strategic insights from his own career, helping Nadal secure additional major titles, including the 2022 Australian Open. Francis Roig, who had been part of the team since 2005, provided technical support until departing at the end of 2022 to pursue independent coaching projects after 18 years of collaboration. Marc López, a former doubles partner and Olympic gold medalist with Nadal in 2016, joined the coaching staff in December 2021, offering tactical expertise from his doubles background.\n\nIn late 2022, amid ongoing injury challenges, Nadal added Gustavo Marcaccio to his technical team; Marcaccio, a coach from the Rafa Nadal Academy, focused on rehabilitation and performance optimization during Nadal's recovery periods. This adjustment reflected a broader evolution in the team's composition, initially lacking a single full-time head coach post-Toni but gradually incorporating specialized roles for physical and mental resilience.\n\nNadal's support staff has long included physiotherapist Rafael Maymó, who joined in 2006 and managed his extensive injury history through customized recovery programs, including treatments for chronic foot issues and rib stress fractures. The team's structure has been notably family-integrated, with relatives like Toni providing foundational guidance and the group functioning as a close-knit unit to support Nadal's demanding schedule. Later in his career, involvement from academy staff like Marcaccio further blended professional and institutional resources, enhancing injury management and preparation.\n\n### Equipment and apparel\n\nRafael Nadal has utilized Babolat rackets exclusively since turning professional in 2001, endorsing the Pure Aero line, which succeeded the AeroPro Drive model he first adopted. His actual playing racket is a customized version based on the 2005 AeroPro Drive mold, repainted with the modern Pure Aero cosmetic for sponsorship consistency, featuring a 100 square inch head size, unstrung weight of 300 grams (10.6 ounces), balance point of 320 mm, and stiffness rating of 72 RA. The 16x19 string pattern and left-handed setup, despite Nadal being naturally right-handed, allow for enhanced topspin generation that complements his aggressive baseline style.\n\nNadal strings his racket with Babolat RPM Blast, a shaped polyester monofilament in 1.35 mm gauge, tensioned at approximately 55 pounds (25 kg), prioritizing durability and spin over comfort to suit his high-intensity groundstrokes. He uses a grip size of 4 1/4 inches (L2), customized with an overgrip for added control and moisture absorption during extended rallies.\n\nSince signing with Nike in 1997 at age 11, Nadal's apparel has featured the brand's performance line, often including sleeveless tops for mobility, compression shorts, and a cap emblazoned with the Nike swoosh alongside a bull logo symbolizing his Mallorcan roots. His on-court colors evolve seasonally but maintain a bold, vibrant palette, with fabrics like Dri-FIT for sweat-wicking and breathability.\n\nFor footwear, Nadal wears Nike's Zoom Vapor Cage series, such as the Cage 4 Rafa model, engineered with a reinforced cage upper for lateral stability and a durable rubber outsole suited to clay surfaces, helping mitigate injury risks from his explosive movement.\n\nOver his career, racket specifications have seen minimal structural changes beyond cosmetic updates to align with Babolat's Pure Aero iterations, maintaining the 100 square inch head for consistency in feel and power. Nadal incorporates superstitions into his gear routines, such as meticulously adjusting his shorts before serves to ensure they sit symmetrically, a habit rooted in his focus on mental preparation.\n\n## Legacy\n\n### Tennis achievements and influence\n\nRafael Nadal's tennis career is defined by extraordinary statistical dominance, culminating in 22 Grand Slam singles titles, the second-most in men's history. He holds the outright record with 14 victories at the French Open (Roland Garros), where he never lost a final, alongside four US Open titles, two Australian Open crowns, and two Wimbledon championships, achieving a Career Grand Slam.\n\nBeyond majors, Nadal amassed 92 ATP Tour singles titles, ranking him among the all-time elite, including a record-tying 36 Masters 1000 crowns that underscored his versatility across surfaces. His Olympic success further elevated his legacy, securing gold medals in singles at the 2008 Beijing Games—defeating Fernando González in the final—and in doubles with Marc López at the 2016 Rio Olympics.\n\nAs part of the iconic Big Three alongside Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic, Nadal contributed to their collective 66 Grand Slam titles from 2003 to 2023, a period that reshaped men's tennis by emphasizing relentless baseline power and endurance, inspiring a generation of players to adopt aggressive, high-intensity styles.\n\nNadal's influence extended profoundly to clay-court tennis, where his topspin-heavy forehand and exceptional sliding revolutionized defensive play into an offensive weapon, extending rallies and forcing opponents to adapt to prolonged physical battles on the surface. He spent 209 weeks at world No. 1, tying for fifth all-time, and became the youngest man in the Open Era to complete the Career Grand Slam at age 24 by winning the 2010 US Open.\n\nThrough the Rafa Nadal Academy, founded in 2016 in Manacor, Spain, he has mentored emerging talents, including Carlos Alcaraz, who trained there from age 15 and credits Nadal's guidance for his rapid rise to multiple Grand Slam wins. Following his 2024 retirement, Nadal has hinted at a future mentorship role, expressing openness to coaching top players while focusing on his academy's development of the next generation.\n\n### Cultural and social impact\n\nRafael Nadal's dominance on clay courts has cemented his status as the \"King of Clay,\" a nickname reflecting his record 14 French Open titles and unparalleled success on the surface, which has become synonymous with his legacy in tennis history. This iconic persona extends beyond the sport, inspiring global admiration for his tenacity and style, as explored in documentaries like the 2014 film *Nadal: The Secrets of a Giant*, which delves into the personal and professional elements that shaped his rise.\n\nBorn into a middle-class family in Manacor, Mallorca, Nadal embodies the archetype of a self-made hero, rising from island roots to international stardom through relentless effort and humility, qualities that resonate deeply with fans as a model of perseverance. His story motivates underprivileged youth worldwide, particularly through the Rafa Nadal Foundation, which uses sports to foster personal development and education for disadvantaged children in Spain and India, providing scholarships and programs that emphasize resilience and opportunity. Nadal's advocacy for gender equality in tennis further amplifies his inspirational role; he has publicly supported equal access and opportunities for women in the sport, arguing that compensation should align with generated interest while promoting fairness overall. His portrayal as a devoted family man, often sharing moments with his wife, sons, and extended relatives, reinforces this accessible image, humanizing him amid his athletic achievements.\n\nNadal's cultural footprint spans continents, with a fervent fanbase in Spain—where he is a national symbol of pride—and Latin America, where his Latin heritage and exhibition tours have drawn massive crowds, such as thousands greeting him in Chile during a 2022 visit. As an ambassador for initiatives promoting sport's role in development, including partnerships with organizations like UNESCO, he leverages his platform to advance social inclusion and youth empowerment globally. Following his retirement in November 2024, Nadal has focused on expanding the Rafa Nadal Academy network, opening a new facility in Marbella in 2025 and exploring further international outposts to nurture emerging talent.\n\nThroughout his career, Nadal faced criticisms, including unsubstantiated doping suspicions during the 2010s, particularly around injury absences and physical transformation; however, he was repeatedly cleared, never failing a drug test or receiving a suspension from the International Tennis Federation. These allegations, often fueled by rivals or media, did little to tarnish his reputation, as his clean record and legal actions against accusers underscored his commitment to integrity. His philanthropic efforts, tied to the foundation's work with vulnerable communities, continue to highlight his broader social contributions post-retirement.\n\n## Off the court\n\n### In popular culture\n\nRafael Nadal has been prominently featured in documentary series that highlight his tennis career and personal challenges. The Netflix series *Break Point* (2023) includes multiple episodes centered on Nadal, such as \"King of Clay,\" which chronicles his rivalry with Casper Ruud at the 2022 French Open, and \"Under Pressure,\" focusing on Frances Tiafoe's 2022 US Open upset over him. Additionally, the 2024 Netflix docuseries *Rafa* provides an in-depth look at Nadal's final season, legacy, and reflections on his 22 Grand Slam titles.\n\nNadal's autobiography, *Rafa: My Story* (2011), co-written with journalist John Carlin, offers insights into his upbringing, training under uncle Toni Nadal, and mental approach to the sport, becoming a bestseller that reveals the discipline behind his success.\n\nIn video games, Nadal appears as a playable character in the *Top Spin* series, including *Top Spin 4* (2011), where his signature topspin forehand and playing style are replicated for virtual matches. His intense on-court demeanor, particularly his grunting, has inspired memes and viral content, such as the ATP Tour's \"Guess the Grunt\" challenge video that highlights his distinctive vocalizations during play.\n\nNadal participated in high-profile exhibition events, notably the 2024 Six Kings Slam in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, where he competed against Novak Djokovic, Carlos Alcaraz, and others in a team-format tournament, marking one of his final competitive appearances before retirement.\n\nCultural tributes include statues honoring Nadal in his hometown of Manacor, Mallorca, such as the 2023 bronze sculpture at the Rafa Nadal Academy depicting his iconic French Open victory pose, and a replica of the Roland Garros statue unveiled there in 2023. He has also been referenced in music, including the indie track \"Rafael\" (2014) by South African band Beatenberg, which pays homage to his tennis prowess and resilience, and \"Vamos Rafa\" (2014), a fan-dedicated song celebrating his career.\n\n### Philanthropy\n\nRafael Nadal co-founded the Fundación Rafa Nadal in 2010 with his mother, Ana María Parera, to leverage sport and education as tools for social transformation and equal opportunities among disadvantaged youth. The organization focuses on vulnerable children and young people, integrating tennis programs with academic support, psychosocial care, and values education to promote personal growth and inclusion. Operating primarily in Spain through centers in Palma de Mallorca, Valencia, and Madrid, the foundation extends its reach to rural India via the NETS (Nadal Educational Tennis School) initiative and to Latin America through partnerships.\n\nCentral to the foundation's efforts is the Study\\u0026Play scholarship program, launched in 2015, which provides holistic support—including sports training, schooling, and emotional development—to over 1,000 beneficiaries annually across its projects. Additional programs like More Than Tennis offer inclusive tennis for individuals with intellectual disabilities in Spain, while the Play All initiative delivers accessible sports to at-risk minors. These efforts align with UN Sustainable Development Goals, emphasizing long-term impact over short-term aid, with annual events such as the Rafa Nadal Tour youth circuit raising funds while instilling discipline and teamwork. The foundation's international galas, including the Paris International Gala and the ongoing Rafa Nadal Foundation Awards, have generated millions in donations to sustain scholarships and expand access.\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 crisis in 2020, Nadal partnered with Pau Gasol to launch a national fundraising campaign in Spain, securing €11 million to support 1.35 million affected individuals through medical equipment like ventilators, financial aid for families, and resources for frontline workers. The foundation complemented this by distributing tablets, school kits, and psychosocial support to children facing educational disruptions in its centers, ensuring continuity of learning during lockdowns. Nadal also made personal donations exceeding €1 million to flood victims in Mallorca earlier that year, underscoring his commitment to crisis response.\n\nBeyond the foundation, Nadal has engaged in direct charitable actions, including regular hospital visits to children with illnesses, where he shares motivational stories from his career to boost morale. He serves as an ambassador for the Laureus Sport for Good Foundation, advocating globally for youth empowerment through athletics. In recognition of these contributions, the Fundación Rafa Nadal received the 2024 Laureus Sport for Good Award, highlighting its role in transforming lives via sport. Nadal himself was honored with the ATP's Arthur Ashe Humanitarian Award in 2011 for his early philanthropic work, joining luminaries like Roger Federer in celebrating off-court impact.\n\nFollowing his retirement from professional tennis in November 2024 at the Davis Cup Finals, Nadal has intensified his focus on philanthropy, particularly expanding academy-linked scholarships for underprivileged youth. In 2025, he co-hosted the Children Ball gala in Hong Kong with the WEMP Foundation, raising historic funds—over HK$10 million—for global youth well-being programs, marking a shift toward broader international collaborations. This post-retirement emphasis builds on the foundation's 15-year legacy, prioritizing mental health, resilience, and inclusive play for thousands of children worldwide.\n\n### Sponsorships and endorsements\n\nRafael Nadal's sponsorships and endorsements have formed a cornerstone of his financial success, generating substantial income alongside his on-court earnings. Throughout his career, he amassed approximately $135 million in prize money, supplemented by over $200 million from endorsement deals, with annual endorsement income reaching $23 million as of 2025. These partnerships not only provided financial stability but also elevated his global brand, consistently placing him on Forbes' lists of highest-paid athletes.\n\nNadal's most prominent long-term deal was with Nike, starting at age 13 and spanning over two decades, valued at around $10 million annually and including custom apparel lines like the NikeCourt collection tailored to his playing style. In 2024, however, he declined a $150 million contract renewal from Nike due to his chronic foot condition, Müller-Weiss disease, and shifted to Hoka for more comfortable footwear while retaining apparel ties with other brands. He has maintained a partnership with Babolat for rackets since 1995, using customized Pure Aero models strung with RPM Blast, which became synonymous with his aggressive baseline game. Other key endorsements include Kia Motors since 2004, luxury watchmaker Richard Mille since 2008—resulting in 11 co-developed models tested under extreme conditions—and financial institutions like Santander Bank and telecommunications giant Telefónica.\n\nBeyond apparel and equipment, Nadal diversified through investments tied to his endorsements, including collaborations with Richard Mille on high-end timepieces capable of withstanding 12,000 g-forces and real estate ventures via his stake in Mabel Capital, which focuses on hospitality and property development in Spain. Post-retirement in late 2024, he continues as an ambassador for enduring partners like Kia, Babolat, and Richard Mille into 2025, participating in promotional events such as clinics in Seoul. His endorsement portfolio has significantly amplified Spanish sports marketing, embodying \"Brand Spain\" through campaigns that highlight national pride and tourism, thereby increasing visibility for local industries.\n\n### Rafa Nadal Sports Centre\n\nThe Rafa Nadal Academy, established in 2016 in Manacor, Mallorca, functions as a comprehensive tennis training facility designed to nurture young talent through high-performance programs. Spanning extensive grounds, it includes 45 tennis courts—23 hard courts (with four indoors) and 22 clay courts—alongside educational infrastructure such as the Rafa Nadal International School and residential accommodations for over 100 students, fostering an immersive environment for full-time development.\n\nThe academy's programs emphasize elite-level training for juniors and adults, incorporating daily sessions led by experienced coaches, many of whom are former professional players, to build technical, physical, and mental skills. It offers scholarships to promising players from underprivileged backgrounds, integrating tennis excellence with academic education to support long-term success, in line with a holistic philosophy that prioritizes personal growth alongside athletic achievement. Toni Nadal, Rafael Nadal's uncle and longtime coach, served as director until 2022, overseeing the curriculum's evolution to mirror the rigorous methods that shaped his nephew's career.\n\nSince its inception, the academy has expanded internationally to broaden its reach, opening the Rafa Nadal Tennis Center in Costa Mujeres, Mexico, in 2018 through a partnership with the Palladium Hotel Group, followed by a second center at the Sani Resort in Greece in 2019. Additional initiatives include tennis clinics and camps in locations such as Costa Rica, extending the academy's methodology to diverse regions. These efforts have cultivated a global network, with hundreds of alumni advancing in competitive tennis, including professionals like Casper Ruud and Jaume Munar, who trained there as juniors and credit the program for their professional breakthroughs.\n\nFollowing Rafael Nadal's retirement from professional tennis in 2024, the academy has hosted prominent junior tournaments in 2025, such as the ITF World Tennis Tour Juniors at its Manacor site, reinforcing its role as a hub for emerging talent. This charitable dimension aligns briefly with Nadal's broader philanthropy efforts, though the academy maintains its focus on structured training and education.\n\n### Involvement in football and other sports\n\nRafael Nadal has long been a devoted supporter of Real Madrid, frequently attending matches and expressing his allegiance despite familial ties to rival clubs. In November 2024, he was spotted in the stands at Anfield cheering for Real Madrid during their Champions League clash with Liverpool. This passion stems partly from his youth in Mallorca, where he initially pursued football alongside tennis, honing his skills on local pitches before committing fully to the racket sport. Nadal's enthusiasm for the game remains evident in his post-retirement activities, including potential future involvement with the club; in October 2024, reports emerged of his dream role within Real Madrid's hierarchy, with Nadal himself refusing to rule out a leadership position such as president by September 2025.\n\nNadal's family legacy in football adds depth to his connection, as his uncle, Miguel Ángel Nadal, enjoyed a distinguished career as a defender and midfielder, earning 62 caps for Spain and playing for RCD Mallorca (1986–1991) and FC Barcelona (1991–1999), where he won multiple La Liga titles and the 1992 European Cup. Inspired by his uncle, young Rafael often accompanied him to training sessions and aspired to a similar path, though his uncle Toni steered him toward tennis. Nadal has honored this heritage through exhibitions blending sports, such as a 2016 Milan event where he teamed with Novak Djokovic for a lighthearted \"football tennis\" match, showcasing his footwork in a hybrid format.\n\nBeyond football, Nadal engages in various sports for recreation and fitness. He is an avid golfer, displaying a distinctive swing reminiscent of his topspin forehand, and has been spotted on courses like TPC Sawgrass post-retirement in 2024, with speculation about competitive pursuits in celebrity events. Nadal also enjoys padel, a sport surging in popularity in Spain, and was filmed playing at his academy in March 2025, highlighting its appeal as a social alternative to tennis. For conditioning, he incorporates cycling, partnering with bike manufacturer Mondraker to ride custom models that support his active lifestyle.\n\nThrough the Rafa Nadal Foundation, established in 2010, Nadal promotes multi-sport participation among vulnerable youth, integrating activities like basketball, volleyball, and other implement sports into programs across Spain and India to foster physical, emotional, and social development. This initiative earned the 2024 Laureus Sport for Good Award for empowering over 1,000 children annually. In 2024, Nadal supported team sports at the Paris Olympics as a torchbearer, later joining Spain's National Olympic Committee in May 2025 as an athletes' representative to advocate for holistic athletic involvement.\n\n## Personal life\n\n### Family and beliefs\n\nRafael Nadal was born to Sebastián Nadal Homar, a businessman who co-owns a successful glass and windows company in Spain, and Ana María Parera Femenias, a former insurance broker who became a full-time housewife to raise her children. He has one younger sister, María Isabel \"Maribel\" Nadal, who works in the family business and launched her own sustainable clothing brand, Crabs Company, in 2023.\n\nNadal married his longtime partner, Maria Francisca \"Mery\" or \"Xisca\" Perelló, a childhood sweetheart from his hometown of Manacor, Mallorca, in October 2019 during a private ceremony at La Fortalesa castle on the island. The couple welcomed their first child, a son named Rafael Nadal Perelló, in October 2022, followed by their second son, Miquel Nadal Perelló, on August 7, 2025, named in honor of Perelló's late father.\n\nNadal's extended family remains closely tied to his life and career, rooted in Mallorca. His uncle Toni Nadal served as his primary coach from age three until 2017 and continues to influence his perspective on discipline and resilience. Another uncle, Miguel Ángel Nadal, is a former professional footballer who played for Barcelona and Spain, while other relatives, including cousins and his maternal grandparents, live nearby in Manacor and often join family gatherings.\n\nRaised in a devout Catholic household in Spain, Nadal has identified as Catholic throughout his life, though he has occasionally described himself as agnostic in interviews, emphasizing personal spirituality over strict dogma. Family values form the core of his worldview, with Nadal crediting his upbringing for instilling humility, respect, and a strong sense of loyalty; he frequently highlights how his parents' emphasis on grounded principles shaped his character amid professional success.\n\nNadal's personal philosophy centers on relentless work ethic, viewing perseverance as essential to achievement, a mindset reinforced by his family's support during his career. He often expresses profound gratitude for his opportunities in tennis and life, attributing his mindset to lessons from his Mallorcan roots. Nadal has been a vocal advocate against doping in sports, consistently affirming his belief in the cleanliness of the game and the integrity of anti-doping protocols, while defending clean athletes and calling for fair enforcement.\n\nFollowing his retirement from professional tennis in November 2024, Nadal has prioritized family time, enjoying outings in Mallorca with his wife, children, parents, sister, and extended relatives, describing this phase as fulfilling and motivating.\n\n### Residences\n\nRafael Nadal's primary residence is a modern villa in Porto Cristo, a coastal town in the municipality of Manacor on the island of Mallorca, Spain. Acquired about a decade ago and completed in recent years after extensive construction, the property spans 1.7 acres overlooking the harbor, featuring an infinity pool, expansive terraces, large windows for natural light, and space for his catamaran. This family estate, designed by architect Tomeu Esteva, serves as his main base, particularly following his 2024 retirement from professional tennis.\n\nIn addition to his Mallorca home, Nadal owns a luxury apartment in Madrid's upscale Colón y Serrano district, purchased in 2024 for approximately €4 million. The 280-square-meter property includes four bedrooms, five bathrooms, and modern amenities, providing a convenient base for training and urban activities near key facilities. He also maintains a vacation villa in Playa Nueva Romana, Dominican Republic, bought in 2012 for $2 million; this two-story, 227-square-meter beachfront home features three bedrooms, a private pool, tropical gardens, and access to a country club with tennis courts and a marina. For tournament periods, such as the BNP Paribas Open, Nadal has used a $42 million estate in Indian Wells, California, owned by tournament founder Larry Ellison, as a temporary base with practice courts.\n\nNadal's luxury assets include the superyacht *Great White*, a custom 80 Sunreef Power catamaran delivered in 2020, measuring 78.5 feet with over 3,800 square feet of living space, an open flybridge, bar, barbecue area, and jet ski garage; it is typically docked in Porto Cristo. He has also invested in Spanish real estate, notably a €200 million partnership with Abel Matutes for luxury residential developments on the Costa del Sol, including around 100 high-end homes in Marbella and Estepona approved in 2025, emphasizing gated security and sophisticated design.\n\nSince retiring in 2024, Nadal has made no major relocations, continuing to integrate his lifestyle with the Rafa Nadal Academy in nearby Manacor, where family members including his uncle Toni reside. Despite his global fame, he maintains a low-key approach to his properties, prioritizing seclusion and enhanced security measures implemented post-retirement to protect his privacy. All of Nadal's residences are strategically located near tennis facilities, reflecting his ongoing connection to the sport even after retirement.\n\n### Other endeavors\n\nBeyond his tennis career, Rafael Nadal has pursued various business ventures, including co-ownership of the Tatel restaurant chain, which features Mediterranean cuisine and locations in cities such as Madrid, Ibiza, Doha, and Valencia. In partnership with Meliá Hotels International, he launched the ZEL lifestyle hotel brand in 2022, with properties in Palma de Mallorca and a planned expansion to the Caribbean by 2025, emphasizing wellness and sports-themed experiences. These endeavors reflect Nadal's interest in hospitality and luxury lifestyle sectors.\n\nNadal has also engaged in media projects, including authoring memoirs such as *Rafa* (2011), co-written with journalist John Carlin, which details his early life and rise in tennis. In 2025, he narrated the official teaser trailer for Roland Garros, highlighting his ongoing connection to the tournament where he won 14 titles.\n\nHis investments span real estate and other assets, notably a 2025 joint venture with businessman Abel Matutes through Palya Invest to develop over 100 luxury homes in Marbella and Estepona on Spain's Costa del Sol, with a total commitment of €200 million. In February 2025, Nadal sold 44.9% of his stake in the Rafa Nadal Academy to GPF Capital for approximately €95 million, retaining significant involvement while bolstering his portfolio. These moves contribute to his estimated net worth exceeding $220 million as of mid-2025, derived from prize money, endorsements, and diversified holdings.\n\nPost-retirement, Nadal continues to lead aspects of the Rafa Nadal Academy in Manacor, Mallorca, focusing on its expansion and educational programs, including potential international outposts. He has expressed openness to coaching in the future but stated in June 2025 that current commitments, including family time, prevent a full-time role.\n\nNadal's personal hobbies include reading, as noted in his memoirs where he discusses drawing inspiration from literature during recovery periods. He maintains an apolitical stance, having distanced himself from tennis governance politics since 2013 and avoiding public partisan affiliations. In 2025, he participated in exhibition events, sending a supportive message to Team Europe at the Laver Cup in San Francisco and fueling speculation about a potential joint tour with Roger Federer.\n\n### Health\n\nRafael Nadal has battled chronic and acute injuries throughout his professional tennis career, significantly impacting his playing time and requiring extensive medical interventions. His most persistent issue has been Müller-Weiss syndrome, a rare degenerative condition affecting the navicular bone in his left foot, which he has managed since at least 2005 and which led to surgery in September 2021 to alleviate chronic pain, though the condition remains incurable. Knee problems, including tendinitis in both knees starting in 2009 and a patellar tendon tear in 2012, forced him to miss major tournaments and nearly an entire season, with treatments focusing on conservative management to avoid surgery. Other notable injuries include appendicitis requiring surgery in 2014, a right wrist injury in 2014 that sidelined him for three months, a left wrist issue in 2016 causing further withdrawals, shoulder discomfort recurring from 2006 onward, and a hip flexor (iliopsoas) injury in 2023–2024 that necessitated arthroscopic surgery in June 2023 and contributed to his retirement.\n\nNadal underwent more than a dozen surgical procedures across his career, including operations on his appendix, foot, ankle (in 2018 to remove a loose body), and hip, alongside non-surgical treatments such as platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections for his knees around 2013–2014 and stem cell therapy for back issues in 2014. These interventions, combined with ongoing physiotherapy, helped him return to competition multiple times, but the cumulative toll resulted in over 200 weeks missed due to injury, including nearly full seasons in 2012 and 2023, and partial absences in 2009, 2014, 2021, and 2024. The physical strain exacted a mental toll as well, with Nadal describing himself as \"destroyed mentally\" after injury-related setbacks and admitting to daily pain that tested his resilience.\n\nFollowing his retirement in November 2024, Nadal shifted focus to rehabilitation in 2025, reporting difficulties walking for a full month post-retirement due to lingering effects but emphasizing recovery without plans for a competitive return. To prevent further issues, he relied on a dedicated team of physiotherapists at the Rafa Nadal Academy for customized recovery programs and incorporated yoga into his routine for flexibility, mental focus, and injury mitigation.\n\n## Career statistics\n\n### Grand Slam tournament performance timeline\n\nThe Grand Slam tournament performance timeline below summarizes Rafael Nadal's results in the four major championships from his debut in 2003 through 2024, when he retired from professional tennis.

He is the only man to win multiple majors on each surface.\n\n### Singles: 30 (22 titles, 8 runner-ups)\n\nRafael Nadal reached 30 Grand Slam singles finals throughout his career, compiling an overall record of 22 titles and 8 runner-up finishes. His tournament-specific records include a perfect 14–0 at the French Open on clay, 4–1 at the US Open on hard courts, 2–4 at the Australian Open on hard courts, and 2–3 at Wimbledon on grass.\n\nThe following table lists all of Nadal's Grand Slam singles finals in chronological order, including the year, tournament, surface, opponent, result (win for Nadal unless noted as loss), and final score.\n\n| Year | Tournament       | Surface | Opponent          | Result | Score                          |\n|------|------------------|---------|-------------------|--------|--------------------------------|\n| 2005 | French Open     | Clay    | Mariano Puerta   | Win    | 6–7(6–8), 6–3, 6–1, 7–5       |\n| 2006 | French Open     | Clay    | Roger Federer    | Win    | 1–6, 6–1, 6–4, 7–6(7–4)       |\n| 2006 | Wimbledon       | Grass   | Roger Federer    | Loss   | 6–0, 7–6(7–5), 6–7(2–7), 6–3  |\n| 2007 | French Open     | Clay    | Roger Federer    | Win    | 6–3, 4–6, 6–3, 6–4            |\n| 2007 | Wimbledon       | Grass   | Roger Federer    | Loss   | 7–6(9–7), 4–6, 7–6(7–3), 2–6, 6–2 |\n| 2008 | French Open     | Clay    | Roger Federer    | Win    | 6–1, 6–3, 6–0                 |\n| 2008 | Wimbledon       | Grass   | Roger Federer    | Win    | 6–4, 6–4, 6–7(5–7), 6–7(8–10), 9–7 |\n| 2009 | Australian Open | Hard    | Roger Federer    | Win    | 7–5, 3–6, 7–6(7–3), 3–6, 6–2  |\n| 2010 | French Open     | Clay    | Robin Söderling  | Win    | 6–4, 6–2, 6–4                 |\n| 2010 | Wimbledon       | Grass   | Tomáš Berdych    | Win    | 6–3, 7–5, 6–4                 |\n| 2010 | US Open         | Hard    | Novak Djokovic   | Win    | 6–4, 5–7, 6–4, 6–2            |\n| 2011 | French Open     | Clay    | Roger Federer    | Win    | 7–5, 7–6(7–3), 5–7, 6–1       |\n| 2011 | Wimbledon       | Grass   | Novak Djokovic   | Loss   | 6–4, 6–1, 1–6, 6–3            |\n| 2011 | US Open         | Hard    | Novak Djokovic   | Loss   | 6–2, 6–4, 6–7(3–7), 6–1       |\n| 2012 | Australian Open | Hard    | Novak Djokovic   | Loss   | 5–7, 6–4, 6–2, 6–7(5–7), 7–5  |\n| 2012 | French Open     | Clay    | Novak Djokovic   | Win    | 6–4, 6–3, 2–6, 7–5            |\n| 2013 | French Open     | Clay    | David Ferrer     | Win    | 6–3, 6–2, 6–3                 |\n| 2013 | US Open         | Hard    | Novak Djokovic   | Win    | 6–2, 3–6, 6–4, 6–1            |\n| 2014 | Australian Open | Hard    | Stan Wawrinka    | Loss   | 6–3, 6–2, 3–6, 6–3            |\n| 2014 | French Open     | Clay    | Novak Djokovic   | Win    | 3–6, 7–5, 6–2, 6–4            |\n| 2017 | Australian Open | Hard    | Roger Federer    | Loss   | 6–4, 3–6, 6–1, 3–6, 6–3       |\n| 2017 | French Open     | Clay    | Stan Wawrinka    | Win    | 6–2, 6–3, 6–1                 |\n| 2017 | US Open         | Hard    | Kevin Anderson   | Win    | 6–3, 6–3, 6–4                 |\n| 2018 | French Open     | Clay    | Dominic Thiem    | Win    | 6–4, 6–3, 6–2                 |\n| 2019 | Australian Open | Hard    | Novak Djokovic   | Loss   | 6–3, 6–2, 6–3                 |\n| 2019 | French Open     | Clay    | Dominic Thiem    | Win    | 6–3, 5–7, 6–1, 6–1            |\n| 2019 | US Open         | Hard    | Daniil Medvedev  | Win    | 7–5, 6–3, 5–7, 4–6, 6–4       |\n| 2020 | French Open     | Clay    | Novak Djokovic   | Win    | 6–0, 6–2, 7–5                 |\n| 2022 | Australian Open | Hard    | Daniil Medvedev  | Win    | 2–6, 6–7(5–7), 6–4, 6–4, 7–5  |\n| 2022 | French Open     | Clay    | Casper Ruud      | Win    | 6–3, 6–3, 6–0                 |\n\n### Year–End Championships performance timeline\n\nRafael Nadal qualified for the ATP Finals a record 17 times between 2005 and 2022, participating in 14 editions where he competed, compiling an overall match record of 21 wins and 18 losses across 39 matches. His appearances were often hampered by injuries, leading to absences in several qualified years, including 2008, 2012, 2014, 2016, and 2018. In the group stage, Nadal achieved a 20–13 record, advancing to the knockout rounds in nine tournaments.\n\nDespite his dominance elsewhere on the ATP Tour, Nadal never won the ATP Finals title, finishing as runner-up twice—losing the 2010 final to Roger Federer 6–3, 6–3, 6–1 and the 2013 final to Novak Djokovic 6–3, 6–4. He reached the semifinals on four occasions (2006, 2007, 2015, and 2020), each time falling short of the final. Notable performances include perfect 3–0 group-stage records in 2010, 2013, and 2015, showcasing his ability to peak late in the season when healthy.\n\nInjuries limited his post-2020 involvement; after reaching the semifinals in 2020, Nadal exited in the group stage in 2022 and did not qualify thereafter amid ongoing physical challenges that contributed to his retirement in 2024.\n\n| Year | Result                  |\n|------|-------------------------|\n| 2005 | Semifinals (L Federer) |\n| 2006 | Semifinals (L Federer) |\n| 2007 | Semifinals (L Federer) |\n| 2008 | Qualified, did not participate |\n| 2009 | Round robin             |\n| 2010 | Final (L Federer)      |\n| 2011 | Round robin             |\n| 2012 | Qualified, did not participate |\n| 2013 | Final (L Djokovic)     |\n| 2014 | Qualified, did not participate |\n| 2015 | Semifinals (L Djokovic)|\n| 2016 | Qualified, did not participate |\n| 2017 | Round robin (withdrew)  |\n| 2018 | Qualified, did not participate |\n| 2019 | Round robin             |\n| 2020 | Semifinals (L Medvedev)|\n| 2021 | Did not qualify         |\n| 2022 | Round robin             |\n| 2023 | Did not qualify         |\n\nThe table details Nadal's progression in each edition he entered, with round robin indicating failure to advance from the group stage; all results played on indoor hard courts.\n\n### Olympic gold medal matches\n\nRafael Nadal achieved two Olympic gold medals in tennis, securing the singles title in 2008 and the doubles title in 2016, which contributed to his completion of the career Golden Slam—the feat of winning all four Grand Slam tournaments and an Olympic gold in singles.\n\nIn the 2008 Beijing Olympics men's singles final, Nadal faced Chile's Fernando González on the hard courts of the Olympic Green Tennis Centre. Nadal won 6–3, 7–6(2), 6–3 in a three-set match, marking his first Olympic appearance and Spain's first men's singles gold in tennis.\n\nNadal's second gold came at the 2016 Rio Olympics in men's doubles, partnering with fellow Spaniard Marc López. In the final against Romania's Florin Mergea and Horia Tecau, the pair overcame a competitive second set to triumph 6–2, 3–6, 6–4, securing Spain's inaugural Olympic men's doubles title and Nadal's second career Olympic gold.\n\nNadal's Olympic journey also featured a singles bronze medal opportunity at the 2012 London Games, though he ultimately did not compete due to illness; in 2024 Paris, he paired with Carlos Alcaraz in doubles, advancing to the quarterfinals before a 6–2, 6–4 defeat to Americans Austin Krajicek and Rajeev Ram. Over his Olympic career, Nadal amassed two golds with a 19–6 match record across events.\n\n## Records and awards\n\n### All-time tournament records\n\nRafael Nadal holds the all-time record for the most French Open titles with 14 victories, achieved between 2005 and 2022, establishing him as the dominant figure in the tournament's history. His undefeated 14-0 record in French Open finals underscores this unparalleled success on clay.\n\nNadal amassed a record 26 ATP Masters 1000 titles on clay courts, comprising 11 wins at the Monte Carlo Masters (2005–2012, 2016–2018), 10 at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia in Rome (2005–2007, 2009–2013, 2018–2019, 2021), and 5 at the Mutua Madrid Open, including 4 on clay (2005, 2013, 2014, 2017). These triumphs highlight his supremacy in the premier clay-court events, where he completed career Super 1000s on the surface multiple times. Nadal holds the Open Era record of 36 Masters 1000 titles and 63 clay-court titles overall. He also achieved an 81-match winning streak on clay from 2005 to 2008.\n\nIn team competition, Nadal contributed to Spain's Davis Cup success with a record 29 consecutive singles victories from 2004 to 2011, part of a broader 32-match unbeaten streak across singles and doubles that spanned from 2006 to 2019. This run helped secure five Davis Cup titles for Spain in 2004, 2008, 2009, 2011, and 2019.\n\nNadal won 23 ATP 500-level titles and 10 ATP 250-level titles, with a significant portion on clay, including multiple victories at events like Barcelona (12 titles, though elevated to 500 status later) and other clay staples such as Rio de Janeiro and Stuttgart. These successes contributed to his overall 63 clay-court titles, the most in history.\n\nAgainst top-10 opponents, Nadal compiled a 186–105 record throughout his career, demonstrating consistent excellence in high-stakes matches.\n\nAt age 35, Nadal became one of the oldest players to win the Australian Open in 2022, defeating Daniil Medvedev in the final to claim his second title there and a record-breaking 21st Grand Slam.\n\n| Record | Achievement | Details |\n|--------|-------------|---------|\n| French Open Titles | 14 | 2005–2008, 2010–2014, 2017–2020, 2022 |\n| Clay Masters 1000 Titles | 26 | 11 Monte Carlo, 10 Rome, 4 Madrid (clay), 1 Hamburg (2008) |\n| Davis Cup Consecutive Wins | 32 (singles \\u0026 doubles) | 2006–2019 |\n| ATP 500 Titles | 23 | Many on clay, e.g., 12 Barcelona |\n| ATP 250 Titles | 10 | Including clay events like Bastad, Palermo |\n| H2H vs. Top 10 | 186–105 | Career record |\n| Oldest AO Winner (post-1972) | 35 years | 2022 title |\n\n### Open Era records\n\nRafael Nadal holds numerous records in the Open Era of professional tennis, which began in 1968, particularly in clay-court dominance and sustained excellence across majors and rankings. His achievements underscore a career marked by unparalleled consistency on his preferred surface and remarkable longevity in high-stakes competitions.\n\nNadal's 14 French Open titles represent the most clay-court Grand Slam victories by any player in the Open Era, achieved between 2005 and 2022, surpassing all previous benchmarks for dominance at a single major. This feat includes five consecutive wins from 2010 to 2014, the longest streak at Roland Garros in the Open Era. Complementing this, he amassed 112 match wins at the French Open, the highest total at any single tournament in men's Open Era history, with an overall record of 112-4.\n\nBeyond majors, Nadal set the Open Era mark for consecutive titles at one event with eight straight victories at the Monte Carlo Masters from 2005 to 2012, a streak that highlighted his early clay-court supremacy. As part of the \"Big Three\" alongside Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic—who together held the year-end No. 1 ranking in 17 seasons from 2004 to 2021 (all except 2016)—Nadal contributed 209 weeks at No. 1, third-most all-time and a key factor in the trio's shared record of 54 consecutive weeks controlling the top three rankings positions.\n\nNadal won eight ATP titles before turning 20 in 2006, the most by any teenager in the Open Era, including his first Grand Slam at the 2005 French Open and multiple Masters 1000 crowns that established him as a prodigy. Demonstrating exceptional durability, he secured six Grand Slam titles after age 30—2017 French Open and US Open, 2019 French Open and US Open, 2020 French Open, and 2022 French Open—tying for the second-most in the Open Era behind only Djokovic. These post-30 triumphs, amid chronic injury challenges, overlap with all-time longevity records while emphasizing his Open Era impact.\n\n### Professional awards\n\nRafael Nadal has received numerous prestigious professional awards throughout his tennis career, recognizing his exceptional performance, sportsmanship, and contributions to the sport. These honors, bestowed by governing bodies like the International Tennis Federation (ITF) and the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), as well as international sports organizations, highlight his dominance and character on and off the court.\n\nNadal was named ITF World Champion in 2008, 2010, 2017, 2019, and 2022, bringing his total to five ITF World Champion honors by the end of his career. The ITF selects recipients based on overall performance and impact in international tennis. In 2010, he captured three Grand Slam titles at the French Open, Wimbledon, and US Open.\n\nIn recognition of his year-end world No. 1 rankings, Nadal received the ATP Player of the Year award five times: 2008, 2010, 2013, 2017, and 2019. This accolade, voted by ATP players, media, and officials, celebrates the top performer of the season, with Nadal's wins underscoring his consistency across surfaces and tournaments.\n\nNadal was honored as Laureus World Sportsman of the Year in 2011, after a dominant run that included his first US Open title and a career Grand Slam, and again in 2021, following his record-extending 13th French Open victory amid a challenging comeback year. The Laureus Awards, often called the \"Oscars of Sport,\" are determined by a global academy of past winners and highlight athletes' achievements and inspiration.\n\nHe won the ESPY Award for Best Male Tennis Player on several occasions, including in 2011, 2014, and 2022, as voted by fans, athletes, and broadcasters through ESPN's annual ceremony. These awards affirmed his status as one of the sport's elite performers during peak seasons.\n\nFor his exemplary conduct and integrity, Nadal received the Stefan Edberg Sportsmanship Award multiple times, including in 2010 and from 2018 to 2021, as selected by fellow ATP players. This reflects his reputation for fairness and respect in competitive situations.\n\nFollowing his retirement in November 2024, Nadal was granted the hereditary title of Marquess of Llevant de Mallorca by King Felipe VI of Spain in June 2025, honoring his contributions to sports and his Mallorcan heritage. Additionally, in May 2025, during a tribute ceremony at the French Open, a commemorative plaque bearing his name and footprint was unveiled on Court Philippe-Chatrier, immortalizing his record 14 titles at the tournament.",
