It specializes in the discovery, development, manufacturing, and commercialization of prescription medicines, primarily for the treatment of diseases in oncology, cardiovascular, renal & metabolism, and respiratory & immunology. Formed in 1999 through the merger of Astra AB of Sweden and Zeneca Group PLC of the UK, AstraZeneca has grown to become one of the world's leading pharmaceutical companies, with a presence in over 100 countries and a workforce of approximately 83,500 employees as of 2023 [AstraZeneca Annual Report 2022](https://www.astrazeneca.com/investor-relations/annual-reports.html).\n\nThe company is publicly traded on the London Stock Exchange (LSE: AZN), NASDAQ (AZN), and Nasdaq Stockholm, and it is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. AstraZeneca gained significant global attention during the COVID-19 pandemic for its development of a COVID-19 vaccine in collaboration with the University of Oxford, known as Vaxzevria or the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine [WHO on AstraZeneca Vaccine](https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/the-oxford-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-what-you-need-to-know).\n\n## Historical Background\n\n### Formation and Early Years\nAstraZeneca was established on April 6, 1999, through the merger of Astra AB, a Swedish pharmaceutical company founded in 1913, and Zeneca Group PLC, a British company that had demerged from Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) in 1993. The merger created one of the largest pharmaceutical companies at the time, with a combined market capitalization of approximately $67 billion. The goal of the merger was to combine complementary strengths in research and development (R&D) and to achieve economies of scale in a highly competitive industry [BBC News on Merger](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/229053.stm).\n\nAstra AB had a history of innovation in gastrointestinal treatments, notably with the development of Losec (omeprazole), a proton pump inhibitor that became one of the best-selling drugs in the world. Zeneca, on the other hand, brought expertise in oncology and agrochemicals, with key products like tamoxifen, a breast cancer treatment. The merger allowed AstraZeneca to diversify its portfolio and expand its global footprint.\n\n### Growth and Challenges\nIn the early 2000s, AstraZeneca focused on strengthening its R&D pipeline, investing heavily in biologics and personalized medicine. The company faced challenges such as patent expirations on blockbuster drugs like Nexium (esomeprazole) and Crestor (rosuvastatin), which led to increased competition from generic manufacturers. To counter this, AstraZeneca pursued strategic acquisitions, including the purchase of MedImmune in 2007 for $15.6 billion, which bolstered its biologics capabilities [Reuters on MedImmune Acquisition](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-astrazeneca-medimmune-idUSN1931497920070419).\n\nUnder the leadership of CEO Pascal Soriot, who joined in 2012, AstraZeneca underwent a significant turnaround, refocusing on core therapeutic areas and achieving growth through innovative drugs like Tagrisso (osimertinib) for lung cancer and Lynparza (olaparib) for ovarian and breast cancer. The company also fended off a hostile takeover bid from Pfizer in 2014, valued at $119 billion, emphasizing its commitment to independence and long-term strategy [The Guardian on Pfizer Bid](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/may/19/astrazeneca-rejects-pfizer-takeover-bid).\n\n## Current Status and Relevance\n\nAs of 2023, AstraZeneca remains a key player in the global pharmaceutical industry, with reported revenues of $44.4 billion in 2022. Its R&D expenditure, which amounted to $9.5 billion in 2022, reflects its commitment to innovation, with a pipeline of over 170 projects [AstraZeneca Financial Results](https://www.astrazeneca.com/investor-relations/financial-results.html). The company operates in three main therapeutic areas:\n- **Oncology**: AstraZeneca is a leader in cancer treatment, with drugs like Tagrisso and Imfinzi (durvalumab) driving significant revenue.\n- **Cardiovascular, Renal & Metabolism**: Key products include Farxiga (dapagliflozin), used for diabetes and heart failure.\n- **Respiratory & Immunology**: Treatments like Symbicort (budesonide/formoterol) for asthma and COPD are widely used.\n\nAstraZeneca's role in global health was highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, developed in partnership with the University of Oxford, was one of the first vaccines to receive emergency use authorization in multiple countries. Over 3 billion doses have been distributed worldwide, often at cost or through initiatives like COVAX to support low-income countries [Gavi on COVAX](https://www.gavi.org/covax-facility). However, the vaccine faced scrutiny over rare side effects, such as blood clotting, leading to temporary suspensions in some regions before being deemed safe by regulators like the European Medicines Agency (EMA) [EMA on AstraZeneca Vaccine](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/astrazenecas-covid-19-vaccine-ema-finds-possible-link-very-rare-cases-unusual-blood-clots-low-blood).\n\n## Notable Facts and Details\n\n- **Headquarters and Operations**: AstraZeneca’s global headquarters are in Cambridge, UK, with major R&D centers in Sweden, the US, and China.
