She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, the first person to win two Nobel Prizes, and remains the only individual to have received Nobel Prizes in two different scientific fields—Physics (1903) and Chemistry (1911). Curie's work not only advanced scientific understanding of radioactive elements but also laid the foundation for modern nuclear physics and medical applications like cancer treatment. Her life and achievements continue to inspire scientists and women in STEM fields worldwide [Nobel Prize Biography](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1903/marie-curie/biographical/).\n\n## Historical Background\n\nMarie Curie was born into a family of educators in Warsaw, which was then under Russian control as part of the Russian Empire. Facing limited opportunities for higher education as a woman in Poland, she moved to Paris in 1891 to study at the Sorbonne, where she earned degrees in physics and mathematics. It was in Paris that she met Pierre Curie, a physicist, whom she married in 1895. Together, they embarked on research into radioactivity, a term Marie herself coined [Britannica: Marie Curie](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Marie-Curie).\n\nTheir collaborative work led to the discovery of two new elements, polonium (named after Marie’s homeland, Poland) and radium, in 1898. This research was conducted under challenging conditions in a rudimentary laboratory, highlighting their dedication to science. In 1903, Marie, Pierre, and Henri Becquerel shared the Nobel Prize in Physics for their studies on radioactivity. After Pierre’s tragic death in 1906, Marie continued her research, becoming the first woman to hold a professorship at the Sorbonne [History.com: Marie Curie](https://www.history.com/topics/womens-history/marie-curie).\n\nIn 1911, she received a second Nobel Prize, this time in Chemistry, for her discovery of radium and polonium and her investigation of their properties. During World War I, Curie contributed to the war effort by developing mobile radiography units, known as \"Little Curies,\" to provide X-ray services to field hospitals, saving countless lives [Smithsonian: Marie Curie](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/madame-curies-passion-74132344/).\n\nDespite her achievements, Curie faced significant gender-based discrimination and health challenges due to prolonged exposure to radiation, which was not well understood at the time. She died on July 4, 1934, in Sancellemoz, France, from aplastic anemia, likely caused by her work with radioactive materials [Nobel Prize Biography](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1903/marie-curie/biographical/).\n\n## Current Status and Relevance\n\nMarie Curie’s contributions remain profoundly relevant in modern science and medicine. Her discoveries of radium and polonium paved the way for advancements in nuclear physics and chemistry, influencing technologies such as nuclear energy and medical imaging. Radium, once used directly in cancer treatments, has been largely replaced by safer alternatives, but her work on radioactivity underpins contemporary radiotherapy techniques [American Cancer Society: History of Radiation Therapy](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/understanding-cancer/history-of-cancer/cancer-treatment-history.html).\n\nCurie’s legacy also extends to gender equality in science. As a trailblazer for women in STEM, her perseverance in the face of systemic barriers continues to inspire initiatives aimed at increasing female representation in scientific fields. Institutions like the Curie Institute in Paris, founded by Marie herself in 1920, remain at the forefront of cancer research and treatment [Curie Institute](https://www.curie.fr/en).\n\nAdditionally, her story raises awareness about the risks of radiation exposure. Modern safety protocols for handling radioactive materials owe much to lessons learned from Curie’s era, when the dangers were not fully understood. Her notebooks, still radioactive, are kept in lead-lined boxes and require protective gear to handle [Science Magazine: Curie’s Notebooks](https://www.science.org/content/article/marie-curies-century-old-radioactive-notebooks-still-require-lead-shielding).\n\n## Notable Facts and Details\n\n- **Dual Nobel Laureate**: Marie Curie is the only person to win Nobel Prizes in two different sciences—Physics (1903) and Chemistry (1911) [Nobel Prize Biography](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1903/marie-curie/biographical/).\n- **Element Discoveries**: She discovered polonium and radium, isolating radium as a pure metal in 1910, a feat that required processing tons of pitchblende ore [Britannica: Marie Curie](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Marie-Curie).\n- **War Efforts**: During World War I, Curie equipped ambulances with X-ray machines and trained technicians, personally operating these units near the front lines [Smithsonian: Marie Curie](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/madame-curies-passion-74132344/).\n- **Health Impact**: Her prolonged exposure to radiation likely caused her fatal illness, aplastic anemia, and she carried test tubes of radioactive material in her pockets, unaware of the risks [Science Magazine: Curie’s Notebooks](https://www.science.org/content/article/marie-curies-century-old-radioactive-notebooks-still-require-lead-shielding).\n- **Family Legacy**: Her daughter, Irène Joliot-Curie, also won a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1935 for discovering artificial radioactivity, continuing the family’s scientific tradition [Nobel Prize: Irène Joliot-Curie](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/1935/joliot-curie/biographical/).\n\n## Related Topics\n\n- **Radioactivity**: The phenomenon Marie Curie studied and named, central to her discoveries and modern nuclear science.\n- **Pierre Curie**: Her husband and collaborator, co-recipient of the 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics.\n- **Nobel Prize**: The prestigious award Curie won twice, highlighting her unparalleled contributions to science.\n- **Women in STEM**: Curie’s life exemplifies the challenges and triumphs of women in scientific fields, inspiring ongoing gender equity efforts.\n- **Radiation Therapy**: A medical field influenced by Curie’s work, widely used in cancer treatment today.\n\n## References\n\n- [Nobel Prize Biography](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1903/marie-curie/biographical/)\n- [Britannica: Marie Curie](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Marie-Curie)\n- [History.com: Marie Curie](https://www.history.com/topics/womens-history/marie-curie)\n- [Smithsonian: Marie Curie](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/madame-curies-passion-74132344/)\n- [American Cancer Society: History of Radiation Therapy](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/understanding-cancer/history-of-cancer/cancer-treatment-history.html)\n- [Curie Institute](https://www.curie.fr/en)\n- [Science Magazine: Curie’s Notebooks](https://www.science.org/content/article/marie-curies-century-old-radioactive-notebooks-still-require-lead-shielding)\n- [Nobel Prize: Irène Joliot-Curie](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/1935/joliot-curie/biographical/)",
