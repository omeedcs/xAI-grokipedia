  "content": "# Queen\n\nQueen are a British rock band formed in London in 1970, originally comprising lead vocalist Freddie Mercury, guitarist Brian May, drummer Roger Taylor, and bassist John Deacon. The group pioneered a distinctive blend of hard rock, progressive elements, and operatic vocals, characterized by elaborate staging and multimedia production that defied conventional rock norms. Their breakthrough came with the 1975 album *A Night at the Opera*, featuring the six-minute epic \"Bohemian Rhapsody,\" which topped the UK Singles Chart for nine weeks and achieved diamond certification in the United States with over 10 million units sold or streamed. Queen's commercial peak included massive global tours, such as the 1986 Magic Tour, and an iconic 20-minute set at the 1985 Live Aid concert, often cited as one of the greatest live performances in rock history due to its energy and audience engagement.\n\nThe band's catalog has generated enduring sales, with their 1981 compilation *Greatest Hits* becoming the first album to exceed seven million copies sold in the United Kingdom, a record reflecting sustained popularity. Overall, Queen have sold over 125 million albums worldwide, bolstered by hits like \"We Will Rock You\" and \"Another One Bites the Dust,\" which exemplify their anthemic songwriting and rhythmic innovation. Following Mercury's death from AIDS-related pneumonia in 1991, May, Taylor, and Deacon largely retired from touring, though May and Taylor revived live performances in 2005 with vocalist Adam Lambert, extending the band's reach to new audiences. Queen were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001 and received the Polar Music Prize in 2025 for their foundational influence on rock music's theatrical and genre-blending evolution. Their legacy endures as the most-played rock act on UK radio and television in the 21st century, underscoring empirical measures of cultural impact over decades.\n\n## Monarchy\n\n### Queen regnant\n\nA queen regnant is a female monarch who reigns *suo jure*, meaning in her own right as the sovereign ruler of a state, possessing full regal powers equivalent to those of a king, including succession, legislation, and executive authority, without deriving her position from marriage to a male ruler. This distinguishes her from a queen consort, whose role is ceremonial or supportive. The term emphasizes independent inheritance or acquisition of the throne, often through primogeniture laws that permit female succession, as implemented in various European monarchies since the Middle Ages.\n\nHistorical precedents illustrate the efficacy of queens regnant in maintaining and expanding territorial influence and internal stability. Cleopatra VII Philopator ruled the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt from 51 BCE to 30 BCE, navigating Roman expansionism through calculated alliances, including her relationship with Julius Caesar, which resulted in the birth of Caesarion and temporary reinforcement of Egyptian autonomy, and later with Mark Antony, yielding military campaigns that briefly extended Ptolemaic control over parts of the Levant and Cyprus. Her governance preserved Egypt's grain exports critical to Rome, averting immediate conquest until Actium in 31 BCE. Similarly, Elizabeth I of England acceded on 17 November 1558 and ruled until 24 March 1603, defeating the Spanish Armada on 8 August 1588 through superior naval tactics and intelligence, which secured Protestant England's independence and initiated colonial ventures, while her 45-year reign coincided with a population growth from 3 million to 4 million and the establishment of the East India Company in 1600, laying foundations for global trade dominance.\n\nIn contemporary constitutional monarchies, queens regnant have exemplified continuity amid democratic frameworks. Margrethe II of Denmark succeeded on 14 January 1972 following her father's death and abdicated on 14 January 2024 after 52 years, during which Denmark transitioned from an agrarian economy to a high-tech welfare state, with real GDP per capita rising from about $25,000 in 1972 to $68,000 in 2023, supported by export-led growth in pharmaceuticals and renewables. Her successor, Frederik X, her eldest son, ascended immediately, preserving dynastic succession under the Act of Succession amended in 1953 to allow absolute primogeniture, which ensures gender-neutral inheritance and has minimized succession disputes in Scandinavian monarchies. This model contrasts with republican systems prone to electoral volatility, as Denmark maintained its AAA credit rating and ranked consistently in the top 5 globally for governance stability indices throughout her tenure.\n\nEmpirical outcomes under long-reigning queens regnant highlight causal links between hereditary stability and policy consistency, fostering national identity and economic resilience. Under Elizabeth I, England's defeat of the Armada correlated with a 50% increase in shipbuilding capacity by 1600, enabling mercantile expansion that outpaced contemporaneous Spanish decline. In Denmark under Margrethe II, low political fragmentation—evidenced by only five prime ministerial changes despite coalition governments—facilitated sustained investments, yielding average annual GDP growth of 1.8% from 1972 to 2023, outperforming several European republics like Italy (1.2%) in comparable periods, attributable to monarchical symbolism reinforcing social cohesion amid welfare reforms. Such reigns demonstrate that female sovereigns, unencumbered by consort roles, have historically prioritized pragmatic statecraft over factionalism, with data from stability metrics showing constitutional monarchies averaging 20% fewer leadership turnovers than republics since 1900.\n\n### Queen consort\n\nA queen consort is the wife of a reigning king, entitled to the rank and status of her spouse but without sovereign authority or constitutional powers. Her position derives solely from marriage, emphasizing ceremonial, advisory, and familial support rather than independent governance. In practice, this involves providing companionship, moral reinforcement, and logistical assistance to the monarch, including participation in state events, diplomatic receptions, and household management to maintain royal stability. \n\nQueen consorts historically contribute to dynastic continuity by bearing and raising heirs, thereby legitimizing succession and fostering alliances through marriage, though their influence remains informal and subordinate to the king's prerogative. For instance, in the United Kingdom, Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, queen consort from the coronation of King George VI on 12 May 1937 until his death on 6 February 1952, exemplified this by supporting wartime resilience; she visited bombed areas, boosted public morale during the Blitz from September 1940 to May 1941, and prioritized family cohesion amid abdication crises and global conflict, helping preserve monarchical continuity without wielding executive power. Similarly, Camilla became queen consort on 8 September 2022 upon King Charles III's accession following Queen Elizabeth II's death, undertaking public duties such as charity patronages focused on literacy and domestic violence prevention, while advising on transitional family matters during the shift from the previous reign. \n\nEmpirical records show queen consorts often channel efforts into philanthropy and soft diplomacy, with data from royal archives indicating sustained public engagements—such as over 200 annual appearances by 20th-century consorts—to reinforce institutional legitimacy without altering policy. This advisory role, while influential in personal counsel, lacks legal enforceability, as evidenced by precedents where consorts deferred to the sovereign in crises, prioritizing familial and ceremonial duties to underpin monarchical endurance over centuries.\n\n### Variations and historical context\n\nA queen dowager refers to the widow of a king, who retains her queenly title and precedence but exercises no sovereign power. If such a dowager is also the mother of the reigning monarch, she holds the style of queen mother. Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon (1900–2002), widow of King George VI and mother of Queen Elizabeth II, exemplified this role as Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother; during World War II, she bolstered public morale through visits to bomb-damaged areas in London and direct engagement with civilians, earning praise for her resilience amid the Blitz.\n\nThe English term \"queen\" originates from Old English *cwēn*, which denoted a woman, wife, or noble female of elevated status, deriving from Proto-Germanic *kwēniz and ultimately Proto-Indo-European roots linked to feminine concepts. Over centuries, its application in monarchical systems evolved to emphasize supremacy as a ruler or consort, reflecting broader shifts from tribal chieftainships—where queens often wielded advisory or regency influence—to formalized feudal hierarchies, and later to constitutional frameworks where queens serve ceremonial functions subordinate to parliamentary authority.\n\nIn contemporary contexts, abdications highlight health-driven transitions rather than ideological concessions; Denmark's Queen Margrethe II, for instance, stepped down on January 14, 2024—52 years after her accession—following back surgery, passing the throne to her son Frederik X without altering the hereditary principle. While critics note the dilution of monarchical authority to symbolic duties amid egalitarian pressures, empirical data from polls counters erosion narratives: in the United Kingdom, 65% supported retaining the monarchy over an elected head of state as of August 2025, indicating enduring public preference for traditional continuity. This support underscores monarchy's causal function in maintaining cultural stability, as evidenced by consistent majorities favoring inherited institutions despite symbolic constraints.\n\n## Biology and natural sciences\n\n### In insects\n\nIn eusocial insects such as bees, ants, and termites, the queen caste represents the primary reproductive female, exhibiting reproductive monopoly within the colony to maximize inclusive fitness through kin selection. This division of labor enhances colony efficiency, with the queen focusing on egg production while sterile workers handle foraging, defense, and brood care. Empirical studies confirm that queen presence correlates with suppressed worker ovarian development, ensuring reproductive stability.\n\nIn the honey bee *Apis mellifera*, the queen serves as the sole fertile female, capable of laying up to 2,000 eggs per day during peak seasons, equivalent to her body weight in offspring. She maintains worker sterility primarily through queen mandibular pheromone (QMP), a blend of fatty acids that inhibits ovarian activation and promotes altruistic behaviors in workers. Removal of the queen leads to rapid worker reproductive activation, underscoring the pheromone's causal role in caste regulation.\n\nAnt queens similarly monopolize reproduction, founding new colonies independently or cooperatively after nuptial flights where virgin queens mate with males mid-air, storing sperm for lifelong use. Post-mating, the queen sheds her wings, excavates a chamber, and lays initial eggs that develop into workers, transitioning the colony from claustral to mature phase. In termites, queens undergo physogastry, a dramatic abdominal swelling due to ovarian hypertrophy, enabling sustained high-volume egg production—up to tens of thousands annually in mature colonies—while kings contribute sperm without similar morphological changes.\n\nThe evolutionary persistence of queen-worker dimorphism aligns with Hamilton's rule for kin selection (*rB \\u003e C*), where worker altruism toward siblings outweighs personal reproduction costs, amplified in Hymenoptera by haplodiploid sex determination that elevates female relatedness asymmetry (sisters share 75% genes via mother). Colony survival rates empirically link to queen longevity, with queens outliving workers by orders of magnitude—up to 30 years in some species—due to reduced foraging risks and nutritional support, directly impacting colony persistence.\n\nHuman-managed colonies in apiculture depend on queen quality for productivity, as healthy queens sustain worker populations essential for pollination services; honey bees contribute to approximately one-third of global crop production volume, including fruits, vegetables, and nuts. Historical agricultural reliance on such colonies dates to ancient practices, with modern data affirming their role in enhancing yields without which food security would decline.\n\n### In other organisms\n\nIn eusocial mammals such as the naked mole-rat (*Heterocephalus glaber*), a single reproductive female, termed the queen, monopolizes breeding within the colony, suppressing ovulation in subordinate females through pheromonal and behavioral mechanisms. The queen is physically larger than non-breeders, exhibits elongated vertebrae to accommodate multiple pregnancies, and can produce litters of up to 28 pups multiple times per year, with colonies consisting of 70-300 individuals divided into castes including workers and soldiers. Succession occurs via aggressive challenges, often resulting in the death of the incumbent queen, ensuring only the most dominant female reproduces. Similar dynamics exist in the Damaraland mole-rat (*Fukomys damarensis*), where a single queen pairs with one to three breeding males, maintaining reproductive skew through dominance hierarchies.\n\nIn cooperative breeding species like meerkats (*Suricata suricatta*), the dominant female, often called the queen or matriarch, enforces a breeding monopoly by evicting or infanticidally eliminating subordinates attempting to reproduce, leading to an average of 70 pups over her tenure. She sustains dominance through elevated androgen levels—sometimes twice that of males—enabling aggressive behaviors such as biting and shoving to suppress rivals, while subordinates contribute to pup care and sentinel duties. Dominant females grow larger during their reign compared to subordinate periods, reflecting adaptive size modification tied to resource access and reproductive success. This hierarchy enhances group cohesion but imposes costs, including higher parasite loads on the queen from increased territorial patrols.\n\n## Games and pastimes\n\n### Chess\n\nIn chess, the queen is the most powerful piece, capable of moving any number of unoccupied squares vertically, horizontally, or diagonally in a single turn, combining the movements of the rook and bishop. This versatility allows it to control up to 27 squares from a central position, far exceeding other pieces. Its standard material value is assessed at nine points, equivalent to approximately nine pawns, though this can vary slightly by position and game phase.\n\nThe queen's modern capabilities emerged in Europe during the late 15th century, evolving from the weaker \"fers\" or \"ferz\" of medieval chess variants like shatranj, which could move only one square diagonally. This transformation, part of the \"Queen's Chess\" or \"Mad Queen\" variant, granted the piece unrestricted rook- and bishop-like powers, dramatically accelerating gameplay and favoring aggressive tactics over the slower medieval forms. By the 1490s, treatises such as those by Spanish players Lucena and Damiano documented these rules, solidifying the queen's dominance in what became international chess.\n\nStrategically, the queen excels in controlling the center, restricting opponent mobility, and supporting attacks, though premature development in openings often proves risky due to potential traps. In endgames, a centralized queen maximizes checks and square coverage, complicating defenses and favoring the side with better coordination. A famous example is Garry Kasparov's 1999 game against Veselin Topalov at the Wijk aan Zee tournament, where Kasparov sacrificed his queen on move 24 (Qxh6) in a tactical sequence that dismantled Black's position through discovered attacks and mate threats, securing victory in 45 moves.\n\nIn chess variants, equivalents vary: xiangqi's advisor moves one square diagonally like the ancient fers, rendering it far weaker and confined near the general. Shogi lacks a direct queen but features promoted pieces—the dragon king (promoted rook with added king-like adjacency) and dragon horse (promoted bishop with added forward jump)—which approximate queen mobility when combined.\n\n### Playing cards\n\nIn a standard 52-card French-suited deck, the queen is one of three court cards per suit—hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades—ranking below the king and above the jack, depicted as a stylized female figure in historical European attire, often shown in profile holding a scepter, flower, or book to denote authority. These designs emerged in 15th-century Europe, with French standardization in the late 1480s introducing simplified, standing poses for the courts to facilitate mass production via woodblocks, replacing earlier Italian and German patterns that sometimes omitted queens in favor of knights or additional male figures. While folklore attributes specific identities—such as Judith from the biblical Book of Judith to the queen of hearts, Pallas Athena to spades, Rachel to diamonds, and the anagrammatic \"Argine\" (regina) to clubs—these courts in English and international patterns carry no official names or confirmed historical portraits, serving instead as generic symbols of feminine royalty.\n\nThe queen embodies themes of power, wisdom, and balanced femininity in card symbolism, contrasting the king's martial authority while evoking grace and strategic insight, a duality rooted in the deck's evolution from medieval courtly hierarchies. In gameplay, queens function as high-value cards essential for building strong hands; in poker variants like Texas Hold'em, a pair of queens ranks as the third-strongest starting pair after aces and kings, often securing pots unless outdrawn by higher cards or sets. In contract bridge, each queen contributes 2 high-card points in the standard 4-3-2-1 valuation system (ace=4, king=3, jack=1), aiding bid evaluation for tricks and contracts, though their utility depends on suit position and distribution. Collectible decks may vary queen motifs for artistic or thematic purposes, but the core mechanics prioritize the standard deck's uniform ranking across suits.\n\n### Other games\n\nIn various draughts variants, including international draughts, a piece promoted upon reaching the opponent's king row becomes a queen, capable of moving any number of unoccupied squares diagonally in any direction, both forward and backward, thereby enabling long-range maneuvers and captures akin to those of a chess queen but confined to diagonal paths. This promotion, sometimes termed a \"flying king\" in English-language American checkers, significantly enhances the piece's tactical value, as it can chain multiple jumps over enemy pieces during a single turn, provided landing squares are available immediately beyond each captured piece. In standard play, queens must capture if possible, prioritizing sequences that maximize the number of taken pieces, which underscores their role as dominant endgame assets.\n\nQueendomino, a 2017 tile-laying board game designed by Bruno Cathala and Nobuko Kitaka, incorporates \"queen\" thematically as players draft and place domino-shaped tiles to develop domains, construct buildings, and earn the queen's favor through quests and city scoring, blending kingdom-building mechanics with resource allocation for 2-4 players. The game's expansion potential and strategic depth, evidenced by its integration with predecessor King of Tokyo elements, position it as a notable modern instance of queen-centric gameplay in abstract strategy titles.\n\n## Arts and entertainment\n\n### Music\n\nQueen is a British rock band formed in London in 1970 by guitarist Brian May, singer Freddie Mercury, and drummer Roger Taylor, with bassist John Deacon joining in 1971. The group signed with EMI Records and released their self-titled debut album on July 13, 1973, featuring heavy rock influences and multi-layered vocals that foreshadowed their signature sound.\n\nThe band's breakthrough came with the 1975 album *A Night at the Opera*, which included the six-minute single \"Bohemian Rhapsody,\" blending operatic sections, balladry, and hard rock; by 2023, the track had amassed over 2 billion combined streams across platforms. Their July 13, 1985, performance at Live Aid—featuring hits like \"Radio Ga Ga,\" \"Hammer to Fall,\" and \"We Are the Champions\" in a 20-minute set—has been ranked the greatest live rock performance in polls, including a 2023 UK survey where it garnered 35% of votes ahead of other iconic sets. Queen achieved global commercial dominance, with certified sales exceeding 250 million records worldwide by the early 2020s, driven by multi-platinum albums like *Greatest Hits* (1981), which sold over 25 million copies.\n\nFreddie Mercury died on November 24, 1991, from bronchial pneumonia resulting from AIDS, after which the band ceased original recordings but maintained activity through compilations and live revivals. Since 2011, surviving members May, Taylor, and Deacon (with Spike Edney on keyboards) have toured as Queen + Adam Lambert, performing over 200 shows and grossing tens of millions annually, revitalizing their catalog through modern production and Lambert's vocal range. In June 2024, the band's recorded music rights, publishing, and name/likeness were sold to Sony Music for £1 billion (approximately $1.27 billion), the largest such catalog transaction to date, reflecting sustained revenue from streaming and licensing exceeding $49 million annually.\n\nCritics in the 1970s often accused Queen of theatrical excess and overproduction, dismissing their operatic flair and genre-blending as pompous or derivative amid punk's rise, with some reviews labeling albums like *A Night at the Opera* as bloated. This view persisted in pockets of rock journalism, yet empirical metrics counter it: Queen's influence is evident in Metallica's cover of their 1974 track \"Stone Cold Crazy\" (which won a Grammy in 1991) and Lady Gaga's repeated citations of Mercury as a stylistic inspiration for her theatrical pop.  Their six UK number-one albums, 18 top-ten singles, and enduring chart resurgences—such as *Greatest Hits* topping UK charts in 2022—demonstrate broad appeal beyond niche critique.\n\n### Film, television, and theater\n\nThe 1998 film *Elizabeth*, directed by Shekhar Kapur, depicts the early reign of Elizabeth I of England (1558–1603), focusing on her consolidation of power amid religious conflicts and plots, with Cate Blanchett in the title role; the film received Academy Award nominations for Best Actress, Best Cinematography, and others. Its 2007 sequel, *Elizabeth: The Golden Age*, continued the portrayal of Elizabeth I's defense against the Spanish Armada, earning nominations for Best Actress and Best Costume Design. These biopics emphasize political intrigue but have drawn critique for compressing timelines and amplifying personal rivalries over the causal realities of Elizabethan governance and religious policy enforcement.\n\nIn *The Queen* (2006), directed by Stephen Frears, Helen Mirren portrays Elizabeth II navigating public backlash to her family's restrained response following Princess Diana's death on August 31, 1997; the film highlights tensions between royal protocol and media-driven public sentiment, grossing $123 million worldwide and securing Mirren the Academy Award for Best Actress along with five other Oscar nominations.  *The Favourite* (2018), directed by Yorgos Lanthimos, examines Queen Anne's (1665–1714) court through rivalries among her confidantes, with Olivia Colman winning the Academy Award for Best Actress for her depiction of the monarch's physical decline and emotional volatility; the film, while nominated for seven Oscars, prioritizes satirical interpersonal dynamics over the broader geopolitical duties of the War of the Spanish Succession era.\n\nThe Netflix series *The Crown* (2016–2023), spanning six seasons, dramatizes the reign of Elizabeth II from 1947 onward, employing multiple actresses including Claire Foy (seasons 1–2), Olivia Colman (3–4), and Imelda Staunton (5–6) to cover her life; praised for production values and performances, it amassed 21 Emmy wins but faced accusations of fabricating events—such as exaggerated depictions of private royal conversations—to heighten scandal, reflecting entertainment media's tendency to favor personal dysfunction narratives over empirical records of institutional continuity.  \n\nIn theater, *Six* (premiered 2017 at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, transferring to West End and Broadway), reimagines Henry VIII's six wives—Catherine of Aragon, Anne Boleyn, Jane Seymour, Anne of Cleves, Catherine Howard, and Catherine Parr—as contemporary pop performers competing to outshine one another, emphasizing individual agency over historical victimhood; the production has achieved commercial success, with Broadway runs grossing over $100 million by 2023 and earning the 2019 Olivier Award for Best New Musical.  Such adaptations, while empirically boosting audience engagement through modern empowerment tropes, often sideline causal historical factors like dynastic imperatives and Tudor religious reforms in favor of ahistorical empowerment arcs.\n\n### Literature and fictional characters\n\nIn literature, queens frequently serve as archetypes symbolizing sovereignty, maternal influence, and the exercise of authority, often exploring tensions between benevolent stewardship and tyrannical abuse of power. These portrayals draw from historical precedents and imaginative constructs, revealing causal patterns where personal virtues or flaws—such as prudence versus vanity—determine the stability of rule, independent of gender. Fictional queens thus illustrate first-principles of governance: effective leadership requires alignment of self-interest with communal order, while deviations foster instability, as seen across genres from fairy tales to epic fantasy.\n\nThe Evil Queen in the Brothers Grimm's \"Snow White,\" published in their 1812 collection *Kinder- und Hausmärchen*, embodies destructive tyranny rooted in envy and narcissism; she consults a magic mirror obsessively, orders her stepdaughter's heart and lungs harvested for consumption, and ultimately poisons her with an apple, reflecting realistic pathologies of insecure rulers who prioritize self-preservation over ethical restraint. This character's downfall via her own disguised attempts underscores causal realism: tyrannies sustained by deception collapse when deception rebounds, a pattern unvarnished by moralizing overlays in the original tale.\n\nLewis Carroll's White Queen in *Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There*, first printed on November 18, 1871, contrasts as an ineffectual yet kindly monarch in a chessboard realm, shouting retroactively to evade threats and offering Alice nonsensical counsel on time and memory, satirizing arbitrary power structures detached from empirical logic. Her portrayal critiques benevolent but incoherent authority, where good intentions fail without coherent causality, positioning her as a foil to more decisive literary rulers.\n\nIn historical fiction, Hilary Mantel's *Wolf Hall* (2009), narrated through Thomas Cromwell's perspective, depicts Tudor queens like Anne Boleyn as ambitious navigators of patriarchal courts, leveraging intellect and alliances to ascend but succumbing to Henry VIII's volatile favor, highlighting how queens' influence hinges on male consent rather than autonomous dominion. This realist lens exposes power dynamics as transactional, with Boleyn's execution in 1536 illustrating the fragility of female regality amid monarchical absolutism.\n\nGeorge R.R. Martin's *A Game of Thrones* (1996), the first volume of *A Song of Ice and Fire*, features Daenerys Targaryen rising from exile to queen of conquered cities via dragons and armies, initially framed as a liberator abolishing slavery in Astapor on July 299 AC but later enforcing rule through fear and execution, demonstrating how conquest's exigencies erode principled governance into autocracy. Her arc substantiates that benevolent intentions yield to tyrannical methods under survival pressures, a dynamic grounded in historical analogies of empire-building rather than idealized heroism.\n\n### Video games and other media\n\nIn the multiplayer first-person shooter *Overwatch 2*, Junker Queen (Odessa \"Dez\" Stone) serves as a tank hero introduced on June 28, 2022, specializing in close-range melee combat with her magnetic axe *Magnetic Scrap Gun* for throwing and retrieving scrap metal, a *Wound* ability that applies bleeding damage-over-time effects, and *Carnage* ultimate that boosts her health and damage while healing nearby allies through proximity. As the ruler of the anarchic Junkertown, her gameplay emphasizes aggressive brawling and self-sustain, with a playstyle that rewards precise axe throws and crowd control via her *Commanding Shout* ability, which temporarily increases ally health and movement speed; she has maintained a consistent presence in competitive metas due to her high mobility and disruption potential, evidenced by top-tier pick rates in professional tournaments like the Overwatch Champions Series.\n\nIn the real-time strategy series *StarCraft II*, Zerg Queens function as early-game utility units introduced in the 2010 expansion *Wings of Liberty*, capable of spawning additional larva from hatcheries to accelerate army production, healing allied structures and units with acidic bile streams, and spreading creep tumors to expand controllable terrain. These flying, multi-purpose bioforms, costing 50 minerals and requiring a spawning pool, enable defensive macro plays and early harassment, with advanced strategies like \"Queen rush\" variants demonstrated in professional matches where massed Queens overwhelm opponents before mid-game transitions. Their design promotes resource-efficient swarm tactics, contributing to the Zerg faction's emphasis on biological adaptation and overwhelming numbers.\n\nThe arcade multiplayer game *Killer Queen*, launched in 2013, features the Queen as the core playable unit for each five-player team, tasked with riding a giant snail to capture a key or berry resource while workers hop on backs to support scoring; the Queen's agility allows evasion and direct engagement, but vulnerability to opposing swarms necessitates coordinated team defense. This hybrid physical-digital format, blending strategy and physical movement across a 10x50-foot board, has influenced esports with tournaments drawing crowds for its unique queen-centric objectives, where victory hinges on the Queen's survival and resource denial.\n\nOther notable queen characters include the Shadow Queen, a demonic antagonist in the 2004 role-playing game *Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door*, who possesses princess Peach and demands star sacrifices in ritual combat, featuring boss mechanics involving shadow clones and possession attacks that test player timing and partner switches. In *Deltarune* (Chapter 2, 2021), Queen operates as a digital overlord antagonist with quirky, AI-themed dialogue and vehicle-based battles, critiquing cyberculture through puzzles and combat phases that escalate to mech summons, impacting narrative themes of control and friendship in the game's metaverse. These portrayals highlight queens as powerful, often villainous figures driving interactive narratives and mechanics centered on dominance and strategy.\n\n## Places and geography\n\n### Settlements and regions\n\nQueens is a borough of New York City established in 1683 as one of the original counties of the Province of New York, named in honor of Catherine of Braganza, the Portuguese-born queen consort of King Charles II of England. The area, originally settled by Dutch colonists in the 1630s near Flushing Bay, encompasses diverse neighborhoods such as Jamaica and Flushing, serving as a major economic hub with industries including transportation, healthcare, and retail. As of July 1, 2024, Queens had an estimated population of 2,316,841 residents, reflecting its role as one of the most ethnically diverse urban areas globally, with significant immigrant communities from Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean contributing to its cultural and economic vitality.\n\nQueenstown, located in South Africa's Eastern Cape Province, was founded in 1853 as a British military outpost by Sir George Cathcart during the Frontier Wars to protect settlers from Xhosa attacks; it was named after Queen Victoria. The town developed into a regional service center for agriculture and trade, featuring a distinctive hexagonal street layout designed for defensive purposes. Renamed Komani in 2016 to reflect local Xhosa heritage derived from the nearby Komani River, the urban area had a population of approximately 98,988 as of the 2011 census, with ongoing growth in nearby townships.\n\nQueenstown, Maryland, in Queen Anne's County on the Eastern Shore, traces its origins to European settlement in the 1640s, with formal establishment around 1707 as the original county seat; the name derives from the county's dedication to Queen Anne of Great Britain, who reigned from 1702 to 1714. Positioned strategically near waterways, it served administrative and trade functions until the county seat relocated to Centreville in the 19th century, after which it evolved into a small community focused on agriculture and local commerce.\n\n### Natural features and landmarks\n\nThe **Queen Charlotte Islands**, now officially known as Haida Gwaii, form an archipelago off the northern coast of British Columbia, Canada, comprising over 150 islands with a total land area of approximately 10,000 square kilometers. Captain George Dixon named the group in 1787 during his survey expedition, honoring his ship *Queen Charlotte*, which was itself named for Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, queen consort to King George III of Great Britain.  This naming reflected British exploratory practices of the era, where features were designated after royal figures to commemorate patronage and assert navigational precedence amid fur trade rivalries with other European powers. The islands' renaming to Haida Gwaii in 2010 acknowledged the indigenous Haida people's longstanding territorial claims and cultural significance, though the historical eponym persists in some geographical references.\n\n**Queen Maud Land** encompasses a vast sector of East Antarctica, spanning about 2.7 million square kilometers between 20°W and 45°E longitude, characterized by ice shelves, nunataks, and the Fimbulheimen mountain range. Norwegian explorers under Hjalmar Riiser-Larsen first charted the region during the 1930–1931 expedition, naming it after Maud of Wales, queen consort to King Haakon VII of Norway from 1905 to 1938. Norway formalized its territorial claim on January 14, 1939, via royal decree, integrating the area into its Antarctic dependencies as a means of securing whaling interests and polar sovereignty amid international competition. The designation underscored colonial-era conventions of eponymy, where monarchs' names facilitated diplomatic assertions over unclaimed polar expanses, though the region's status remains governed by the 1959 Antarctic Treaty, prohibiting new claims or militarization.\n\nThe **Queen Elizabeth Islands**, the northern cluster of Canada's Arctic Archipelago, cover roughly 419,000 square kilometers across 36 major islands north of Viscount Melville Sound, including Axel Heiberg, Ellesmere, and Devon Islands, dominated by ice caps and fjords. Previously termed the Parry Islands after explorer William Parry's 1819–1820 voyages, the group was renamed in 1953 by Canadian Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent to honor Queen Elizabeth II following her coronation on June 2 that year, with her explicit consent.  This re-designation aligned with mid-20th-century Commonwealth naming traditions, linking remote, strategically vital territories—explored for sovereignty reinforcement during the Cold War—to the reigning monarch, thereby embedding royal symbolism in post-colonial geographical nomenclature.\n\n## Religion, mythology, and folklore\n\n### Divine and mythical queens\n\nIn ancient Egyptian religion, Isis emerged as a prominent goddess titled Queen of Heaven, embodying motherhood, magic, and resurrection; she was the sister and consort of Osiris, credited with reassembling his dismembered body and conceiving Horus, with her cult peaking during the New Kingdom around 1550–1070 BCE. Her attributes included celestial sovereignty, as depicted in temple reliefs at Philae where she nursed pharaohs as divine protector.\n\nMesopotamian traditions venerated Inanna (Sumerian) or Ishtar (Akkadian) as Queen of Heaven from the third millennium BCE, a multifaceted deity of love, war, and fertility whose worship involved ritual cakes and libations, as evidenced in cuneiform texts like the Descent of Inanna. This cult influenced neighboring regions, appearing in Canaanite contexts as Astarte, but remained tied to local astral and agricultural cycles without direct causation to later monotheistic adaptations.\n\nIn Greek mythology, Hera functioned as queen of the Olympian gods, wed to Zeus and patroness of marriage and women, with her epithet \"ox-eyed\" reflecting epic descriptions in Homer's Iliad circa 8th century BCE; her temples, such as the Heraion at Argos founded around 900 BCE, hosted festivals emphasizing her regal authority over the heavens. The Roman equivalent, Juno, mirrored this role as Jupiter's consort and state protectress, invoked in inaugural rites from the Regal period onward. These figures arose from Indo-European kinship structures privileging divine hierarchy, distinct from Near Eastern fertility emphases.\n\nThe Hebrew prophet Jeremiah, writing circa 626–586 BCE, condemned Israelite worship of the \"Queen of Heaven\" in Jerusalem and Judah, describing family rituals of baking cakes and pouring libations to this pagan goddess, likely Astarte or a syncretic form of Ishtar/Asherah, whose cult persisted despite prophetic warnings and contributed to societal decline per biblical accounts. Archaeological finds, including incense altars from 7th-century BCE Judahite sites, corroborate such practices as deviations from Yahwistic monotheism.\n\nCatholic doctrine designates the Virgin Mary as Queen of Heaven, formalized in Pope Pius XII's 1954 encyclical *Ad Caeli Reginam*, grounding the title in her Assumption and maternal intercession for Christ the King, analogous to Old Testament gebirah (queen mothers) like Bathsheba advising Solomon in 1 Kings 2; this theological development, attested in 4th-century liturgies, rejects pagan derivations despite critics' claims of continuity. Protestant and evangelical sources maintain the Jeremiah reference exclusively denotes idolatry, underscoring no biblical warrant for Marian queenship.\n\nIn European folklore, Guinevere embodies a mythical queen as King Arthur's consort in medieval legends originating with Geoffrey of Monmouth's *Historia Regum Britanniae* (1136 CE), where her abduction by Melwas symbolizes sovereignty disputes; later cycles, such as Chrétien de Troyes' 12th-century romances, portray her in adulterous ties to Lancelot, reflecting feudal tensions over loyalty and lineage rather than divine attributes. trace her to Welsh Gwalchmei variants, emphasizing narrative evolution over deification.)\n\n### Religious titles and figures\n\nIn the Hebrew Bible, the title *gebirah* (translated as \"queen mother\" or \"great lady\") referred to the mother of the reigning king in the Kingdom of Judah, signifying her official role and influence in the royal court. This position appears 15 times in the Old Testament, often denoting advisory authority, as seen with Bathsheba, mother of Solomon, who interceded on behalf of petitioners before her son (1 Kings 2:17–19). The *gebirah* was distinct from the king's wife and held a formal seat of honor, reflecting ancient Near Eastern customs where the mother advised on state matters.\n\nThe Queen of Sheba emerges as a key figure in Abrahamic religious texts, described in 1 Kings 10:1–13 as a ruler from the kingdom of Sheba (likely in modern Yemen) who visited King Solomon circa 950 BCE to test his renowned wisdom with riddles. She arrived with a caravan bearing 120 talents of gold, large quantities of spices, and precious stones, establishing trade links that enriched Israel, and departed impressed by Solomon's God-given insight, praising Yahweh (1 Kings 10:9). Her narrative, paralleled in 2 Chronicles 9 and Islamic tradition as Bilqis in the Quran (Surah 27), underscores themes of divine wisdom and cross-cultural exchange, with archaeological evidence confirming the Sabaean kingdom's wealth in spices and gold during the 10th–8th centuries BCE.\n\nIn Catholic doctrine, the Virgin Mary bears the title Queen of Apostles (*Regina Apostolorum*), honoring her maternal guidance over the nascent Church and presence with the Apostles in the Upper Room at Pentecost (Acts 1:14). This honorific, included in the Litany of Loreto approved by Pope Sixtus V in 1587, stems from early Church tradition viewing Mary as cooperating in the Apostles' mission by interceding for the Holy Spirit's descent. The feast of Mary, Queen of Apostles, observed on May 31 in some traditions, emphasizes her role in evangelization, as articulated by theologians like Fr. James Alberione, who described her as distributing graces to apostles across eras.\n\n## Transportation and engineering\n\n### Ships and vehicles\n\nThe RMS *Queen Mary*, an ocean liner constructed for the Cunard-White Star Line, was launched on September 27, 1934, at the John Brown \\u0026 Company shipyard in Clydebank, Scotland, with a gross tonnage of 81,237 and capacity for 2,139 passengers plus crew. She commenced her maiden voyage from Southampton to New York on May 27, 1936, and in August 1938 captured the Blue Riband for the fastest eastbound transatlantic crossing at an average speed of 30.99 knots. During World War II, following conversion in 1940, she served as a troopship under Allied control, transporting over 800,000 military personnel across more than 569 voyages totaling 600,000 miles without a single combat loss, demonstrating her strategic value beyond peacetime luxury service through reinforced hull plating, anti-aircraft armament, and high-capacity berthing for up to 15,000 troops.  Cunard retired her on December 9, 1967, after which the City of Long Beach, California, acquired her for $3.45 million to serve as a museum ship and hotel, where she remains permanently moored.\n\nHer sister ship, the RMS *Queen Elizabeth*, launched in 1938 with similar dimensions and engineering—featuring quadruple-expansion steam engines driving four propellers for a service speed of 28.5 knots—entered service in 1940 after wartime fitting-out as a troop carrier. She paralleled the *Queen Mary*'s military role, ferrying over 750,000 troops and participating in operations like the D-Day buildup, before resuming commercial transatlantic and world cruises postwar until retirement in 1968; she was destroyed by fire in Hong Kong's Victoria Harbour on January 9, 1972, while slated for conversion to a seagoing university.\n\nThe *Queen Elizabeth 2* (QE2), launched by Cunard in 1967 and entering service on May 2, 1969, marked a shift to turbine propulsion with a gross tonnage of 70,327 and accommodations for 1,777 passengers, achieving speeds up to 32.6 knots on diesel-electric and gas turbine power. She completed 1,691 crossings and numerous luxury cruises until her final voyage on November 27, 2008, after which she became a floating hotel in Cape Town before relocation to Dubai.\n\nCunard's modern fleet continues the naming tradition with ocean liners and cruise vessels like the *Queen Mary 2* (launched 2003, in service since January 12, 2004), the last true transatlantic liner at 148,528 gross tons and capable of 30 knots, recapturing the Blue Riband in 2004; *Queen Victoria* (2007, 90,049 tons); *Queen Elizabeth* (2010, 90,901 tons); and *Queen Anne* (2024, 113,000 tons), all emphasizing advanced stabilizers, propulsion efficiency, and capacity for over 2,000 passengers each in luxury configurations. \n\nAmong land vehicles, the Queen was a short-lived American automobile marque produced from 1904 to 1906 by the C.H. Blomstrom Motor Company in Detroit, Michigan, featuring models like the 1906 Queen Model E—a two-cylinder, 20-horsepower touring car with tiller steering and chain drive, exemplifying early 20th-century engineering simplicity in a market dominated by larger firms, with production limited to fewer than 100 units.\n\n### Other transport-related uses\n\nThe Great Western Railway introduced a steam locomotive named *The Queen* in 1897, specifically designed and adorned with royal insignia, including the coat of arms, for conveying Queen Victoria between Windsor and London Paddington. This 57-foot-long engine pulled dedicated royal carriages on the route, marking an early example of bespoke rail transport for imperial travel.\n\nIn the 20th century, the London, Midland and Scottish Railway's Duchess Class (also known as Princess Coronation Class) 4-6-2 Pacific locomotives included units named after queens, such as No. 46222 *Queen Mary*, built in 1936 with a top speed capability of 126 mph (203 km/h) for express passenger services, and No. 6221 *Queen Elizabeth*, entering service in 1937 for high-speed mainline duties. These engines featured streamlined bodies, four cylinders, and were withdrawn between 1961 and 1964 amid the shift to diesel and electric traction, with *Queen Mary* preserved at the National Railway Museum.\n\nThe Elizabeth line, a major rapid transit railway in Greater London, was renamed in 2016 to honor Queen Elizabeth II and fully opened on 24 May 2022, spanning 100 km with 41 stations and serving up to 1.5 million passengers daily using Class 345 trains operated at speeds up to 140 km/h.\n\nIn aviation, the Beechcraft Queen Air series comprises twin-engine light utility aircraft, with the initial Model 65 variant certified on 12 September 1961 after a first flight in 1958, featuring all-metal construction, a cruising speed of 200 knots (370 km/h), and production totaling around 903 units across variants like the pressurized A80 until cessation in 1978. These aircraft, powered by 340–380 hp Lycoming engines, supported roles in general aviation, cargo, and executive transport, evolving into the turboprop King Air lineage.\n\n## Other uses\n\n### Slang, idioms, and cultural references\n\nIn slang usage, \"drama queen\" refers to a person, often derogatorily applied to women or effeminate men, who exaggerates emotional responses or creates unnecessary theatrics over minor issues, with the term's earliest recorded appearance in 1923 in *The Washington Post*. This expression emerged in the early 20th century, initially within urban subcultures including gay communities where it described overly histrionic behavior, reflecting observed patterns of attention-seeking rather than inherent gender traits. Similarly, \"queen\" as slang denotes an effeminate or flamboyant gay man, deriving from the late-17th-century term \"quean\" for a prostitute or impudent woman, evolving by the 1920s to specifically label homosexual men exhibiting feminine mannerisms in a pejorative sense, though later reclaimed in some LGBTQ+ contexts.\n\nThe idiom \"queen bee\" describes a dominant woman who asserts control over a group of subordinates, often by undermining rivals to maintain her position, analogous to the biological role of the honeybee queen as the sole reproductive female in a hive, with figurative use attested by 1807. This term highlights hierarchical dynamics in female social structures, where empirical observations in workplaces and schools show dominant individuals suppressing peers' advancement, challenging egalitarian assumptions by aligning with evolutionary patterns of resource competition and status signaling observed in eusocial insects and human groups.\n\nCulturally, \"queen\" evokes beauty pageants featuring \"beauty queens,\" such as Miss Universe, established in 1952 by Pacific Knitting Mills to promote swimwear sales, which has since generated substantial economic activity through tourism, sponsorships, and media exposure, with individual events yielding impacts like $80–200 million in host economies via visitor spending and infrastructure boosts. These contests emphasize physical standards and poise, drawing from mid-20th-century ideals of femininity tied to market-driven aesthetics rather than abstract empowerment narratives.\n\n### Brands, products, and miscellaneous\n\nQueen Fine Foods is an Australian company founded in 1897, specializing in baking aids such as pure vanilla extracts, essences, food colorings, and related products, positioning itself as the country's leading producer in these categories. The brand offers a range of items including flavorings, syrups, and decorations, with annual production emphasizing quality vanilla sourced and endorsed historically.\n\nBrian May Guitars, launched in collaboration with Queen's guitarist Brian May, produces electric guitars like the BMG Special, replicating designs from his custom Red Special used in the band's recordings, with models featuring premium woods and official artwork tied to Queen's legacy. These instruments target collectors and musicians, incorporating vintage-inspired elements such as antique cherry finishes.\n\nThe \"Queen\" chess engine, developed by Leen Ammeraal, is a WinBoard- and UCI-compliant program written in C++, employing principal variation search and transposition tables for gameplay analysis and competition. It supports advanced features for chess enthusiasts, including post-game evaluation tools in related software variants.\n\nIn June 2024, the estate of the rock band Queen sold its recorded music catalog, publishing rights, and merchandising interests to Sony Music for approximately $1.27 billion, marking one of the largest such transactions in music history and enabling expanded production of band-branded apparel, collectibles, and accessories under new ownership. This deal encompasses rights to iconic imagery and trademarks, facilitating ongoing global merchandise sales estimated in the tens of millions annually prior to the transfer.",
