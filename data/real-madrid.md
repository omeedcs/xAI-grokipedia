# Real Madrid CF

Real Madrid Club de Fútbol, commonly referred to as Real Madrid, is a professional association football club based in Madrid, Spain, that competes in La Liga, the premier division of Spanish football. Founded on 6 March 1902 as Madrid Football Club, the team has amassed a record 36 La Liga titles and a record 15 UEFA Champions League trophies, establishing it as the most decorated club in European football history by major honors. Unlike many elite clubs structured as private companies, Real Madrid operates as a member-owned association governed by its socios, who elect the president and influence key decisions.

The club's defining era began under president Santiago Bernabéu in the mid-20th century, when strategic signings like Alfredo Di Stéfano propelled five consecutive European Cup victories from 1956 to 1960, laying the foundation for its global dominance and the "Galácticos" policy of acquiring superstar players in later decades. Real Madrid plays home games at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, an 83,000-capacity venue completed in 1947 and recently renovated at a cost exceeding €1.3 billion to include modern retractable roofs, enhanced facilities, and increased revenue potential. Under long-serving president Florentino Pérez since 2009, the club has secured five additional Champions League titles, though its aggressive spending on transfers has drawn scrutiny over financial sustainability amid European regulatory pressures. These achievements, coupled with rivalries like El Clásico against FC Barcelona, underscore Real Madrid's role as a cultural and sporting institution, often leveraging its prestige for commercial ventures while navigating periodic controversies over governance and political associations during Spain's Franco era.
## History

### Foundation and early development (1902–1939)

Madrid Foot Ball Club was officially founded on March 6, 1902, when its first board of directors was elected under the presidency of Juan Padrós, who, along with his brother Carlos and other enthusiasts from the disbanded Foot-Ball Club Sky, formalized the entity to promote organized football in Madrid. The club's origins trace to informal gatherings initiated around 1900 by Julián Palacios, reflecting growing interest in association football among Madrid's youth, influenced by British expatriates and students returning from abroad with exposure to the sport. Initial activities centered on friendly matches and regional tournaments, with the team adopting white kits inspired by Corinthian F.C. and playing its earliest home games at the modest Campo de Jorge Juan field.

The club participated in its first competitive fixture on May 13, 1902, during the Copa de la Coronación—a precursor to the Copa del Rey—where it faced FC Barcelona in the semifinals, suffering a 1–3 defeat amid a tournament organized to celebrate King Alfonso XIII's coronation. Early development emphasized regional dominance in Madrid and participation in national cups, yielding successes including multiple Copa del Rey titles in the 1900s and 1910s, though exact counts varied with tournament formats. Infrastructure advanced with the acquisition of Campo de O'Donnell in 1912 as a dedicated home ground, accommodating growing attendance, followed by a shift to the Velódromo de Chamartín for shared use before the inauguration of the purpose-built Estadio Chamartín on May 17, 1924, with an initial capacity of 15,000 spectators.

On June 29, 1920, King Alfonso XIII conferred the "Real" (royal) designation upon the club via a letter to president Pedro Parages, elevating its status and incorporating a crown into the crest, a patronage reflecting the monarchy's support for cultural institutions. As Real Madrid Club de Fútbol, it entered Spain's inaugural professional league season in 1929, debuting on February 10 against Europa at Chamartín and leading much of the campaign before a final-day loss to Athletic Bilbao cost the title, finishing second behind Barcelona. The pre-1939 era solidified the club's identity through consistent cup contention and league competitiveness, navigating amateur-to-professional transitions amid Spain's political turbulence, with membership growing to support operational stability under presidents like Adolfo Meléndez, who oversaw the Chamartín expansion.

### World War II and Franco regime era (1939–1978)

Following the Spanish Civil War, which concluded in 1939 with Francisco Franco's victory, Real Madrid faced severe financial strain and infrastructure damage at its Chamartín Stadium, limiting operations amid Spain's economic austerity and the regime's centralization efforts. The club resumed competitive play in La Liga, which continued uninterrupted despite wartime hardships, but achieved no titles until the late 1940s, reflecting broader recovery challenges rather than targeted favoritism.

Santiago Bernabéu, a former player and club director who had fought for Franco's Nationalists, was elected president on September 11, 1943, initiating a rebuilding phase focused on financial stabilization and facility upgrades. Under his leadership, construction of a new stadium—initially called Nuevo Chamartín—began with a groundbreaking on October 27, 1944, funded through club bonds and loans despite rationing and material shortages; it opened on December 14, 1947, with an initial capacity of over 80,000 spectators. This venue enabled larger attendances and revenue, supporting squad investments, and was expanded in phases through the 1950s to reach 125,000 capacity by 1957, including modern amenities like floodlights installed in 1952.

Domestic revival followed, with Real Madrid clinching its first post-war La Liga title in the 1947–48 season, ending a 16-year drought, followed by Copa del Generalísimo victories in 1947 and 1948 amid a squad built around players like Juan Alonso and Francisco Gento. The 1953 signing of Alfredo Di Stéfano marked a turning point; after a contractual dispute where Barcelona initially secured exclusive rights but an interim board resigned amid internal pressure, FIFA ruled for shared play between the clubs, but Barcelona renounced their claim, allowing Real Madrid to acquire him outright by purchasing Barcelona's share for approximately 4 million pesetas, bolstering the attack without substantiated direct intervention by Franco, though regime officials monitored the central club's interests. Di Stéfano's arrival, alongside later signings like Ferenc Puskás in 1958, fueled a golden era, with La Liga triumphs resuming in 1960–61 and five consecutive titles through 1964–65.

Internationally, Bernabéu championed the European Cup's inception in 1955, co-founding the competition to elevate Spanish football's global profile during the regime's post-World War II isolation, as Spain remained neutral but faced diplomatic ostracism until 1953. Real Madrid won the inaugural 1955–56 edition, defeating Reims 4–3 in the final on June 13, 1956, and secured four more consecutive victories through 1960, totaling five titles by 1960 with aggregate scores including 7–3 over Eintracht Frankfurt in the 1960 final, driven by Di Stéfano's 49 goals across those campaigns. These successes provided propaganda value to the regime, showcasing Spain's prowess abroad, yet lacked evidence of competitive rigging; Barcelona, for instance, captured four La Liga titles in the 1940s alone, and both clubs received state subsidies for stadium builds, including Camp Nou's expansion.

The 1960s and 1970s saw sustained domestic contention, with additional La Liga wins in 1966–67, 1967–68, 1968–69, 1971–72, 1974–75, 1975–76, and 1977–78, alongside six Copa del Rey triumphs, though intermittent slumps—like no European Cup after 1966 until later—highlighted merit-based fluctuations rather than systemic bias. Allegations of referee favoritism toward Real Madrid persist in partisan narratives, particularly from Catalan sources, but archival reviews show complaints from both clubs and no disproportionate penalties or awards favoring the capital side over rivals like Atlético Madrid or Valencia. Franco attended matches of multiple teams, including Barcelona, and the regime's use of Real Madrid's prestige was pragmatic—leveraging European victories for soft power—without altering on-field outcomes, as causal analysis prioritizes Bernabéu's managerial acumen, scouting, and infrastructure over unsubstantiated political rigging. Bernabéu's death on June 2, 1978, at age 82, capped an era of 37 major trophies, transitioning the club amid Spain's democratization post-Franco in 1975.

### Transition and domestic challenges (1978–2000)

Following the death of longtime president Santiago Bernabéu on 2 June 1978, Real Madrid transitioned to its first democratically elected leadership under Luis de Carlos, who assumed the presidency in September 1978 after winning the club's inaugural open election. This shift marked a broader democratization of the club amid Spain's post-Franco political liberalization, moving away from the era's centralized authority structures toward member-driven governance. De Carlos's tenure, lasting until May 1985, saw the club secure five major trophies, including the Copa del Rey in 1980 and 1982, and UEFA Cups in 1985 and 1986, alongside recognition as Europe's best team in 1980. However, domestically, Real Madrid endured a prolonged La Liga title drought from the 1979–80 season through 1984–85, finishing as runners-up multiple times amid inconsistent league form and managerial changes, including stints by Amancio Amaro and Luis Molowny.

The league struggles intensified fan and member discontent, contributing to de Carlos's resignation in 1985 despite the European successes, as the absence of domestic crowns—last won in 1978–79—highlighted tactical and squad depth issues against rising competitors like Athletic Bilbao and Barcelona. Ramón Mendoza succeeded de Carlos in May 1985, ushering in a revival through strategic signings such as Hugo Sánchez from Atlético Madrid and the promotion of the homegrown "Quinta del Buitre" group—Emilio Butragueño, Manolo Sanchís, Martín Vázquez, Miguel Pardeza (replacing the departed Míchel initially), and Míchel—centered on youth academy products who debuted prominently in the mid-1980s. This cohort powered five consecutive La Liga titles from 1985–86 to 1989–90, equaling the club's prior record set in the 1960s, with Sánchez scoring 208 goals in 282 appearances and Butragueño contributing 123 in 339.

Mendoza's era also included two additional UEFA Cups in 1985 and 1986, but European Cup campaigns faltered, with early exits underscoring defensive vulnerabilities exposed in domestic derbies. By the early 1990s, Barcelona's "Dream Team" under Johan Cruyff dominated La Liga, winning four straight titles from 1990–91 to 1993–94, while Real Madrid managed only sporadic successes like the 1994–95 league crown amid internal board tensions and mounting debts. Mendoza resigned in November 1995 following a heavy Clasico defeat to Barcelona, leaving behind unreported debts exceeding 13,000 million pesetas (approximately 72 million euros), exacerbated by overspending on transfers and stadium maintenance without corresponding revenue growth.

Lorenzo Sanz assumed the presidency in November 1995, prioritizing fiscal stabilization and European resurgence over immediate domestic dominance, appointing managers like Fabio Capello and later Jupp Heynckes. Under Sanz, Real Madrid clinched the 1996–97 La Liga title but faced ongoing challenges from Barcelona and Valencia, conceding the 1998–99 and 1999–2000 crowns despite squad investments in players like Clarence Seedorf and Roberto Carlos. The period's domestic inconsistencies—marked by mid-table threats in 1995–96 and reliance on aging stars—reflected squad transitions and tactical mismatches, though Sanz's tenure culminated in two UEFA Champions League triumphs in 1998 and 2000, ending a 32-year continental drought. These European highs contrasted with persistent league vulnerabilities, setting the stage for further reforms as member elections loomed in 2000.

### First Pérez presidency and Galácticos (2000–2006)

Florentino Pérez was elected as Real Madrid's president on July 16, 2000, defeating incumbent Lorenzo Sanz with over 55% of the votes in a poll driven by fan dissatisfaction with the club's financial state and on-pitch inconsistencies. To secure victory, Pérez pledged to sign Luís Figo from rivals Barcelona, a promise fulfilled shortly after with Figo's transfer for a then-record €60 million fee, marking the launch of the "Galácticos" strategy aimed at assembling superstar players to elevate commercial appeal and competitive edge. This approach prioritized high-profile acquisitions over squad balance, transforming Real Madrid into a global marketing powerhouse while inheriting a team that had just won the 1999–2000 UEFA Champions League under Sanz.

Under coach Vicente del Bosque, who remained from the prior regime until 2003, the Galácticos era yielded initial successes, including the 2000–01 La Liga title and the 2001 Supercopa de España. Pérez escalated spending with Zinedine Zidane's €77 million arrival from Juventus in 2001, the highest transfer fee ever at the time, followed by Ronaldo Nazário's €45 million move from Inter Milan in 2002 and David Beckham's €37 million signing from Manchester United in 2003. These additions fueled the 2001–02 UEFA Champions League triumph, sealed by Zidane's iconic volley in the final against Bayer Leverkusen, and the 2002 Intercontinental Cup, alongside the 2002–03 La Liga and Supercopa wins—Pérez's sole major honors in this period. Commercially, the policy boosted revenues through merchandising and sponsorships, stabilizing finances amid heavy outlays exceeding €200 million on transfers by 2003.

Post-2003, instability mounted as del Bosque departed amid reported tensions with Pérez's star-centric vision, which critics argued neglected defensive reinforcements and midfield depth, fostering egos and tactical incohesion. Successor Carlos Queiroz managed only the 2003 Supercopa before sacking in 2004 after a trophyless season marred by early Champions League exit, followed by rapid turnover: José Antonio Camacho (September 2004), Vanderlei Luxemburgo (December 2004), and interim Juan Ramón López Caro (2005–06). Real Madrid endured three consecutive barren league campaigns against Valencia and Barcelona's resurgence, culminating in a 2005–06 Champions League round-of-16 humiliation by Arsenal (aggregate 1–0).

Pérez resigned on February 27, 2006, accepting blame for on-field failures despite off-field gains, as rampant spending on aging icons failed to deliver sustained dominance and exposed squad vulnerabilities like overreliance on individual brilliance over collective structure. The era's legacy remains mixed: one Champions League and two La Ligas against three empty seasons, with financial prudence enabling Pérez's later return, though tactical critiques persist that the Galácticos prioritized spectacle over pragmatic team-building.

### Calderón interlude and instability (2006–2009)

Ramón Calderón was elected president of Real Madrid CF on July 2, 2006, securing 8,344 votes against rivals Juan Palacios and Juan Miguel Villar Mir, amid promises to sign young talents such as Cesc Fàbregas and Arjen Robben. Upon taking office, Calderón appointed Fabio Capello as head coach and Predrag Mijatović as sporting director, aiming to restore domestic competitiveness after two trophyless seasons under Florentino Pérez's Galácticos policy. Early controversies emerged over alleged irregularities in the election process, including claims of improper postal voting influence, though Calderón maintained power initially.

In the 2006–07 La Liga season, Capello's disciplined approach led Real Madrid to the title on the final day, finishing level on 76 points with Barcelona but prevailing on head-to-head record after a 4–1 win over Recreativo de Huelva. Key contributors included Ruud van Nistelrooy (23 goals) and a solid defense anchored by Fabio Cannavaro, but the campaign exposed squad tensions, with Capello criticizing the team's emphasis on "words not hard work" and benching stars like David Beckham initially before reintegrating him. Despite the league success, Real Madrid exited the UEFA Champions League in the round of 16 against Bayern Munich (aggregate 5–4 loss) and the Copa del Rey in the same stage, prompting Capello's dismissal in June 2007 despite the title, as Calderón sought a more attacking style amid boardroom clashes.

Bernd Schuster replaced Capello in July 2007, guiding the team to a second consecutive La Liga title in 2007–08 with 85 points, eight ahead of Villarreal, fueled by Raúl's 13 goals and a pivotal 1–0 Camp Nou victory that opened a seven-point lead. The season included signings like Wesley Sneijder and Arjen Robben, bolstering midfield creativity, though European form remained lackluster with another Champions League round-of-16 exit to Roma (aggregate 4–2 loss). Schuster's tenure initially stabilized results, but underlying issues surfaced, including failed pursuits of players like Andrés Iniesta and David Villa, and growing fan frustration over unfulfilled pre-election pledges.

The 2008–09 season marked deepening instability, as Real Madrid struggled post-Schuster's December 9 sacking following a 1–0 loss to Barcelona and his public admission that retaining the title was "impossible," with the team in fourth place after 15 games. Juande Ramos took over but won only six of 19 matches, culminating in a second-place La Liga finish (behind Barcelona) and another Champions League last-16 defeat to Liverpool (aggregate 1–0). Signings such as Klaas-Jan Huntelaar and Lassana Diarra failed to ignite form, while boardroom scandals intensified, including probes into manipulated votes at the December 2008 general assembly to confirm allies, eroding Calderón's support.

Calderón resigned on January 16, 2009, after 2 years and 198 days in office, citing pressures from the vote-rigging allegations and club unrest, which investigations later extended to his 2006 election victory. Vicente Boluda served as interim president until elections, highlighting the era's turbulence: two league titles masked chronic European underachievement, managerial turnover, and governance lapses that prioritized political maneuvering over sustained restructuring.

### Second Pérez era: Revival and European dominance (2009–2018)

Florentino Pérez was elected as Real Madrid president for the second time on June 1, 2009, following his announcement of candidacy on May 14, 2009, amid the club's failure to win the UEFA Champions League since 2002. Pérez promised a revival through high-profile signings, dubbing it the "second Galácticos era," with initial investments exceeding €250 million in the summer transfer window. Key acquisitions included Cristiano Ronaldo from Manchester United for €94 million on July 11, 2009; Kaká from AC Milan for €67 million; Karim Benzema from Lyon for €35 million; and Xabi Alonso from Liverpool for €30 million.

Under initial coach Manuel Pellegrini, Real Madrid finished as La Liga runners-up in 2009–10 with a club-record 96 points but exited the Champions League in the round of 16 against Lyon, prompting Pérez to appoint José Mourinho on May 28, 2010. Mourinho's tenure emphasized defensive solidity and rivalry dominance, including two record El Clásico wins over Barcelona in 2011 (5–0 aggregate in Copa del Rey semifinals). The team secured the 2010–11 Copa del Rey on April 20, 2011, ending a 18-year drought, and the 2011–12 La Liga title with a record 100 points and 121 goals scored. However, Champions League progress stalled, with quarterfinal exits in 2011, 2012, and 2013, leading to Mourinho's departure in May 2013.

Carlo Ancelotti took over in June 2013, blending experience with youth signings like Toni Kroos (€25 million from Bayern Munich) and James Rodríguez (€75 million from Monaco post-2014 World Cup). The 2013–14 season culminated in Real Madrid's tenth Champions League title, "La Décima," defeating Atlético Madrid 4–1 in the final on May 24, 2014, after extra time, with Sergio Ramos equalizing in the 93rd minute and Gareth Bale scoring the winner. This victory, following a semifinal comeback against Bayern Munich, marked the end of a 12-year European drought and was followed by the 2014 UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup wins. Ancelotti also secured the 2013–14 Copa del Rey on April 16, 2014, achieving a domestic-European double.

After a semifinal Champions League exit in 2014–15, Rafael Benítez was appointed in June 2015 but dismissed in January 2016 amid poor form, with Zinedine Zidane promoted from the reserve team. Zidane's era delivered unprecedented European dominance: the 2015–16 Champions League title (4–3 aggregate semifinal over Manchester City, 1–0 final win over Atlético Madrid on May 28, 2016, via penalties); the 2016–17 title (back-to-back La Liga-Champions League double, defeating Juventus 4–1 in the final on June 3, 2017); and the 2017–18 title (three consecutive wins, beating Liverpool 3–1 in the final on May 26, 2018, despite a first-half own goal and red card). These triumphs, supported by core players like Ronaldo (scoring 44 Champions League goals from 2016–18), Luka Modrić, and a resilient defense, yielded four Champions League titles in five years, alongside two La Liga crowns (2016–17 with 93 points; shared 2017 title on goal difference), two UEFA Super Cups, two Club World Cups, and one more Copa del Rey (2014). Pérez's strategy of financial prudence post-2009, generating revenue through stadium upgrades and global branding, underpinned this revival, transforming Real Madrid into Europe's most decorated club by 2018.

### Sustained success and roster evolution (2018–2025)

Following the resignation of Zinedine Zidane on 31 May 2018, after securing three consecutive UEFA Champions League titles, Real Madrid entered a transitional phase marked by managerial instability and the departure of Cristiano Ronaldo to Juventus on 10 July 2018 for €100 million. The club appointed Julen Lopetegui as manager on 31 May 2018, but his tenure lasted only until 29 October 2018 amid a poor start that included elimination from the Champions League group stage. Santiago Solari served as interim manager until Zidane's return on 11 March 2019, but the 2018–19 season yielded no trophies, with the team finishing third in La Liga.

Zidane's second stint stabilized the squad, culminating in the 2019–20 La Liga title won on 17 July 2020, ending Barcelona's dominance despite a global pandemic disrupting the schedule. Key to this revival was the integration of young talents like Vinícius Júnior, who joined from Flamengo in July 2018 for €45 million and evolved into a pivotal attacker, and Rodrygo, signed from Santos in June 2019 for €50 million. However, high-profile signings such as Eden Hazard from Chelsea in June 2019 for €100 million and Luka Jović from Eintracht Frankfurt for €60 million in July 2019 underperformed due to injuries and adaptation issues, highlighting risks in post-Ronaldo recruitment. Zidane departed again on 31 May 2021 after reaching the Champions League semifinals but failing domestically.

Carlo Ancelotti's return on 1 June 2021 ushered in renewed dominance, with the 2021–22 season delivering La Liga on 30 April 2022 and the Champions League on 28 May 2022 against Liverpool, Benzema's 44 goals earning him the Ballon d'Or. Roster evolution emphasized defensive reinforcements via free transfers—David Alaba from Bayern Munich in 2021 and Antonio Rüdiger from Chelsea in 2022—alongside midfield bolstering with Eduardo Camavinga from Rennes for €31 million in 2021 and Aurélien Tchouaméni from Monaco for €80 million in 2022. The 2022–23 campaign saw setbacks, including a Champions League semifinal exit to Manchester City and second place in La Liga, prompting further youth integration like Fede Valverde's emergence.

The 2023–24 double—La Liga and Champions League (won 1 June 2024 against Borussia Dortmund)—underscored sustained European prowess, with Jude Bellingham's €103 million signing from Borchester in June 2023 providing midfield dynamism (23 goals in his debut season). Kylian Mbappé joined on a free transfer from Paris Saint-Germain in June 2024, forming a potent attack with Vinícius Júnior, though integration challenges arose amid Endrick's €47.5 million arrival from Palmeiras. Departures of veterans like Sergio Ramos (free to PSG in 2021), Raphaël Varane (to Manchester United in 2021), and Casemiro (to Manchester United for €70 million in 2022) shifted reliance to a younger core, reducing average age while maintaining competitiveness.

Ancelotti's contract expired on 1 June 2025, leading to Xabi Alonso's appointment from Bayer Leverkusen, amid a trophyless 2024–25 La Liga campaign won by Barcelona. The 2025 summer window featured defensive additions like Trent Alexander-Arnold (free from Liverpool) and Dean Huijsen from Juventus, alongside exits including Luka Modrić to AC Milan, signaling further evolution toward a post-Benzema (retired 2023) era focused on speed and technical midfield control. This period's success—three La Liga titles and two Champions League triumphs—stemmed from strategic free-agent acquisitions, academy promotions, and managerial adaptability, sustaining Madrid's status despite roster flux.

### Recent transitions and future outlook (2025–present)

In the aftermath of the 2024–25 season, during which Real Madrid secured second place in La Liga with a record of 26 wins, 6 draws, and 6 losses, accumulating 84 points, the club underwent a significant managerial transition by appointing Xabi Alonso as head coach for the 2025–26 campaign, replacing Carlo Ancelotti following the latter's tenure marked by domestic consistency but European shortcomings, including a Champions League quarter-final exit. Alonso, a former Real Madrid midfielder renowned for his tactical acumen demonstrated at Bayer Leverkusen, was tasked with revitalizing the squad amid criticisms of imbalance stemming from Kylian Mbappé's integration, which some analysts attributed to tactical rigidity under Ancelotti and over-reliance on individual brilliance rather than collective structure.

The 2025 summer transfer window reflected a strategic overhaul, with incoming signings including right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold from Liverpool, center-back Dean Huijsen from Juventus, left-back Álvaro Carreras from Benfica, and midfielder Franco Mastantuono from River Plate, aimed at bolstering defensive depth and midfield creativity while injecting youth. Outgoings featured veteran midfielder Luka Modrić, whose departure symbolized a shift toward roster renewal, though core attackers like Mbappé, Vinícius Júnior, and Rodrygo remained central. Alonso's approach emphasized blending these experienced forwards with emerging talents, though young striker Endrick faced limited opportunities, prompting discussions of a potential January loan to facilitate adaptation to the new tactical demands.

Looking ahead, Alonso has signaled flexibility in the market, expressing willingness to offload players except Mbappé to pursue high-profile targets such as Juventus forward Kenan Yıldız for approximately €100 million, underscoring a focus on enhancing attacking versatility without disrupting the French star's role. Early indicators for 2025–26 suggest a squad recalibration toward sustained competitiveness in La Liga and the Champions League, leveraging renovated facilities at the Santiago Bernabéu and the club's financial prowess under president Florentino Pérez, though success hinges on resolving integration challenges for new arrivals and maintaining defensive solidity amid an aging core.

## Club Identity

### Crest evolution

The crest of Real Madrid Club de Fútbol originated in 1902 with the initials "MFC" arranged in a gothic-style monogram, representing Madrid Football Club, set against a simple background without royal insignia. This early design emphasized the club's foundational identity in a blue and white color scheme.

In 1908, the crest was updated to enclose the "MFC" monogram within a circular frame, modernizing the layout while retaining the core initials; the "M" followed the circle's contour, with "F" intersecting "C". This version persisted until 1920, when King Alfonso XIII granted the club the "Real" title, prompting the addition of an ornate crown atop the circle to symbolize royal patronage. The crown, rendered in blue and white, marked the club's elevated status and introduction of monarchical elements.

The 1931 proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic led to the removal of the crown and "Real" designation, as republican policies prohibited monarchical symbols; the crest then incorporated a wide purple diagonal band representing the historic region of Castile, set within the blue circle.  This alteration reflected political constraints during the interwar period and Spanish Civil War.

Following the Spanish Civil War, in 1941, the club reinstated the royal crown—now more detailed in gold and red with simulated gems—and restored the "Real" name, aligning with the Franco regime's emphasis on traditional Spanish symbols; the purple Castile band was retained, and letters gained thicker outlines.  This version endured with minor variations until 1997, when colors shifted: the purple band became blue, the crown adopted a brighter yellow tone, and the frame turned yellow for enhanced visibility.

The current crest, introduced in 2001, features a streamlined flat design with the "M.C.F." initials aligned on a single plane, a shortened blue Castile band, a raised gold crown, and a yellow circular frame outlined in blue; these changes prioritized simplicity and recognizability for global branding.  A brief 2012-2013 iteration tested further minimalism but was not adopted permanently.

### Colours, kits, and sponsorships

Real Madrid's primary kit colour is white, adopted for the home kit upon the club's foundation in 1902 and originating from the founders' admiration for the all-white uniforms of English amateur side Corinthians FC. This has earned the team the moniker *Los Blancos* ("The Whites"), with white shirts, shorts, and socks forming the traditional home ensemble to symbolize purity and distinction.

Away kits have varied to prevent colour clashes, frequently employing darker shades like purple in the 1990s, black in select seasons such as 2014–15, or blue, while third kits—formalized from the late 20th century—often feature experimental patterns, including houndstooth accents or metallic elements in recent designs. For the 2025–26 season, the home kit retains a predominantly white jersey with integrated textures evoking the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium's refurbishment, paired with matching shorts and socks; the away kit shifts to navy blue, and the third incorporates purple influences tied to historical crest motifs.

Adidas has manufactured Real Madrid's kits since 1998, succeeding Kelme (1994–1998), Hummel (1986–1994), and an earlier Adidas stint (1980–1986), with the current deal valued at approximately €117.6 million annually as of 2025. Sponsorships encompass principal shirt partner Fly Emirates, in place since 2011 and featuring prominently on the front of jerseys, alongside kit supplier Adidas; automotive partner BMW; and grooming brand Nivea Men, with additional deals like the three-year agreement with Corpay announced in June 2025 for global payment solutions.

## Stadium and Facilities

### Santiago Bernabéu Stadium history and renovations

The Santiago Bernabéu Stadium was constructed starting in 1944 under the leadership of Real Madrid president Santiago Bernabéu, who envisioned a larger venue to accommodate the club's growing fanbase after the modest Chamartín Stadium proved insufficient. The project utilized the site of the former Chamartín Stadium along with adjacent land from Villa Ulpiana, with the first stone laid on October 28, 1944. It officially opened on December 14, 1947, initially seating approximately 22,500 spectators, though early expansions quickly increased this figure.

In 1952, the first major expansion modernized the arena and raised capacity to 75,000, reflecting the club's rising prominence during its European Cup successes. Further work in 1954–1955 added a third tier, pushing capacity to 125,000 by June 1955 and briefly making it Europe's largest stadium at the time. Floodlights were installed in 1957, enabling the first night match and enhancing its role as a venue for high-profile events. The stadium was renamed in honor of president Bernabéu on January 4, 1955, by unanimous club member vote, acknowledging his pivotal role in its development and the club's revival post-World War II.

Subsequent renovations included preparations for the 1982 FIFA World Cup, which hosted the final match between Italy and West Germany on July 11, 1982, with capacity expanded to 90,800 through structural reinforcements and additional seating. Post-1980s safety regulations in the 1990s converted it to an all-seater configuration, reducing capacity to around 81,044 while adding covered stands and improved facilities like restaurants and a media center. These changes prioritized spectator safety and comfort amid evolving European standards, though they marked a shift from standing terraces that had defined earlier eras.

A comprehensive renovation began in June 2019, aimed at transforming the aging structure into a multifunctional venue while preserving its iconic status. Key additions included a retractable roof and pitch, 360-degree video screens, enhanced acoustics, and upgraded VIP areas, with the project increasing capacity slightly to 83,000. The €1.2 billion initiative, led by architects like those from FCC Construcción, faced delays from the COVID-19 pandemic and supply chain issues but allowed partial reopening for matches in late 2023. By late 2024, core works were substantially complete, with full operational status achieved by summer 2025, enabling non-football events and revenue diversification through concerts and hospitality. This overhaul addressed structural vulnerabilities from decades of use, ensuring compliance with modern seismic and fire codes while boosting the club's commercial viability.

### Training grounds and academy facilities

Real Madrid's primary training complex, Ciudad Real Madrid (commonly referred to as Valdebebas), spans 1,200,000 square meters in the Valdebebas district of northern Madrid and serves as the hub for both the senior team's preparations and youth academy operations. Inaugurated on September 30, 2005, during Florentino Pérez's first presidency, the facility expanded significantly from an earlier, smaller Sports City established in the 1990s, incorporating advanced infrastructure designed to support professional training, player recovery, and talent development. It features 12 full-size football pitches—several with identical dimensions and grass specifications to the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium—along with hydrotherapy pools, a comprehensive medical center, strength and conditioning gyms, audiovisual analysis rooms, and administrative offices.

The complex includes the Alfredo Di Stéfano Stadium, a 6,000-seat venue completed in 2006 and primarily used for Real Madrid Castilla (the reserve team) matches, women's team games, and youth fixtures, with a main western stand capacity of 4,000 and an eastern stand adding 2,000 seats. Additional amenities encompass multiple changing rooms capable of accommodating all La Liga clubs simultaneously, classrooms for tactical education, and a 9,000-square-meter central building housing locker facilities, press areas, and rehabilitation zones. This setup enables integrated operations, allowing senior players like those under Carlo Ancelotti to train alongside academy prospects on adjacent fields, fostering a seamless pathway from youth to first-team integration.

La Fábrica, Real Madrid's renowned youth academy, operates within Valdebebas and emphasizes technical skill development, tactical discipline, and psychological resilience for over 280 players across age groups from under-6 to under-19. Originating in the 1950s under the club's early professionalization efforts, the modern iteration benefits from the 2005 facility's €100 million investment, which positioned it as one of Europe's premier academies by providing specialized pitches, video analysis suites, and educational integration to balance athletic and academic growth. Notable alumni include Iker Casillas, Raúl González, and more recent graduates like Dani Carvajal and Federico Valverde, underscoring its efficacy in producing first-team contributors despite the club's Galácticos strategy prioritizing high-profile signings. The academy's methodology prioritizes ball mastery and competitive exposure, with Castilla competing in the Segunda División B (now Primera Federación) to bridge the gap to elite levels.

## Achievements and Records

### Domestic competitions

Real Madrid has secured a record 36 La Liga titles, the highest in Spanish football history, with the most recent victory in the 2023–24 season.  The club's league dominance spans multiple eras, including five consecutive championships from 1960–61 to 1964–65 under manager Miguel Muñoz and three straight titles from 2016–17 to 2017–18 during Zinedine Zidane's tenure. Notable records include the highest points total in a 38-match season with 100 points achieved in 2011–12, and the club holds the record for most unbeaten matches in a row with 42 from 2016 to 2018.

In the Copa del Rey, Real Madrid has triumphed 20 times, ranking third behind FC Barcelona's 31 and Athletic Bilbao's 24 victories. The first win came in the 1905–06 edition, with significant successes including doubles alongside La Liga in seasons like 1961–62, 1973–74, and 1974–75. The most recent triumph occurred in 2022–23, defeating Osasuna 2–1 in the final, though the club fell short in the 2024–25 final against Barcelona.

Real Madrid has claimed the Supercopa de España 13 times, the second-most after Barcelona's 15, with wins often pitting league and cup champions against each other. The competition, contested annually since 1982 (with interruptions), saw Real Madrid secure four consecutive titles from 1988 to 1990 and again from 2019–20 to 2022, including a 4–1 victory over Barcelona in the 2024 edition before losing the 2025 final 2–5 to the same opponent. Domestically, the club has achieved the La Liga–Copa del Rey double on four occasions, underscoring its sustained excellence in Spain's premier competitions.

### European and international titles

Real Madrid has achieved unparalleled success in European and international competitions, securing 15 UEFA Champions League titles, more than any other club, which underscores its historical dominance in continental football. The club claimed the first five editions of the European Cup between 1956 and 1960, defeating opponents including Reims, Fiorentina, Milan, and Eintracht Frankfurt in the finals, often led by Alfredo Di Stéfano and Ferenc Puskás. Subsequent victories in 1966, 1998, 2000, 2002, 2014, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2022, and 2024 extended this record, with the 2014–2018 run under Zinedine Zidane marking four titles in five years through decisive performances in finals against Atlético Madrid (2014, 2016), Juventus (2017), and Liverpool (2018). The 2022 triumph over Liverpool and 2024 win against Borussia Dortmund at Wembley further solidified this legacy, with aggregate scores reflecting clinical efficiency in knockout stages.

In addition to the Champions League, Real Madrid has won the UEFA Europa League (formerly UEFA Cup) twice, in the 1984–85 and 1985–86 seasons, overcoming Videoton and Köln respectively in two-legged finals. The club holds the record for UEFA Super Cup victories with six, achieved in 2002 (vs Feyenoord), 2014 (vs Sevilla), 2016 (vs Sevilla), 2017 (vs Manchester United), 2022 (vs Eintracht Frankfurt), and 2024 (vs Atalanta), typically following Champions League successes.

On the international stage, Real Madrid has claimed nine world club titles, combining three Intercontinental Cups (1960 vs Peñarol, 1998 vs Vasco da Gama, 2002 vs Olimpia) with five FIFA Club World Cups (2014 vs San Lorenzo, 2016 vs Kashima Antlers, 2017 vs Grêmio, 2018 vs Al-Ain, 2022 vs Al-Hilal) and the inaugural FIFA Intercontinental Cup in 2024 (3–0 vs Pachuca). These victories, often secured in neutral venues like Tokyo, Abu Dhabi, and Doha, highlight the club's global supremacy, with goal tallies in finals demonstrating offensive prowess—such as Vinícius Júnior's contributions in recent editions. FIFA recognizes these as equivalent world championships, affirming Real Madrid's status as the most decorated club internationally.

## Rivalries

### El Clásico with FC Barcelona

El Clásico denotes any football match between Real Madrid Club de Fútbol and Futbol Club Barcelona, representing a longstanding rivalry characterized by intense competition for domestic and international supremacy, as well as cultural and regional distinctions between Castile and Catalonia. The fixture typically occurs twice per La Liga season, with additional encounters in cup competitions, drawing global audiences exceeding 500 million viewers for high-profile games due to the clubs' status as Spain's most decorated teams.

The rivalry's origins trace to the clubs' founding in 1902, with their inaugural competitive meeting on May 13, 1902, ending in a 3–1 victory for Barcelona in the Copa de la Coronación. Regular clashes intensified after La Liga's inception in 1929, evolving from regional pride into a symbol of broader Spanish divides, particularly during Francisco Franco's dictatorship (1939–1975), when Barcelona embodied Catalan autonomy aspirations amid suppression, while Real Madrid, based in the capital, received state favoritism, including the controversial 1953 acquisition of Alfredo Di Stéfano, where FIFA mediation resulted in shared ownership but Barcelona subsequently sold their share to Real Madrid. This era saw politically charged incidents, such as the 1943 Copa del Generalísimo semi-final where Real Madrid defeated Barcelona 11–1 in the second leg (aggregate 11–4), later alleged by some Catalan narratives to involve coercion, though primary evidence points to Barcelona's on-field underperformance rather than proven intimidation. Post-dictatorship, the political overlay has diminished, with both clubs emphasizing sporting merit, though fan discourse occasionally revives regional tensions.

In official competitive matches as of October 2025, Real Madrid holds a narrow lead with 105 victories to Barcelona's 104, alongside 52 draws, across 261 encounters primarily in La Liga (195 matches), Copa del Rey, Supercopa de España, and UEFA competitions. Real Madrid has scored 442 goals to Barcelona's 430 in these fixtures, with the home team winning 97 times overall.

| Competition | Real Madrid Wins | Barcelona Wins | Draws | Total Matches |
|-------------|------------------|----------------|-------|---------------|
| La Liga    | 81               | 84             | 38    | 203           |
| Copa del Rey | 13            | 9              | 5     | 27            |
| Supercopa de España | 7       | 5              | 4     | 16            |
| UEFA Champions League | 3   | 4              | 3     | 10            |
| Other      | 1                | 2              | 2     | 5             |
| **Total**  | **105**          | **104**        | **52**| **261**       |

*Data compiled from competitive matches up to May 2025; minor variations may exist pending official ratification.*

Notable matches underscore the fixture's drama, including Real Madrid's 11–1 rout on June 13, 1943, the largest margin in history; Barcelona's 5–0 league win on November 21, 1974, signaling a shift under Dutch total football influence; and the 6–2 Barcelona triumph on May 2, 2009, pivotal in their treble season under Pep Guardiola. More recently, Barcelona secured multiple victories in the 2024–25 season, including 4–0 and 5–2 league defeats of Real Madrid, contributing to a temporary head-to-head parity push before Real Madrid's historical edge reasserted. El Clásico outcomes have frequently decided La Liga titles, with Real Madrid clinching 14 championships via superior results against Barcelona since 1929, compared to Barcelona's 11. The rivalry's stakes extend to individual accolades, with players like Lionel Messi (26 goals in 45 Clásicos) and Cristiano Ronaldo (18 in 30) defining eras through their duels.

### Madrid Derby with Atlético Madrid

The Madrid Derby, known in Spanish as *El Derbi Madrileño*, pits Real Madrid CF against Club Atlético de Madrid, the two primary professional football clubs representing the Spanish capital. The rivalry traces its roots to the clubs' early histories: Real Madrid was founded in 1902 as Madrid Football Club, while Atlético emerged in 1903 as Athletic Club de Madrid, initially a branch of Bilbao's Athletic Club before gaining independence and renaming itself Atlético Aviación during the Spanish Civil War era. The first official competitive matches occurred in the late 1920s, with their inaugural La Liga encounter on February 17, 1929, ending in a 2–0 victory for Real Madrid at the former Chamartín Stadium.

Historically, the derby reflects socioeconomic contrasts within Madrid, with Real Madrid associated with the city's elite and monarchical traditions—earning the "Real" (royal) prefix from King Alfonso XIII in 1920—while Atlético has been viewed as the club of the working class and industrial suburbs, fostering a narrative of underdog resilience against establishment dominance. This dynamic intensified after the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939), when Atlético's mergers and rebrandings contrasted with Real Madrid's institutional stability, though both clubs endured political pressures under Franco's regime. Real Madrid's post-war ascendancy, fueled by figures like Alfredo Di Stéfano from the 1950s onward, established early superiority, but Atlético claimed notable triumphs, such as their 5–0 league win on November 23, 1947, marking the competition's largest margin until matched by Real Madrid's 5–0 responses in 1959 and 1984.

In head-to-head statistics across all competitive fixtures, Real Madrid maintains a commanding lead, with 123 victories to Atlético's 60 and 58 draws as of late September 2025, following Atlético's 5–2 La Liga win on September 27, 2025, at the Metropolitano Stadium—their highest-scoring derby victory since 1947 and a rare interruption to Real's recent dominance. Within La Liga specifically, Real Madrid holds 91 wins against Atlético's 42 across 177 matches, underscoring the former's historical edge despite Atlético's periodic surges, including under Diego Simeone's tenure since December 2011, which yielded league titles in 2013–14 and 2020–21 that directly challenged Real's supremacy. European clashes have amplified the stakes, notably Real Madrid's 4–1 extra-time triumph in the 2014 UEFA Champions League final and their 1–1 penalty shootout win (5–3) in the 2016 final, both at Lisbon's Estádio da Luz.

The derby's intensity stems from shared city infrastructure and fan overlaps, yet diverges in philosophy: Real Madrid's attacking flair and global commercial prowess versus Atlético's defensive pragmatism and cult of perseverance, as embodied by Simeone's "cholismo" ethos. Memorable recent encounters include Atlético's 1–0 upset in the 2013 Copa del Rey final—avenging Real's league double that season—and Real's 3–0 league rout on November 19, 2016, at the Vicente Calderón. These matches often influence title races, with Real Madrid securing 13 more La Liga crowns than Atlético's 11 overall, though the latter's 2021–22 third-place finish and cup successes highlight closing gaps in competitiveness.

### Historical and European rivals

Real Madrid's most enduring European rivalry is with Bayern Munich, the two clubs having met 28 times in the European Cup and UEFA Champions League, representing the most frequent matchup in the competition's history. Real Madrid holds a narrow advantage with 13 wins to Bayern's 11, alongside 4 draws, across ties spanning from the 1975–76 season to the present. These encounters have often decided progression in knockout stages, with Bayern securing notable victories like the 4–1 aggregate in the 2000–01 quarter-finals and Real Madrid advancing in high-profile semi-finals in 2014 and 2018.

The intensity of this rivalry stems from repeated clashes between two of Europe's most decorated sides, both with over 30 major trophies, and has produced dramatic moments, including physical altercations in the 2001–02 Champions League group stage and disputed decisions such as Cristiano Ronaldo's last-minute penalty in the 2017 semi-final second leg. Further controversy arose in 2018 when Sergio Ramos received a deliberate yellow card, resulting in his suspension for the second leg but allowing tactical flexibility, amid Bayern's complaints over officiating. Bayern's official accounts highlight legendary ties like the 1980–81 quarter-finals, underscoring the mutual respect and competitiveness that define the fixture.

In domestic Spanish football's formative years, prior to the dominance of El Clásico, Real Madrid competed intensely with Athletic Bilbao for national honors, as both clubs vied for early La Liga titles in the 1920s and 1930s, with Athletic securing eight championships to Real's two before the Spanish Civil War. This period laid groundwork for competitive historical encounters, though lacking the geopolitical undertones of later rivalries. Other European opponents, such as Juventus—with whom Real Madrid has contested multiple finals, including victories in 1998 and 2017—have also contributed to the club's continental lore, but none match Bayern's frequency or longevity.

## Fanbase and Supporter Culture

### Membership structure and ultras groups

Real Madrid Club de Fútbol is structured as a member-owned entity, with ownership held collectively by its *socios*, who function as shareholders in a democratic model unique among top European clubs. As of 2024, the club counts approximately 95,000 active socios, each paying an annual fee averaging around €123 to maintain membership. Socios elect the club president every four years via direct vote, with the president requiring endorsement from at least 5% of members to stand; they also participate indirectly in governance through a 2,000-member assembly that approves budgets, strategic plans, and disciplinary measures. Admission as a socio is restricted, typically requiring two existing members to vouch and often involving a waiting list, preserving the closed nature of the ownership base.

Membership confers practical benefits, including priority access to Santiago Bernabéu Stadium tickets at up to 30% discounts for general admission and Champions League matches, free entry to the Bernabéu tour (valued at €35), and 10% reductions on official merchandise and stadium concessions. These perks distinguish socios from the broader Madridista fan program, which offers digital cards and lesser discounts but lacks voting rights or ownership stakes.

Regarding ultras groups, Real Madrid's supporter culture has long featured organized factions, most prominently Ultras Sur, established in 1980 and known for occupying the south stand (Fondo Sur) to generate atmosphere through chants, flags, and tifos. Ultras Sur has been linked to right-wing extremism, including fascist imagery, neo-Nazi elements, and incidents of violence, racism, and intimidation toward other fans, prompting repeated conflicts with club authorities. In response to such issues, including a 2013 assault on a fan and broader hooliganism, president Florentino Pérez initiated a ban on Ultras Sur's organized presence in the stadium in late 2013, reassigning seats to less problematic supporters and dissolving official ties.

The club replaced the group with Grada Fans in 2014, a supervised supporter section emphasizing non-violent animation open to all ages and demographics, explicitly rejecting politics, racism, and intolerance to foster family-friendly engagement. This restructuring, part of Pérez's broader eradication of ultras influence, has sustained crowd energy in the south stand while minimizing disruptions, though informal Ultras Sur activity persists outside official channels and occasionally draws criticism for sporadic returns or external protests.

### Global following and attendance records

Real Madrid CF commands the largest global following among football clubs, with approximately 473 million followers across major social media platforms as of 2025, surpassing rivals such as FC Barcelona (427 million) and Manchester United (233 million). This metric, encompassing platforms like Instagram (178 million followers), Facebook, Twitter/X, and TikTok, serves as a verifiable indicator of international popularity, driven by the club's European successes and high-profile players. Estimates of total worldwide fans exceed 400 million, positioning Real Madrid as the most supported club globally according to multiple analyses.

The Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, Real Madrid's home venue with a post-renovation capacity of 83,186 seats, consistently records among the highest attendances in domestic and European competitions. In the 2024–25 La Liga season, the club averaged 72,692 spectators per home match, representing near-full occupancy and topping Spanish league figures. The highest single-game attendance that season reached 81,044 against Real Sociedad, while historical records include 129,690 fans for a 1956 European Cup match against AC Milan. These figures underscore sustained demand, bolstered by season-ticket sales and the stadium's modernized facilities post-2023 upgrades.

## Ownership, Governance, and Finances

### Socios model and democratic governance

Real Madrid Club de Fútbol is owned and governed by its socios, paying members who collectively hold ownership stakes without individual shares, a structure established at the club's founding on March 6, 1902, and maintained through direct member control rather than corporate shareholding. This model exempts the club from Spain's 1990 sports law mandating conversion to sociedades anónimas deportivas (SAD) for professional teams, allowing Real Madrid—along with FC Barcelona, Athletic Bilbao, and Osasuna—to retain full socio ownership while other La Liga clubs transitioned to shareholder-based entities.

Membership requires an annual fee of €149 for adults and €50 for children under 12, granting benefits such as priority ticket access, discounts on merchandise, and voting rights in presidential elections; as of 2024, the club reported 95,612 socios, with numbers fluctuating due to renewals, resignations, and new admissions limited by capacity. All socios over age 18 with at least 18 months of continuous membership can vote directly in presidential elections, held every four years, where candidates must secure endorsements from at least 2% of eligible voters (around 2,000 signatures) and demonstrate financial guarantees, such as a €300,000 bond to cover potential election costs.

The elected president appoints the board of directors, subject to assembly approval, and holds executive authority over operations, including transfers, stadium management, and strategy, but remains accountable to the General Assembly of Compromisarios—a delegate body of about 2,000 socios elected proportionally from regional sections—who vote on budgets, major investments, and bylaws. This tiered democracy ensures broad participation in leadership selection while concentrating routine governance in representatives, a system that has enabled long tenures, as seen in Florentino Pérez's unopposed re-election on January 19, 2025, for a seventh term extending to 2029.

As of October 2025, the model faces internal debate over potential reforms to permit up to 49% external investment while preserving socio majority control, akin to Bayern Munich's 50+1 rule, driven by Pérez to enhance financial flexibility amid competition from state-backed rivals; any change requires assembly approval and has not yet been implemented. Proponents argue it balances democratic oversight with capital access, though critics within the socio base view it as eroding the club's founding ethos of fan sovereignty.

### Financial performance and revenue sources

Real Madrid CF has consistently ranked among the world's highest-revenue football clubs, driven by its global brand and competitive success. For the 2023/24 season, the club generated €1.073 billion in operating income before asset disposals, becoming the first to exceed €1 billion in a single year according to Deloitte's analysis. In the subsequent 2024/25 financial year, revenue excluding player transfers reached €1.185 billion, a 10% year-over-year increase, reflecting sustained growth amid on-pitch achievements including the UEFA Champions League title. This performance yielded a net profit of €24 million for 2024/25, supported by a healthy balance sheet with no significant debt burdens, enabling investments in infrastructure like the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium renovation.

The club's revenue streams are diversified across commercial activities, matchday income, and broadcasting rights, with commercial sources forming the largest share due to high-value sponsorships and merchandising. In recent seasons, commercial revenue has exceeded €480 million annually, led by deals with Adidas (kit supplier since 1998) and Emirates (stadium naming rights), bolstered by the club's extensive global merchandising network and brand licensing. Matchday revenue, enhanced by the Bernabéu renovations increasing capacity and premium offerings, totaled €280 million in 2024/25, driven by high attendance averaging over 80,000 per home game and hospitality sales. Broadcasting income, derived from La Liga domestic rights and UEFA competitions, contributes significantly, though exact figures fluctuate with performance; combined with matchday, these operational revenues underscore Real Madrid's financial resilience without reliance on owner subsidies.

| Revenue Stream (2024/25, € million, excl. player sales) | Amount | Key Drivers |
|---------------------------------------------------------|--------|-------------|
| Commercial                                              | ~500   | Sponsorships (Adidas, Emirates), merchandising |
| Matchday                                                | 280    | Bernabéu attendance, premium seating |
| Broadcasting and other                                  | ~405   | La Liga/UEFA rights, gate receipts |

Player transfer activities provide supplementary income but are not core to operational revenue; net spending remains controlled, with wages at €509 million for 2024/25 aligning below 50% of turnover, adhering to financial sustainability norms. The socios ownership model, emphasizing self-generated funds over external debt, has contributed to this stability, avoiding the leverage issues seen in state-backed or leveraged clubs.

### Ownership controversies and stability

Real Madrid CF operates under a socios model, where the club is owned collectively by its registered members, known as socios, who elect the president and influence major decisions through assemblies and votes. This structure, established since the club's founding in 1902, has provided institutional stability by preventing external takeovers and aligning governance with fan interests, avoiding the volatility seen in privately owned clubs subject to owner whims or financial distress sales. The model requires presidential candidates to meet stringent criteria, including long-term membership and financial guarantees equivalent to 15% of the club's budget, further ensuring committed leadership.

Financially, this ownership framework has underpinned Real Madrid's resilience, with the club reporting a net profit of €24 million for the 2024/25 fiscal year and net debt of €8 million excluding stadium-related obligations, maintaining spending on player wages below 50% of revenue—a benchmark for sustainability. However, president Florentino Pérez, elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2009 and 2018, has argued that the pure socios system limits access to capital needed to rival clubs backed by sovereign wealth funds or private equity, prompting proposals for reform.

In October 2025, Real Madrid advanced plans for a potential referendum on altering the ownership structure, allowing external investors to acquire up to 49% of shares while socios retain majority control, akin to Germany's 50+1 rule. Pérez, aged 78, first floated this in the club's annual general assembly, citing competitive pressures from oil-funded rivals like Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain, but the move has sparked backlash for threatening 123 years of member sovereignty and potentially prioritizing profit over democratic traditions. Critics, including some socios, view it as a step toward commercialization, while supporters contend it would inject funds for infrastructure like the Santiago Bernabéu renovations without ceding control. Any change requires member approval via vote, underscoring the model's enduring safeguard against unilateral shifts.

Historically, the socios system has weathered presidential transitions without existential threats to ownership, as seen in Pérez's ousting in 2006 amid debt from his "Galácticos" signings—totaling over €200 million—yet the club rebounded under member-elected successors before his return. This democratic mechanism contrasts with scandals in investor-owned clubs, promoting long-term stability despite occasional governance friction, such as heated elections or Pérez's legal disputes over media intrusions into his tenure. Overall, while the proposed reforms test the model's purity, Real Madrid's financial health—bolstered by €1.1 billion in annual revenue from matchdays, broadcasting, and commercial deals—affirms its robustness under current ownership.

## Players and Personnel

### Current first-team squad

As of October 25, 2025, Real Madrid CF's first-team squad for the 2025–26 season features a blend of world-class talents, recent high-profile acquisitions like Trent Alexander-Arnold and Kylian Mbappé, and promising academy graduates, managed by head coach Xabi Alonso.

This composition reflects strategic reinforcements during the summer transfer window, including Alexander-Arnold's arrival from Liverpool on a free transfer and Mbappé's integration as a marquee signing, while veterans like Carvajal and Alaba provide experience amid injuries and rotations. Squad selections for matches may vary due to form, injuries, or tactical needs, as seen in recent UEFA Champions League call-ups.

### Reserve, academy, and youth development

Real Madrid's youth academy, La Fábrica, traces its origins to the 1950s, initiated under club president Santiago Bernabéu as a systematic program to cultivate talent from an early age. The system emphasizes technical proficiency, tactical awareness, and physical conditioning, operating from the Ciudad Real Madrid complex, which includes dedicated training fields and accommodates around 281 players across age groups from under-6 to under-19. Development prioritizes internal progression, with scouts identifying prospects primarily from Spain but increasingly incorporating international talent through partnerships and trials.

The reserve team, Real Madrid Castilla, functions as the bridge between youth ranks and the senior squad, competing in the Primera Federación Group 1, Spain's third-tier league, as of the 2025–26 season. Established in the 1970s as Castiella before adopting its current name, Castilla plays home matches at the Alfredo Di Stéfano Stadium, capacity 6,000, and adheres to rules barring promotion to La Liga to avoid direct competition with the first team. In the 2024–25 season, Castilla finished mid-table, relying heavily on academy graduates amid limited external reinforcements, with standout performances from forwards like Gonzalo García, who set club youth scoring records.

La Fábrica's output has yielded significant returns, generating €445 million from player sales over the past two decades, funding further infrastructure while sustaining a net-positive financial model through strategic transfers. Notable alumni integrated into the first team include defenders Dani Carvajal (debut 2013) and Fran García, midfielder Federico Valverde (joined youth 2016, promoted 2018), and forwards Rodrygo and Vinícius Júnior, though the latter two arrived via external academies before full assimilation. Historical graduates like goalkeeper Iker Casillas (debut 1999) and forward Raúl González (debut 1994) amassed over 1,000 combined appearances, underscoring long-term success in producing Ballon d'Or contenders and national team staples.

Youth teams achieved a record 13 league titles across divisions in the 2024–25 campaign, surpassing the prior benchmark of 12 from 2022–23, with triumphs spanning under-10 to Castilla levels in regional and national competitions. This dominance reflects a philosophy favoring high-possession play and versatility, as endorsed by former academy director Raúl González, who in 2024 described La Fábrica as the world's premier system for talent production. Despite occasional criticism for selling prospects like Álvaro Morata (to Juventus, 2014, €20 million) before full first-team maturity, the model's causal emphasis on scouting volume and rigorous evaluation has sustained Real Madrid's pipeline amid heavy reliance on marquee signings.

### Technical staff and coaching history

The technical staff of Real Madrid CF, as of October 2025, is led by head coach Xabi Alonso, who assumed the role on 1 June 2025 under a three-year contract expiring 30 June 2028. Alonso, a former Real Madrid midfielder who won six trophies with the club as a player, previously managed Bayer Leverkusen to an unbeaten Bundesliga title in 2023–24. His core staff includes assistant coach Sebas Parrilla, physical trainer Ismael Camenforte, performance manager Antonio Pintus, and additional analysts such as Alberto Encinas and Beñat Labaien, forming a seven-member coaching team carried over from Alonso's Leverkusen tenure. 

Real Madrid's coaching history reflects the club's high-performance demands, with over 40 managers since its founding in 1902, marked by frequent changes during periods of underachievement despite vast resources. The most enduring tenure belongs to Miguel Muñoz, who managed from 1959 to 1974, securing 9 La Liga titles, 2 European Cups, and 603 matches in charge, establishing a foundation of tactical discipline and counter-attacking play that prioritized star forwards like Di Stéfano and Puskás. Subsequent eras saw instability, particularly under the Galácticos policy initiated in 2000, where 16 managers cycled through amid trophy droughts, contrasting with more stable successes under Vicente del Bosque (1999–2003), who won 2 UEFA Champions Leagues and 2 La Ligas by leveraging squad depth over individual stardom.

In the modern period, Zinedine Zidane's three stints (2015–2018, 2019–2021) yielded 3 consecutive UEFA Champions Leagues from 2016 to 2018, employing pragmatic rotations and motivational leadership amid player egos. Carlo Ancelotti, across two terms (2013–2015, 2021–2025), amassed 353 matches and multiple titles, including 2 La Ligas and 2 UEFA Champions Leagues, noted for his calm authority in managing high-profile talents like Ronaldo and Benzema, though his 2024–25 exit followed a season of defensive lapses and squad aging.  These appointments underscore a pattern where success correlates with coaches adapting to Real Madrid's attacking ethos and European focus, often at the expense of domestic consistency during transitions.

| Manager          | Tenure              | Key Achievements |
|------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| Miguel Muñoz    | 1959–1974          | 9 La Liga, 2 European Cups |
| Vicente del Bosque | 1999–2003       | 2 La Liga, 2 UEFA Champions Leagues |
| Zinedine Zidane | 2015–2018, 2019–2021 | 3 UEFA Champions Leagues, 2 La Liga |
| Carlo Ancelotti | 2013–2015, 2021–2025 | 2 La Liga, 2 UEFA Champions Leagues  |
| Xabi Alonso     | 2025–present       | Appointed post-Ancelotti |

### Executive management

Florentino Pérez serves as president of Real Madrid CF, having been re-elected unopposed on January 19, 2025, for a four-year term ending in 2029. This marks his fifth consecutive term in the role since returning in 2009, following an initial presidency from 2000 to 2006. As president, Pérez holds ultimate authority over club strategy, including player signings, infrastructure projects like the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium renovation, and financial management, under which Real Madrid has secured 36 major trophies, including six UEFA Champions League titles between 2014 and 2022.

The board of directors, appointed by the president and approved by the club's general assembly of socios (members), comprises approximately 20-25 members responsible for governance, oversight of committees such as economic, purchasing, and compliance, and alignment with the club's democratic structure. Following Pérez's 2025 re-election, the board was renewed with select new appointments to maintain continuity in operations amid ongoing projects like stadium upgrades and youth academy expansions.

Operational leadership falls to José Ángel Sánchez as chief executive officer, a position he has held since 2009 after joining the club in 2000 as director of marketing and sales. Sánchez oversees daily administration, commercial partnerships generating over €1 billion in annual revenue, transfer negotiations, and institutional relations, contributing to Real Madrid's status as the world's most valuable football club per Forbes valuations exceeding €6 billion as of 2024. Other key roles include Santiago Solari as director of professional football, managing scouting and squad development. The executive structure emphasizes Pérez's vision of "galácticos" signings and financial self-sufficiency, with the board ensuring compliance with La Liga's economic controls.

## Controversies and Criticisms

### Political associations during Franco era

During the Franco dictatorship from 1939 to 1975, Real Madrid CF aligned ideologically with the regime's emphasis on Spanish centralism and Castilian identity, contrasting with peripheral clubs like FC Barcelona that represented regional autonomies suppressed by the state. The club's post-Civil War revival under president Santiago Bernabéu, who served from 1943 until his death in 1978, coincided with state facilitation of infrastructure projects, including the donation of public land in 1947 for the expansion of the Estadio Chamartín into a larger venue capable of holding over 100,000 spectators by its 1950s completion; this support, including low-interest loans and bureaucratic expediting, enabled Real Madrid to host major events and symbolize national unity amid international isolation.

The regime leveraged Real Madrid's European successes—five consecutive UEFA Champions League titles from 1956 to 1960—for propaganda, portraying the club as evidence of Spain's resurgence under Franco, with Bernabéu cultivating ties to officials like General Agustín Muñoz Grandes to secure resources and diplomatic leverage, such as in the controversial 1953 signing of Alfredo Di Stéfano, where FIFA mediation by Armando Muñoz Calero resulted in shared ownership on September 15, 1953, but Barcelona's interim board renounced their claim, selling their share to Real Madrid on October 23, 1953. However, claims of Real Madrid as the dictator's personal instrument are overstated, as Franco attended fewer club matches than commonly alleged and provided similar infrastructural aid to Barcelona for Camp Nou construction, including over 50 million pesetas in non-refundable grants acknowledged by the Catalan club in 1971.

Bernabéu's pragmatic opportunism, rather than overt political subservience, drove much of the association; while the club avoided direct Falangist control—maintaining its socios democratic structure unlike some regime-nominated presidencies elsewhere—its dominance reinforced the narrative of Madrid as the regime's sporting emblem, though archival evidence shows Franco's interest was instrumental, backing winners to bolster his image rather than engineering outcomes through systemic corruption. This perception persists partly due to post-dictatorship narratives from regionalist perspectives, which amplify favoritism claims while downplaying comparable state interventions across Spanish football.

### Accusations of refereeing favoritism and corruption

Real Madrid CF has been subject to longstanding accusations from rival clubs, particularly FC Barcelona, of receiving favorable treatment from referees in La Liga and UEFA competitions, often framed as systemic bias or influence stemming from the club's institutional power in Spanish football. These claims intensified during periods of Madrid's dominance, such as their three consecutive UEFA Champions League titles from 2016 to 2018, with former Bayern Munich player Arturo Vidal alleging referee favoritism in knockout matches against his team, citing overlooked fouls on Bayern players in both 2017 and 2018 encounters. Similar assertions surfaced in domestic leagues, where Barcelona president Joan Laporta in 2023 described Madrid as "historically advantaged" by officials amid Barcelona's own referee payment scandal; Real Madrid responded with a video highlighting Barcelona's historical ties to the Franco regime, including subsidies and stadium aid, to counter the claims.

A 2024 UEFA-commissioned study highlighted disparities in Spanish refereeing, finding that officials awarded 18% more penalties to top-three La Liga teams—including Real Madrid—compared to mid-table sides, suggesting potential leniency toward elite clubs based on competitive hierarchy rather than explicit corruption. Analysis of Video Assistant Referee (VAR) interventions further indicated that field referees initially favored Madrid in on-pitch decisions, with VAR overturning 31 Madrid goals disallowed and nine penalties rescinded in their favor during the 2024-25 season, implying pre-VAR calls benefited them disproportionately before corrections. However, no empirical studies or official investigations have substantiated bribery or organized corruption involving Madrid, unlike the 2023 Negreira case against Barcelona, where payments to a refereeing committee vice-president led to bribery probes.

Critics, including Catalan media outlets, have cataloged specific La Liga matches—such as nine instances in the 2023-24 season where disputed calls allegedly tipped outcomes toward Madrid, including overlooked handballs and unpenalized fouls on opponents. These narratives often originate from rival fanbases or outlets with evident partisan leanings, lacking independent corroboration, and Madrid has countered by filing formal complaints against refereeing bodies, such as a February 2025 submission to the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) over VAR audio in matches against Espanyol, citing decisions disadvantaging them. Broader data on red cards shows near parity for Madrid (121 received vs. 119 to opponents since 2000), undermining claims of egregious bias. Ultimately, while perceptual favoritism persists in football discourse, Madrid's 36 La Liga titles and 15 Champions Leagues correlate more robustly with on-field performance metrics than proven malfeasance.

### Fan-related incidents and internal disputes

Real Madrid's Ultras Sur supporter group, established in 1980, has been linked to neo-Nazi symbolism, racist chants, and multiple violent episodes, prompting the club's decision to expel them from the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in December 2013 following assaults on rival fans and internal power struggles. The ban stemmed from incidents including attacks during matches against Barcelona and Valencia, as well as the group's refusal to curb extremist behavior amid growing scrutiny from Spanish authorities. Despite the expulsion, Ultras Sur members resurfaced at away games, such as the 2023 Europa League match against Braga, where their presence led to renewed club investigations into unauthorized attendance and potential violence.

Other fan violence has included clashes with visiting supporters, notably in October 2016 when Legia Warsaw ultras fought Spanish police outside the Bernabéu prior to a Champions League fixture, resulting in arrests and injuries despite Real Madrid's 5-1 victory. In March 2015, following a 2-1 league defeat to Villarreal, approximately 20 fans punched and kicked Gareth Bale's car as the player departed the stadium, an act condemned by the club which identified and banned the perpetrators, including a club member. More recently, in October 2024, Real Madrid launched an investigation into alleged racist insults directed at Barcelona players from sections of the Bernabéu crowd during a league match, reaffirming the club's stance against racism while noting isolated nature of such events amid broader anti-ultra reforms.

Internal divisions within fan groups have also erupted into violence, as seen in September 2024 when a factional split in Ultras Sur culminated in a brawl at their traditional gathering point near the stadium, highlighting ongoing challenges in curbing extremism despite the 2013 ban. Supporters have periodically protested club leadership, with anti-Florentino Pérez banners erected and swiftly removed from the Bernabéu in March 2019 amid a trophyless season and criticisms of management decisions.

Club internal disputes have frequently involved Pérez and players or staff, including reports in April 2025 that squad members conveyed a loss of faith in manager Carlo Ancelotti to the president following tactical shortcomings in key matches. Tensions with Sergio Ramos exemplified longer-term frictions, as Pérez's contract renewal offers were reportedly stalled by the player and his agent in 2021, contributing to Ramos's departure amid perceived ego clashes. In July 2025, emerging disagreements between Pérez and incoming coach Xabi Alonso over strategic visions marked early internal conflict within the technical hierarchy. Pérez has also issued direct warnings to underperforming players like Rodrygo Goes, Ferland Mendy, and Aurélien Tchouaméni in January 2025 for failing to meet expectations, underscoring a pattern of top-down accountability amid high-stakes demands.

## Cultural and Media Impact

### Representation in popular culture

Real Madrid CF has been portrayed in films and documentaries that emphasize its global prestige and dramatic narratives. The 2005 Spanish film *Real: The Movie*, produced with the club's official endorsement, interlaces authentic match footage with five interwoven vignettes—blending factual events and fictional elements—to depict the fervor of supporters and the club's stature as one of the world's wealthiest soccer entities.  In 2023, the miniseries *Real Madrid: Until the End* documented the team's improbable path to the UEFA Champions League title in the 2021–2022 season, featuring player interviews and chronological game analyses to illustrate resilience under pressure. Additional productions, including a 2017 BBC World Service documentary on the club's financial and athletic dominance and a 2025 Netflix feature on a key player with input from figures like Jude Bellingham and Karim Benzema, reinforce Real Madrid's image as a symbol of excellence amid high-stakes competition. 

The club appears extensively in video games, particularly soccer simulations that replicate its roster, tactics, and stadium. Real Madrid is a playable team in annual titles from the EA Sports FC series (previously FIFA) and Konami's eFootball series (formerly Pro Evolution Soccer), enabling users to simulate matches with licensed player likenesses and historical kits dating back to editions like FIFA 98. A dedicated title, *Real Madrid: The Game* (2009) for Wii and Nintendo DS, casts players as aspiring stars progressing from academy levels to first-team glory at the Santiago Bernabéu, emphasizing career-building mechanics unique to the club's structure.

In music, Real Madrid inspires anthems and fan chants that amplify its identity during matches and celebrations. The official hymn "Hala Madrid y Nada Más," composed by RedOne and unveiled in September 2014 after the club's tenth European Cup victory, incorporates orchestral elements and lyrics extolling loyalty, amassing millions of streams and performances at the Bernabéu. Updated versions, such as the 2025 edition, maintain its role in pre-game rituals, while fan-created tracks like "Soy del Madrid" by the folk metal band Mägo de Oz (1994) express devotion through regional pride. High-profile references include American singer Taylor Swift's mention of Real Madrid in her October 2025 single, highlighting the club's crossover appeal beyond sports.

Literature on Real Madrid often frames it as a case study in sustained dominance, with non-fiction works dissecting its operational model. Steven G. Mandis's *The Real Madrid Way* (2016) argues that the club's 32 La Liga titles and 14 Champions League triumphs stem from a values-driven culture prioritizing talent acquisition and fan alignment over short-term gains. Phil Ball's *White Storm: The Story of Real Madrid* (2009) chronicles the club's evolution from 1902 founding through political eras to modern eras, attributing its "galáctico" strategy—recruiting stars like Zinedine Zidane and Cristiano Ronaldo—to a blend of commercial savvy and on-pitch results. These texts, grounded in archival data and interviews, position Real Madrid as an archetype of institutional resilience in professional sports.

### Official media and merchandising

Real Madrid operates Real Madrid TV, an encrypted digital television channel dedicated to club content such as match analyses, player interviews, training footage, and archival material, available via streaming platforms including RM Play.  The channel extends to international markets, with a dedicated streaming service launched in the United States and Canada in July 2021 through a partnership with Cinedigm.

The club's official YouTube channel delivers video highlights, full-match replays, and exclusive documentaries, positioning Real Madrid as one of football's most viewed entities online. Complementing this, the primary website realmadrid.com serves as a hub for news, squad details, fixture schedules, and fan engagement tools. Social media presence includes the verified @realmadriden account on X, used for official announcements and live updates. Hala Madrid, a quarterly print and digital magazine distributed to club members, features in-depth articles on matches, player profiles, and institutional developments, with editions such as the Q1 2025 issue focusing on recent trophies and leadership elections.

Merchandising forms a core revenue stream, bolstered by a long-term kit supply agreement with Adidas that contributes approximately €120 million annually to the club's €260 million in shirt-related sponsorship income for the 2025/26 season.  This deal encompasses jersey production, apparel, and accessories, with Real Madrid leading European clubs in overall merchandising sales estimated at €196 million yearly. Products are retailed through the official online store at shop.realmadrid.com, offering customizable kits, souvenirs, and player-specific items.

Physical outlets include the flagship store at Santiago Bernabéu Stadium's Gate 30, open daily from 10:00 a.m. to 8:30 p.m., which underwent a major renovation in 2024 to create an immersive megastore experience integrating digital displays and club memorabilia.  These channels capitalize on the club's global brand, driving commercial revenue that exceeded $500 million in the most recent reported fiscal year through diversified product lines and international distribution.
