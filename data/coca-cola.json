First introduced in 1886 in Atlanta, Georgia, USA, it has grown to become one of the most iconic and widely consumed beverages in the world. The drink is known for its distinctive sweet flavor, derived from a closely guarded secret formula, and its association with refreshment and happiness through extensive marketing campaigns. Coca-Cola is sold in over 200 countries and territories, making it a symbol of American culture and globalization [Coca-Cola History](https://www.coca-colacompany.com/about-us/history).\n\nBeyond the original cola flavor, The Coca-Cola Company offers a variety of beverages, including Diet Coke, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, and other flavored sodas, as well as non-carbonated drinks like water, juices, and teas. The brand's influence extends into popular culture, advertising, and even environmental and social responsibility discussions.\n\n## Historical Background\n\n### Invention and Early Years\nCoca-Cola was invented by Dr. John Stith Pemberton, a pharmacist in Atlanta, Georgia, on May 8, 1886. Originally marketed as a medicinal tonic, the drink was intended to cure ailments such as headaches and fatigue. Pemberton’s formula included coca leaf extract (a source of cocaine, which was later removed) and kola nut extract (a source of caffeine). The name \"Coca-Cola\" was suggested by Pemberton's bookkeeper, Frank Mason Robinson, who also designed the drink’s iconic cursive logo [World of Coca-Cola](https://www.worldofcoca-cola.com/about-us/coca-cola-history/).\n\nInitially sold at soda fountains for five cents per glass, Coca-Cola gained popularity through word-of-mouth. In 1888, businessman Asa Griggs Candler acquired the rights to the formula and began aggressive marketing, distributing coupons for free samples and advertising the drink as a refreshing beverage rather than a medicine. By 1895, Coca-Cola was being sold in every state in the U.S. [Candler’s Impact](https://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/business-economy/asa-griggs-candler-1851-1929/).\n\n### Bottling and Global Expansion\nThe introduction of bottling in 1899 revolutionized Coca-Cola’s distribution. Joseph Biedenharn, a candy store owner in Mississippi, became the first to bottle the drink, making it portable and accessible beyond soda fountains. In 1916, the distinctive contoured glass bottle, designed to be recognizable even in the dark, was introduced, further solidifying the brand’s identity [Bottle History](https://www.coca-colacompany.com/news/iconic-coca-cola-bottle).\n\nDuring World War II, Coca-Cola became a symbol of American patriotism. The company supplied the drink to U.S. soldiers overseas at a low cost, with the slogan “Coke = morale.” This effort not only boosted brand loyalty but also introduced Coca-Cola to new international markets. Post-war, the company expanded aggressively, establishing bottling plants worldwide [WWII Impact](https://www.nationalww2museum.org/war/articles/coca-cola-wartime).\n\n### Evolution of the Formula\nIn 1985, The Coca-Cola Company made a controversial decision to reformulate the drink, introducing \"New Coke\" in response to competition from Pepsi. The change was met with widespread backlash from consumers, leading to the return of the original formula as \"Coca-Cola Classic\" within three months. This incident, often referred to as the \"Cola Wars,\" highlighted the deep emotional connection consumers had with the original taste [New Coke Fiasco](https://www.history.com/news/new-coke-failure-lessons).\n\n## Current Status and Relevance\n\nToday, Coca-Cola remains a dominant force in the global beverage industry. The Coca-Cola Company, headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, reported revenues of over $43 billion in 2022 and operates in nearly every country worldwide [Coca-Cola Financials](https://investors.coca-colacompany.com/financial-information/financial-results). The brand consistently ranks among the most valuable in the world, valued at approximately $98 billion in 2023 according to Interbrand [Interbrand Ranking](https://www.interbrand.com/best-global-brands/).\n\nCoca-Cola has diversified its portfolio to adapt to changing consumer preferences, offering low-sugar and zero-calorie options like Diet Coke (introduced in 1982) and Coca-Cola Zero Sugar. The company has also expanded into non-carbonated beverages, acquiring brands like Minute Maid, Dasani, and Honest Tea [Product Portfolio](https://www.coca-colacompany.com/brands).\n\nHowever, Coca-Cola faces challenges, including public health concerns over sugar consumption and obesity, as well as environmental criticism regarding plastic waste and water usage in production. The company has pledged to address these issues through initiatives like \"World Without Waste,\" aiming to recycle a bottle or can for every one sold by 2030 [Sustainability Goals](https://www.coca-colacompany.com/sustainability/resource-center/world-without-waste).\n\n## Notable Facts and Details\n\n- **Secret Formula**: The exact recipe for Coca-Cola is a trade secret, reportedly kept in a vault at the World of Coca-Cola museum in Atlanta.
