  "content": "# Emma Stone\n\nEmily Jean Stone (born November 6, 1988), known professionally as Emma Stone, is an American actress and film producer recognized for her versatile performances spanning comedy, drama, and musical genres. She first gained widespread attention with supporting roles in teen comedies like *Superbad* (2007) and her breakout lead in *Easy A* (2010), which showcased her comedic timing and established her as a rising star in Hollywood. Stone transitioned to more dramatic fare, earning an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress for *Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)* (2014) and achieving major acclaim for her singing and dancing in the romantic musical *La La Land* (2016), for which she won the Academy Award for Best Actress. Her second Best Actress Oscar came for portraying the unconventional Bella Baxter in *Poor Things* (2023), directed by Yorgos Lanthimos, highlighting her range in portraying complex, transformative characters. In addition to acting, Stone co-founded the production company Fruit Tree in 2020, focusing on independent films, and has collaborated frequently with Lanthimos on projects like *The Favourite* (2018) and *Kinds of Kindness* (2024). \n\n## Early life\n\n### Family background and childhood\n\nEmily Jean Stone was born on November 6, 1988, in Scottsdale, Arizona, to Krista Jean Stone (née Yeager), a homemaker, and Jeffrey Charles Stone, founder and CEO of a general contracting company. The family maintained financial stability through her father's business, which provided early exposure to operational aspects of construction and contracting without connections to the entertainment sector. Stone has one younger brother, Spencer.\n\nRaised in the affluent suburban environment of Scottsdale, Stone exhibited childhood interests in theater and performing impressions, often drawing from studying shows like *Saturday Night Live*. She faced health challenges including a diagnosis of anxiety—with her first panic attack occurring at age seven—and asthma, which contributed to developing self-reliance and leveraging humor as personal coping strategies.\n\n### Entry into performing arts\n\nStone began her involvement in performing arts through local theater in Arizona, training at the Valley Youth Theatre in Phoenix where she performed in productions including *Titanic*, *Alice in Wonderland*, *Cinderella*, and *The Wiz* between 2000 and 2003.  At age 11, she received her first dramatic role under the guidance of artistic director Bobb Cooper. She also participated in improv activities and school plays during her childhood in Scottsdale.\n\nAt age 15, Stone dropped out of Xavier College Preparatory, an all-girls Catholic high school, after one semester to pursue acting full-time. She convinced her parents with a PowerPoint presentation outlining her career ambitions, leading to an agreement for homeschooling via online classes while relocating. In January 2004, she moved to Los Angeles with her mother to an apartment, marking a self-initiated entry into professional pursuits without familial industry ties, in contrast to common Hollywood pathways reliant on nepotism. \n\nUpon arrival, Stone faced initial hurdles including frequent audition rejections for commercials and other entry-level opportunities. An Arizona acting coach leveraged old Hollywood connections to arrange agent auditions, where she secured representation after delivering monologues. Due to Screen Actors Guild registry conflicts with her birth name Emily Jean Stone already in use, she briefly adopted the stage name Riley Stone for six months before settling on Emma Stone, inspired partly by Emma Bunton of the Spice Girls. \n\n## Career\n\n### Initial television and film roles (2004–2009)\n\nStone made her professional acting debut at age 15 on the VH1 reality competition series *In Search of the New Partridge Family* in 2004, where she won the role of Laurie Partridge, leading to an unsold pilot episode produced as *The New Partridge Family* in 2005. She subsequently secured guest appearances on television, including an episode of *Medium* in 2005 and roles in *Lucky Louie* and *Malcolm in the Middle* in 2006.\n\nTransitioning to film, Stone's feature debut was as Jules in the teen comedy *Superbad* (2007), directed by Greg Mottola, where she portrayed a high school party guest pursued by the protagonists; the low-budget production, made for $20 million, grossed $121.5 million domestically and $170 million worldwide, demonstrating strong appeal to adolescent audiences through its raunchy humor and relatable coming-of-age dynamics. This role marked her entry into comedic features targeting youth demographics, distinct from her prior television work.\n\nShe continued in similar genre fare with supporting parts, including Amelia in the rock band comedy *The Rocker* (2008) and Natalie, a socially awkward sorority pledge, in *The House Bunny* (2008), a Playboy-themed ensemble film emphasizing physical comedy and light satire of college life. In 2009, Stone appeared as Abby in the independent drama *Paper Man*, playing a teenage girl who befriends a struggling writer portrayed by Jeff Daniels, showcasing an early shift toward more introspective character work amid limited commercial exposure. These roles established her in modestly budgeted, teen-oriented projects, building visibility without immediate mainstream dominance.\n\n### Breakthrough in comedy and drama (2010–2013)\n\nIn 2010, Stone starred as Olive Penderghast in the teen comedy *Easy A*, a high school student who pretends to lose her virginity to boost her social standing, drawing comparisons to *The Scarlet Letter*. Her performance in the film, directed by Will Gluck, marked her first leading role in a wide-release feature and showcased her comedic timing through Olive's sarcastic narration and self-aware schemes. For this role, Stone won the MTV Movie Award for Best Comedic Performance in 2011.\n\nThe following year, Stone expanded into romantic comedy with *Crazy, Stupid, Love* (2011), playing Hannah, a law student who sparks a connection with a playboy character portrayed by Ryan Gosling, amid an ensemble exploring marital and generational relationships. Directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, the film highlighted Stone's ability to blend wit and vulnerability in romantic leads. Concurrently, she transitioned to drama as Eugenia \"Skeeter\" Phelan in *The Help* (2011), a young aspiring journalist in 1960s Mississippi who interviews Black domestic workers about their experiences with white employers. In this ensemble piece directed by Tate Taylor, Stone's Skeeter navigates social tensions and personal growth while compiling the maids' stories into a book, demonstrating her range in handling period settings and interpersonal conflicts.\n\nStone's versatility continued in 2012 with the superhero film *The Amazing Spider-Man*, where she portrayed Gwen Stacy, the intelligent girlfriend of Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield), in the reboot directed by Marc Webb. The movie grossed $758 million worldwide, establishing Stone as a draw in action-romance hybrids. She and Garfield began dating during production in late 2011, a relationship that lasted until 2015. In 2013, Stone provided the voice of the adventurous teenager Eep Crood in the animated family film *The Croods*, directed by Kirk DeMicco and Chris Sanders, voicing a cavegirl challenging her overprotective father in a prehistoric world. These roles across comedy, drama, romance, action, and animation underscored Stone's avoidance of typecasting, leveraging her relatable, quick-witted persona to appeal broadly while tackling diverse character arcs.\n\n### Commercial blockbusters and Oscar recognition (2014–2017)\n\nStone reprised her role as Gwen Stacy, Peter Parker's girlfriend, in *The Amazing Spider-Man 2* (2014), directed by Marc Webb, which earned $202.8 million domestically and $708.9 million worldwide despite mixed critical reception. The film's commercial success underscored Stone's draw in franchise blockbusters, building on the $758 million gross of the 2012 predecessor.\n\nThat year, Stone also earned her first Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress for her role as Sam Thomson, the estranged daughter of a faded actor, in Alejandro G. Iñárritu's *Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)* (2014), a satirical drama that won four Oscars including Best Picture.\n\nIn 2016, Stone starred as aspiring actress Mia Dolan opposite Ryan Gosling in Damien Chazelle's musical *La La Land*, which grossed $151.1 million domestically and $509 million worldwide on a $30 million budget. Despite her background lacking extensive musical theater training, Stone prepared through vocal and dance lessons, performing key scenes like \"Audition (The Fools Who Dream)\" live on set, a feat validated by her Academy Award win for Best Actress at the 89th ceremony on February 26, 2017.\n\nStone closed the period portraying tennis pioneer Billie Jean King in *Battle of the Sexes* (2017), directed by Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, earning acclaim for capturing King's determination amid the 1973 match against Bobby Riggs, though the film did not achieve blockbuster status.\n\n### Auteur-driven projects and producer role (2018–present)\n\nFollowing her mainstream successes, Stone shifted toward auteur-driven cinema, prioritizing collaborations with distinctive directors over conventional commercial vehicles. Her partnership with Greek filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos began with *The Favourite* (2018), where she portrayed ambitious courtier Abigail Masham in a period black comedy that earned critical praise for its sharp wit and power dynamics. This marked the first of multiple projects blending Stone's comedic timing with Lanthimos's surreal, boundary-pushing style, yielding films that favor thematic depth and stylistic innovation.\n\nThe collaboration peaked with *Poor Things* (2023), in which Stone starred as Bella Baxter, a revived woman discovering autonomy in a fantastical Victorian world. Her transformative performance garnered widespread acclaim, securing her second Academy Award for Best Actress on March 10, 2024, alongside a Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy. This win highlighted a pattern where Stone's embrace of unconventional, physically and emotionally demanding roles aligned with peak critical validation, contrasting the industry's contemporaneous reliance on franchise-driven blockbusters amid declining theatrical risks. Subsequent Lanthimos works, including anthology *Kinds of Kindness* (2024), further exemplified this trajectory, with Stone contributing to ensemble narratives exploring human absurdity.\n\nAs a producer, Stone co-founded Fruit Tree with husband Dave McCary, focusing on bold, genre-blending content. The banner backed *The Curse* (2023), a Showtime miniseries satirizing home renovation and influencer culture, in which Stone also starred as Whitney Siegel, a performative do-gooder unraveling under scrutiny. Fruit Tree extended to reprising her *Zombieland* character in the sequel *Double Tap* (2019), blending horror-comedy with production oversight to sustain franchise elements while venturing into edgier territory.\n\nStone's latest Lanthimos outing, *Bugonia* (2025), released in limited theaters on October 24, casts her as a corporate CEO suspected of extraterrestrial origins by conspiracy theorists, featuring a bald-headed portrayal achieved without prosthetic injuries for authenticity. Early reception positions it as Certified Fresh at 90% on Rotten Tomatoes, underscoring sustained artistic risk-taking amid Hollywood's blockbuster caution. This phase reflects a causal link between Stone's selective project choices—favoring narrative provocation over broad appeal—and elevated prestige metrics, evidenced by repeated awards contention and festival buzz.\n\n## Acting approach and versatility\n\n### Technique and influences\n\nStone characterizes her acting process as intuitive and present-focused, describing it as a meditative practice that demands complete immersion in the immediate moment rather than premeditated emotional recall or extended character immersion. This approach eschews traditional method acting, prioritizing instinctive responses and natural delivery drawn from personal observation of human behavior over structured technique. She has opted against formal drama school training, instead honing her craft through early classes emphasizing emotional memory and on-set experience, which fosters adaptability and emotional authenticity above technical precision.\n\nHer influences include comedic pioneers Lucille Ball and Diane Keaton, whose timing and physical expressiveness inform Stone's own emphasis on bodily movement, vocal modulation, and spontaneous humor. Stone credits these figures with shaping her rejection of overly rationalized performance in favor of visceral, instinct-driven choices that capture underlying emotional realities.\n\nStone integrates her longstanding experiences with anxiety into her performative toolkit, viewing it not as a hindrance but as a propulsive energy that heightens authenticity and presence, akin to a form of controlled intensity that propels intuitive decision-making on set. This personal element underscores her commitment to roles grounded in raw emotional truth, enabling rapid adjustments without reliance on exhaustive preparatory rituals.\n\n### Range across genres\n\nEmma Stone's filmography encompasses more than 25 feature films across diverse genres, including comedy, horror-comedy, musical, drama, superhero action, animation, and science fiction, reflecting a pattern of deliberate genre exploration. Her initial television appearances in sitcoms like *Lucky Louie* (2006) and procedural dramas such as *Medium* (2005) provided foundational exposure to improvisational and narrative variability, enabling transitions without the typecasting that constrained peers reliant on singular archetypes. This early breadth facilitated subsequent pivots, as seen in the zombie horror-comedy *Zombieland* (2009), where she portrayed the resourceful Wichita amid survival scenarios blending gore and humor.\n\nIn musicals, Stone starred as Mia in *La La Land* (2016), embodying an aspiring actress through song-and-dance sequences that integrated romance with period homage to Hollywood classics. Her voice work in the animated adventure *The Croods* (2013) as the rebellious daughter Eep demonstrated proficiency in family-oriented fantasy, contributing to a global box office exceeding $580 million. More recently, roles in period black comedies like *Poor Things* (2023) as the resurrected Bella Baxter, navigating Victorian-era absurdity with elements of sci-fi reanimation, underscore sustained genre fusion.\n\nScience fiction entries include the upcoming *Bugonia* (2025), a dark comedy-thriller where Stone plays CEO Michelle Fuller, suspected of extraterrestrial origins in a conspiracy-driven kidnapping plot. Repeated collaborations with director Yorgos Lanthimos across such projects—spanning *Poor Things* to *Bugonia*—exemplify her affinity for auteur works that defy conventional categorization, mixing satire, psychological tension, and speculative elements. This distribution of roles across low-budget indies and high-grossing spectacles empirically refutes notions of restricted range, as her selections prioritize narrative innovation over repetitive commercial formulas.\n\n## Reception and impact\n\n### Critical acclaim and major awards\n\nEmma Stone has received widespread critical acclaim, evidenced by two Academy Awards for Best Actress, for her performances as Mia Dolan in *La La Land* (2016) and Bella Baxter in *Poor Things* (2023). She earned additional Oscar nominations for Best Supporting Actress for her roles in *Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)* (2014) and *The Favourite* (2018), totaling four nominations across both leading and supporting categories. These achievements underscore her versatility, with wins spanning musical drama and surreal comedy genres.\n\nStone has also secured two Golden Globe Awards for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy, for *La La Land* in 2017 and *Poor Things* in 2024. Complementing these, she won two British Academy Film Awards (BAFTAs) for Leading Actress, for *La La Land* in 2017 and *Poor Things* in 2024. Her accolades extend to multiple wins from the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) Awards, Critics' Choice Awards, and MTV Movie \\u0026 TV Awards, including a Best Actress nomination for *Bugonia* at the 31st Annual Critics' Choice Awards, including SAG ensembles for *Birdman* and *La La Land*.\n\n| Award | Wins | Nominations | Notable Wins |\n|-------|------|-------------|--------------|\n| Academy Awards | 2 | 4 | Best Actress: *La La Land* (2017), *Poor Things* (2024) |\n| Golden Globe Awards | 2 | 5+ | Best Actress – Musical/Comedy: *La La Land* (2017), *Poor Things* (2024) |\n| BAFTA Awards | 2 | 3+ | Leading Actress: *La La Land* (2017), *Poor Things* (2024) |\n| Critics' Choice Awards | 5 | 11+ | Multiple Best Actress and ensemble wins across films like *La La Land* and *Poor Things* |\n\nIn total, Stone has amassed over 100 wins and more than 250 nominations from various awards bodies, reflecting sustained peer recognition. Her 2017 Oscar win correlated with elevated industry status, as Forbes ranked her the world's highest-paid actress that year with $26 million in pretax earnings, primarily from *La La Land* backend deals, enabling selective pursuit of auteur-driven roles thereafter. While some observers debated potential \"snubs\" for earlier franchise work like *The Amazing Spider-Man* (2012), her factual major award haul prioritizes empirical successes in critically favored independent and prestige films over commercial blockbusters.\n### Commercial performance and box office analysis\n\nFilms starring Emma Stone as a lead or prominent supporting actress have collectively grossed over $4 billion worldwide, with her highest earners driven by franchise entries and select musicals rather than consistent output across genres. Her involvement in *The Amazing Spider-Man* (2012), which earned $758 million globally against a $230 million budget, marked her entry into blockbuster territory, benefiting from the established superhero appeal but yielding moderate returns after marketing costs. The sequel, *The Amazing Spider-Man 2* (2014), followed with $709 million worldwide on a $255 million budget, though it underperformed relative to expectations, contributing to Sony's pivot away from the series.\n\n*La La Land* (2016) stands as a standout non-franchise success, grossing $448 million worldwide on a $30 million budget for a return exceeding 14 times production costs, propelled by awards buzz and musical revival interest despite limited international appeal for the genre. Earlier comedies like *Easy A* (2010) demonstrated strong ROI, earning $102 million globally on a $8 million budget, aligning with her origins in high-margin youth-oriented films that prioritized domestic audiences. In contrast, recent auteur collaborations show variability; *Poor Things* (2023) achieved $117 million worldwide on $35 million, succeeding relative to its scale through critical momentum but falling short of franchise benchmarks.\n\nNotable underperformers highlight risks in ensemble or supporting roles outside her core draw. *Madame Web* (2024), where Stone appeared briefly, grossed $100 million worldwide against an $80 million budget, resulting in substantial losses after factoring marketing, exacerbated by poor reviews and superhero fatigue. *Battle of the Sexes* (2017) earned $13 million domestically on $25 million, failing to capitalize on biographical appeal amid crowded release slates.\n\nEmma Stone's producer credits, such as on *Poor Things*, have included backend participation enhancing personal earnings beyond upfront pay, though industry data indicates her comedies historically deliver higher multipliers (often 5-10x budgets) compared to dramas (2-4x), underscoring a tension between artistic selectivity and commercial reliability in an era favoring franchises over originals. Her career trajectory reflects selective project choices prioritizing director alignment over guaranteed yields, yielding peaks in tentpoles but exposing vulnerabilities in non-IP ventures.\n\n### Criticisms of select performances\n\nIn the 2015 film *Aloha*, directed by Cameron Crowe, Emma Stone portrayed Allison Ng, a character described as one-quarter Hawaiian and one-quarter Chinese, prompting widespread criticism for whitewashing due to Stone's lack of such heritage.  Reviewers and commentators argued that this casting undermined the film's authenticity and Stone's suitability for the role, contributing to perceptions of her performance as miscast and unconvincing amid the Hawaiian setting.  The movie received a 20% approval rating from critics on Rotten Tomatoes, with detractors highlighting how Stone's portrayal failed to embody the ethnic nuances required, exacerbating the film's overall narrative incoherence.\n\nStone's role as Bella Baxter in *Poor Things* (2023), directed by Yorgos Lanthimos, drew accusations of promoting exploitative or faux-feminism through its depiction of a woman's sexual awakening, with critics labeling it voyeuristic and reliant on the male gaze despite claims of empowerment.  Some analyses contended that the film's narrative, co-produced by Stone, prioritized male-directed fantasy over substantive female agency, portraying her character as an exhibitionist figure in scenes interpreted as objectifying rather than liberating.  Stone responded to such critiques by asserting that viewers' judgments often stem from modern social media consumption patterns rather than the film's intent, defending the performance as non-exploitative. \n\nReception of Stone's performances shows variance across projects, with *La La Land* (2016) earning a 91% critics' score on Rotten Tomatoes for her Mia Dolan role, contrasted by more mixed responses to *Battle of the Sexes* (2017) at 84%, where her Billie Jean King was seen by some as prioritizing progressive messaging over historical depth.  Detractors have argued that Stone's frequent reliance on charm and likability in comedic or dramatic turns can mask shallower emotional range, particularly in roles aligning with Hollywood's favored narratives, leading to divides between critic praise and broader audience skepticism. Such acclaim, including Oscar wins, has been critiqued as reflective of industry insularity, where insider preferences amplify certain performances while undervaluing empirical inconsistencies in universal appeal.\n\n## Personal life\n\n### Romantic relationships prior to marriage\n\nEmma Stone dated actor Kieran Culkin from 2010 to 2011, after co-starring together in the 2009 independent film *Paper Man*.  Their relationship received limited media attention, consistent with Stone's preference for privacy in personal matters.\n\nFollowing the end of that relationship, Stone began dating Andrew Garfield in late 2011, having met on the set of *The Amazing Spider-Man* in 2010.  The couple, who portrayed onscreen love interests as Gwen Stacy and Peter Parker, were publicly spotted together at events and outings through 2015, when they amicably parted ways.  No children resulted from these relationships, and Stone has generally avoided extensive tabloid exposure compared to many contemporaries, emphasizing discretion.\n\n### Family life and privacy concerns\n\nEmma Stone married writer and director Dave McCary in September 2020, following their engagement announced in December 2019. The couple, who met during Stone's hosting stint on *Saturday Night Live* in December 2016, have maintained a low public profile regarding their relationship.\n\nStone and McCary welcomed their first child, daughter Louise Jean McCary, on March 13, 2021, in the Los Angeles area. The name Louise honors McCary's grandmother, while Jean is Stone's middle name. Stone has shared minimal details about parenthood, emphasizing in a 2025 interview her efforts to instill respect and global awareness in her daughter while shielding family life from media scrutiny.\n\nStone has voiced discomfort with paparazzi intrusion, describing it as \"uncomfortable\" outside her home and expressing paranoia over potential embarrassing captures during her earlier career. In response to concerns over child privacy, she backed New York legislation in 2023 making unauthorized recording of children in public a misdemeanor, punishable by up to a year in jail, amid debates over First Amendment implications and youth incarceration risks. The family resides privately, with Stone prioritizing work-life balance and limiting public family appearances.\n\n## Philanthropy\n\n### Support for health and cancer initiatives\n\nEmma Stone's engagement in health and cancer initiatives was motivated by her mother Krista Stone's 2008 diagnosis with triple-negative breast cancer, an aggressive form of the disease, when Stone was 19 years old. This personal experience prompted Stone to prioritize support for cancer research and patient services, emphasizing isolation during treatment in public statements.\n\nStone participated multiple times in the Entertainment Industry Foundation's Revlon Run/Walk for Women, which funds cancer research, counseling, and outreach programs for women's cancers. She attended the 15th annual event in New York City's Times Square on May 5, 2012, and joined the 17th annual Run/Walk on May 3, 2014, where she co-hosted with Andy Cohen to promote awareness and fundraising. In a 2012 promotional video for the event, Stone highlighted her mother's survivorship as inspiration for her involvement.\n\nFor broader cancer research efforts, Stone contributed to Stand Up to Cancer (SU2C) campaigns, including a 2011 Lucasfilm benefit video reenacting a *Star Wars* scene to urge donations for translational research. She also appeared in SU2C's third annual televised fundraising special on September 7, alongside celebrities like Taylor Swift and Jessica Biel, to amplify support for multidisciplinary cancer studies. Additionally, Stone supported the Worldwide Orphans Foundation, attending its seventh annual benefit gala on November 14, 2011, at Cipriani Wall Street in New York; the organization delivers health care, mentoring, and education to orphaned children globally. In 2012, she and Andrew Garfield displayed promotional signs for the foundation during paparazzi encounters to direct public attention toward its programs.\n\n### Involvement in broader social causes\n\nStone demonstrated support for the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) by wearing a blue ribbon signifying ACLU backing during the 89th Academy Awards ceremony on February 26, 2017, and at the subsequent Vanity Fair Oscars after-party. This gesture aligned with broader celebrity efforts to signal civil liberties advocacy amid policy debates, though the ACLU's operational focus has drawn scrutiny for selective litigation priorities favoring certain ideological causes over others.\n\nIn mental health advocacy, Stone joined the board of directors of the Child Mind Institute in January 2019, an organization dedicated to research, education, and stigma reduction around pediatric mental disorders, including anxiety, which she has publicly discussed experiencing from a young age. Her involvement has included promoting awareness campaigns, contributing to efforts that emphasize evidence-based interventions over anecdotal narratives. The institute reports funding clinical programs and policy initiatives, with transparency in donor allocations available via public financials, though celebrity board roles often prioritize visibility over direct fiscal oversight.\n\nStone collaborated with Paul McCartney on the \"Who Cares? I Do\" anti-bullying initiative, launched around 2015 by Creative Visions Foundation, featuring a short musical film addressing peer intervention and empathy to counter bullying behaviors. This campaign targeted youth empowerment through creative media, with Stone's participation highlighting personal vulnerability to anxiety as a deterrent to bullying, though empirical evaluations of such celebrity-led efforts show mixed outcomes in measurable reductions of incidence rates, often limited by reliance on awareness rather than scalable interventions.\n\nShe has also backed education-focused efforts for vulnerable children, including the Worldwide Orphans Foundation (now part of Abbott Fund initiatives), which delivers mentoring and schooling programs in regions affected by HIV/AIDS; in June 2014, Stone and Andrew Garfield used paparazzi encounters to direct attention and donations toward the group via signage promoting its work. These activities underscore targeted support for developmental rights, with the foundation reporting aid to thousands of orphans annually, yet celebrity endorsements frequently amplify short-term pledges without guaranteed long-term efficacy tracking.\n\n## Political engagement\n\n### Endorsements and public reactions to elections\n\nIn the 2016 United States presidential election, Emma Stone publicly supported Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton by wearing a pin emblazoned with Clinton's name at the Middleburg Film Festival on October 24, 2016. Following Donald Trump's victory on November 8, 2016, Stone expressed distress in an interview at the Governors Awards on November 14, stating to CNN that the result was \"incredibly difficult to process\" and urging people to \"speak out\" and \"be brave\" in response. This reaction aligned with a broader pattern among Hollywood figures, though empirical analyses of voter data indicate that celebrity endorsements and statements exert negligible causal influence on election outcomes, primarily reinforcing existing partisan preferences rather than swaying undecided voters.\n\nAt the 89th Academy Awards on February 26, 2017, Stone wore a small gold Planned Parenthood pin on her Givenchy gown while accepting the Best Actress award for *La La Land*, signaling continued opposition to the incoming Trump administration's policies on reproductive rights amid threats to federal funding for the organization. Earlier that year, on April 18, 2016, California voter records mistakenly listed Stone as registered with the American Independent Party—a minor conservative party historically linked to segregationist George Wallace—due to a widespread error in Department of Motor Vehicles forms where \"independent\" selections defaulted to the party; Stone, like other affected celebrities with Democratic leanings, corrected her registration to unaffiliated or Democratic.\n\nStone did not issue public endorsements for Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election or for Kamala Harris in 2024, despite widespread celebrity involvement in those cycles; records of campaign supporter lists and media reports omit her from notable backers. Her limited electoral engagement post-2016 reflects a pattern where high-profile actors' public stances often amplify media narratives but lack verifiable impact on turnout or margins, as corroborated by post-election studies emphasizing structural factors like economic conditions and turnout demographics over individual celebrity input.\n\n### Alignment with progressive organizations\n\nEmma Stone has publicly supported Planned Parenthood, a nonprofit organization providing reproductive health services including abortions, by wearing its logo pin on her gown at the 89th Academy Awards on February 26, 2017. This gesture aligned her with the group's advocacy for access to abortion and contraception amid debates over its receipt of approximately $600 million in annual federal funding, which critics argue indirectly subsidizes elective abortions despite federal restrictions on using such funds for the procedure itself.\n\nIn early 2018, Stone endorsed the Time's Up initiative, a Hollywood-backed campaign launched by over 300 women in the entertainment industry to combat workplace sexual harassment through a $13 million legal defense fund for lower-wage workers outside the sector. Her involvement, including support for related #MeToo efforts emphasizing victim solidarity without mandating public disclosure, reflected alignment with social justice responses to industry scandals but drew scrutiny for focusing predominantly on high-profile cases while empirical data shows workplace harassment affects broader demographics, including men and non-entertainment sectors, with varying enforcement outcomes.\n\nStone has also contributed to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), a civil liberties organization often aligned with progressive causes such as defending abortion rights and challenging restrictions on them, through charitable donations and awareness efforts. In September 2025, she signed a pledge organized by Film Workers for Palestine, committing alongside over 1,200 industry figures to boycott collaborations with Israeli film institutions in protest of policies in Gaza, a stance critics from pro-Israel perspectives have linked to groups with alleged ties to designated terrorist organizations, highlighting potential selective application of boycott principles absent similar actions against other conflict zones.\n\nThese affiliations exemplify Stone's participation in Hollywood's prevailing progressive consensus, where symbolic endorsements predominate over direct policy advocacy; for instance, her actions have raised visibility for causes like reproductive access but lack evidence of influencing legislative changes, such as state-level abortion restrictions post-2017 or harassment reporting rates beyond elite circles. Conservative commentators have critiqued such alignments as exemplifying selective outrage, prioritizing issues like abortion funding—despite Planned Parenthood's performance of around 330,000 abortions annually versus other health services—while showing minimal engagement with conservative-leaning social priorities, such as faith-based adoption initiatives or critiques of industry gender imbalances in non-harassment contexts.\n\n## Controversies\n\n### Casting decisions and whitewashing claims\n\nIn the 2015 romantic comedy *Aloha*, directed by Cameron Crowe, Emma Stone portrayed U.S. Air Force pilot Captain Allison Ng, a character scripted as one-quarter Native Hawaiian, one-quarter Chinese, and half Swedish, reflecting Hawaii's prevalent mixed ancestries. The role's description emphasized Ng's internal frustration with her outward appearance not matching her heritage, drawing from real-life inspirations Crowe encountered in Hawaii.\n\nThe casting prompted immediate backlash labeled as whitewashing by Asian American and Native Hawaiian advocacy groups, as well as outlets like NBC News, which contended it exemplified Hollywood's pattern of assigning ethnic roles to white actors, thereby limiting visibility for non-white performers. Critics argued this perpetuated erasure, despite the character's fractional ethnic components allowing for varied phenotypes, including those passing as Caucasian.\n\nCrowe countered that the part was conceived in 2007 for an actress \"of color,\" inspired by redheaded Hawaiian women compelled to repeatedly affirm their backgrounds, and selected Stone to embody that disconnect between self-perception and perception by others.  He later apologized on his website for unintended offense, clarifying no revision of the decision but regret over the uproar. Stone herself reflected that the experience heightened her awareness of representation issues, though she maintained support for the film's artistic intent.\n\nCommercially, *Aloha* faltered, earning $21.1 million domestically and $26.3 million worldwide against a $35 million production budget, contributing to its status as a box-office disappointment amid the controversy. This outcome underscores industry dynamics where high-profile casting secures financing but risks alienating audiences when perceived as inauthentic.\n\nSuch decisions align with Hollywood's longstanding use of ethnically ambiguous scripting to enable versatile talent pools, driven by the causal imperatives of marketability and the scarcity of actors precisely matching rare heritage combinations at star caliber—realities evident in Hawaii's demographics, where over 20% identify as multiracial yet professional acting pipelines remain narrow. Progressive critiques, frequently amplified in media with institutional left-leaning tilts, prioritize representational purity over these pragmatics, contrasting defenses rooted in creative autonomy and the non-literal interpretation of mixed identities.  No comparable controversies arose in Stone's other roles, highlighting *Aloha* as an outlier tied to the character's specified but diluted ethnic markers.\n\n### Responses to film content critiques\n\nSome feminist critics have labeled *Poor Things* (2023) as sexist and exploitative, citing its explicit depictions of female nudity and sexuality as reinforcing the male gaze rather than genuine empowerment. These objections, often rooted in progressive interpretive frameworks, argue that the protagonist Bella Baxter's arc—reanimated with an infant's brain and pursuing sexual liberation—prioritizes male-directed voyeurism over substantive female agency, despite the narrative's focus on her intellectual and physical autonomy.\n\nEmma Stone rebutted these characterizations in February 2024, asserting that the film's portrayal celebrates Bella's unencumbered self-determination, free from societal constraints, as a form of empowerment rather than exploitation. She highlighted the story's origins in Alasdair Gray's 1992 novel, where Bella's journey from dependency to independence underscores causal agency through experiential learning, not victimhood.\n\nCritics of the critiques, including those from non-leftist perspectives, have dismissed such complaints as applying anachronistic ideological filters to fantastical art, arguing that empirical viewer reception—evidenced by the film's 92% Rotten Tomatoes critic score and 80% audience score—reveals broad appeal unmarred by alleged offensiveness. The movie's worldwide box office of $117.6 million on a $35 million budget further indicates commercial viability, suggesting the thematic elements resonated widely without widespread backlash. This success aligns with first-principles evaluation of the narrative's internal logic, where Bella's choices drive plot progression independently of external moral impositions.\n\n### Recent statements on high-profile cases\n\nIn August 2025, during promotion for her film *Bugonia* at the Venice Film Festival, Emma Stone highlighted parallels between the movie's plot—wherein a character kidnaps a pharmaceutical CEO suspecting her of being an alien—and the real-life case of Luigi Mangione, who was charged with the December 4, 2024, murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. Stone described the coincidence as \"terrifying,\" noting that Mangione had publicly criticized healthcare firms for denying coverage to families facing illness, including his own mother's battle with cancer, and suggested audiences view *Bugonia* through this lens, stating, \"What's really crazy, after we had shot the movie, this guy Luigi Mangione shoots the CEO of UnitedHealthcare.\"\n\nThe remarks provoked backlash, with critics and social media users accusing Stone of insensitivity toward a high-profile killing that some progressive outlets and activists framed as a symbolic rebuke to corporate healthcare practices, despite Mangione's act constituting premeditated murder under New York law, complete with shell casings inscribed with words like \"deny,\" \"depose,\" and \"delay.\" Detractors labeled her comments \"tone-deaf\" and \"out of touch,\" arguing they trivialized a violent act amid public frustration with insurance denials, which affected over 1.6 million claims in 2023 alone according to UnitedHealth data, though legal experts emphasized that such grievances do not justify extrajudicial killings, as vigilantism erodes due process and risks escalating unrelated violence. Stone has not publicly responded to the criticism, which amplified via outlets showing a pattern of leniency toward anti-corporate narratives in left-leaning media coverage of Mangione.\n\nAt the 96th Academy Awards on March 10, 2024, Stone's onstage interaction after winning Best Actress for *Poor Things*—where she appeared to hurriedly take the Oscar from presenter Michelle Yeoh while conversing with Jennifer Lawrence—fueled online accusations of rudeness toward Asian winners, including Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan, the latter of whom presented Supporting Actor to Robert Downey Jr. earlier. Asian social media communities and commentators alleged cultural insensitivity or implicit bias, citing the winners' seeming oversight of prior Asian honorees in a year marking milestones for diversity; however, Yeoh later clarified the moment as a \"beautiful misunderstanding\" due to seating confusion and the event's chaos, affirming no offense and praising Stone's win. The episode highlighted how brief, unscripted encounters at high-profile events can be magnified by partisan online narratives, often prioritizing identity optics over context.\n\nDuring *Bugonia* promotions in August 2025, Stone's lighthearted remarks on extraterrestrial life, including joking that she believes in aliens and quipping about handling fame \"without turning into an alien,\" drew minor scrutiny for echoing conspiracy tropes amid the film's premise, but elicited no substantial backlash beyond niche discussions on celebrity detachment from grounded discourse. These statements, tied to promotional whimsy rather than substantive commentary on cases, underscored a broader pattern where actors' offhand opinions on sensational topics invite polarized amplification disproportionate to their depth.",
