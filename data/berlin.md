## Historical Background

### Early History
Berlin's origins trace back to the 13th century, when it emerged as a small trading settlement along the Spree River. The first recorded mention of Berlin dates to 1237, marking the foundation of the Cölln district, one of the city's early cores. By the 15th century, Berlin became the capital of the Margraviate of Brandenburg, laying the groundwork for its future significance in Prussian and German history [Berlin History](https://www.britannica.com/place/Berlin).

### Rise of Prussia and German Empire
In 1701, Berlin became the capital of the Kingdom of Prussia under Frederick I. The city flourished as a center of Enlightenment thought, culture, and military power during the reigns of Frederick the Great (1740–1786). Following the unification of Germany in 1871, Berlin was named the capital of the German Empire, solidifying its status as a political and economic powerhouse. During this period, the city underwent rapid industrialization and urban expansion [Prussian History](https://www.history.com/topics/germany/prussia).

### 20th Century: War and Division
Berlin played a central role in the tumultuous events of the 20th century. After World War I, the city became the epicenter of the Weimar Republic (1919–1933), a period marked by cultural innovation but also political instability. The rise of the Nazi regime in 1933 transformed Berlin into the capital of the Third Reich, and it suffered immense destruction during World War II, with much of the city reduced to rubble by 1945 [WWII Berlin](https://www.ushmm.org/learn/timeline-of-events/1942-1945/bombing-of-berlin).

Post-war, Berlin became a focal point of the Cold War. Divided into East and West Berlin in 1949, the city symbolized the ideological conflict between the Soviet Union and Western Allies. The construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961 physically and politically separated the city until its fall in 1989, an event that marked a turning point in global history. Berlin was officially reunified in 1990, alongside Germany itself, and has since undergone significant redevelopment [Berlin Wall History](https://www.history.com/topics/cold-war/berlin-wall).
