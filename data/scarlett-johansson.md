# Scarlett Johansson

Scarlett Ingrid Johansson (born November 22, 1984) is an American actress, singer, and producer.
She began her career as a child actor in the mid-1990s and achieved breakthrough recognition with dramatic roles in *Lost in Translation* (2003) and *Girl with a Pearl Earring* (2003), earning Academy Award nominations for Best Actress in a Supporting Role and Best Actress, respectively.
Johansson subsequently starred as Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow in ten films within the Marvel Cinematic Universe from 2010 to 2021, contributing to franchise installments that collectively grossed tens of billions worldwide and establishing her as a leading action star.

Her filmography spans independent cinema, blockbusters, and voice work, with total worldwide box office earnings as a lead actor exceeding $14 billion, making her the highest-grossing lead actress in history.
Johansson has received numerous accolades, including a Tony Award for Best Performance by a Featured Actress in a Play for *A View from the Bridge* (2010), a British Academy Film Award, and multiple Golden Globe nominations.
Forbes has repeatedly ranked her among the world's highest-paid actresses, with earnings of $56 million in 2019 alone from endorsements and backend deals.

Throughout her career, Johansson has encountered controversies, particularly over casting decisions perceived by critics as insensitive to identity politics, such as her roles in *Ghost in the Shell* (2017) and the abandoned *Rub \u0026 Tug* (2018), where she defended artistic merit over demands for demographic matching.
More recently, she pursued legal action against Disney in 2021 over the hybrid release of *Black Widow*, which she argued violated her exclusive theatrical contract, resulting in a settlement, and publicly opposed unauthorized use of her likeness in AI technologies, including a 2024 dispute with OpenAI.

## Early Life

### Family and Upbringing

Scarlett Ingrid Johansson was born on November 22, 1984, in Manhattan, New York City.  Her father, Karsten Olaf Johansson, is a Danish-born architect originally from Copenhagen, while her mother, Melanie Sloan, is a producer from a Jewish family in the Bronx with ancestry tracing to Poland and Russia.  

Johansson grew up as the youngest of four children sharing parents, alongside a fraternal twin brother, Hunter Johansson, an older sister, Vanessa Johansson (an actress), and an older brother, Adrian Johansson; she also has an older half-brother, Christian Johansson, from her father's previous marriage, and a younger adopted sister, Fenan Sloan, through her mother's family.  The family resided in Manhattan, where Johansson later described their circumstances as low-income, noting that they relied on welfare and food stamps during her early years.

Her parents divorced in 1997, when Johansson was 13 years old, after which her mother relocated to California while Johansson and her twin brother remained primarily with their father in New York.  Sloan's involvement in the entertainment industry influenced the household, as she initially managed Johansson's burgeoning acting career, fostering an environment oriented toward creative pursuits amid financial challenges.

### Education and Initial Aspirations

Johansson developed an interest in acting at a young age, beginning to audition for commercials around age seven and enrolling in acting classes shortly thereafter. Her mother facilitated early exposure by taking her to auditions, leading to professional acting debut in childhood. From ages eight to eleven, she studied at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute, where she trained in the Method acting technique and performed before live audiences. 

She later attended the Professional Children's School in Manhattan, a private institution designed for working child performers, allowing her to balance rigorous academics with acting commitments. Johansson graduated from high school there, achieving honor student status while pursuing roles.  At age thirteen, she described managing school alongside auditions and filming, emphasizing the demands of her early career path.

Her initial aspirations centered on acting, forgoing higher education plans such as attendance at Purchase College in New York to focus on professional opportunities after high school graduation in 2002. This commitment to performance over formal collegiate study aligned with her trajectory from child roles to breakthrough films in her late teens.

## Acting Career

### Early Roles and Breakthrough (1994–2002)

Johansson made her film debut at the age of nine in the 1994 fantasy comedy *North*, directed by Rob Reiner, where she portrayed Laura, the daughter of John Ritter's character in a story about a boy searching for ideal parents. The film received mixed reviews and modest box office performance, but it marked her entry into feature films after earlier off-Broadway stage work. She followed with small supporting roles, including as the daughter of Sean Connery and Kate Capshaw's characters in the thriller *Just Cause* (1995) and a brief appearance in the romantic comedy *If Lucy Fell* (1996).

In 1996, Johansson secured her first leading role in the independent drama *Manny \u0026 Lo*, playing the younger sister Lo, a runaway who bonds with an older pregnant sibling and a kidnapped nurse; the performance earned her a nomination for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Female Lead at age 12. She continued with minor parts in *Fall* (1997), a short film, and as Molly Pruitt, the resourceful neighbor girl assisting the young protagonist against spies, in the family comedy *Home Alone 3* (1997), which grossed over $79 million worldwide despite critical panning. Johansson also appeared in the low-budget comedy *My Brother the Pig* (1998) as a sibling in a fantastical family tale.

Her role as Grace MacLean in Robert Redford's directorial debut *The Horse Whisperer* (1998) brought wider notice; at 13, she depicted a tomboyish teenager who loses part of her leg in a tragic riding accident that kills her friend and traumatizes her horse, prompting her mother to seek help from Redford's horse trainer character. The film, adapted from Nicholas Evans' novel, earned $189 million globally and drew praise for Johansson's natural portrayal of grief and resilience. Johansson took on supporting roles in *An American Rhapsody* (2001), as a young Hungarian-American orphan, and the horror-comedy *Eight Legged Freaks* (2002), as Ashley Parker, a deputy aiding in a giant spider invasion. Her breakthrough arrived with *Ghost World* (2001), where she played Rebecca, the more conventional best friend to Thora Birch's nonconformist Enid; the black comedy adaptation of Daniel Clowes' graphic novel showcased her dry wit and earned critical acclaim for elevating her from child actor to emerging talent.

### Transition to Mature Roles and Independent Cinema (2003–2009)

In 2003, Johansson transitioned from adolescent characters to more mature roles, starring as Charlotte in Sofia Coppola's *Lost in Translation*, a film depicting the unlikely friendship between a disillusioned Hollywood actor and a newlywed photographer adrift in Tokyo. The independent production, with a budget of approximately $4 million, grossed over $119 million worldwide and earned critical praise for its introspective portrayal of isolation and connection. Johansson's subdued performance as the introspective Charlotte garnered her a BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role, marking her first major industry accolade for adult dramatic work.

That same year, she portrayed Griet, the silent servant girl muse to painter Johannes Vermeer, in Peter Webber's *Girl with a Pearl Earring*, an adaptation of Tracy Chevalier's novel emphasizing quiet tension and artistic inspiration over 17th-century Dutch life. The period drama, produced on a modest $12 million budget, received six Academy Award nominations, including for cinematography and costume design, highlighting Johansson's ability to convey emotion through minimal dialogue and expressive restraint. Critics noted her emergence as a versatile actress capable of anchoring art-house narratives distinct from her earlier teen-oriented films.

Johansson continued exploring complex adult dynamics in Woody Allen's *Match Point* (2005), playing Nola Rice, an ambitious aspiring actress entangled in an extramarital affair that drives the film's examination of class, morality, and chance in London high society. Released with a $15 million budget, the psychological thriller marked Allen's return to dramatic territory and Johansson's second collaboration with him, earning her praise for embodying seductive vulnerability amid the story's moral descent. The film achieved commercial success, grossing $85 million globally, and positioned Johansson as a draw for European-set independent dramas.

By 2008, in Allen's *Vicky Cristina Barcelona*, Johansson embodied Cristina, a free-spirited American artist pursuing unconventional desires during a summer in Spain, alongside Javier Bardem and Penélope Cruz in a tale of polyamory and cultural clash. The $15.5 million production premiered at Cannes and grossed $96 million, with Johansson's portrayal of hedonistic curiosity contributing to the film's light yet incisive critique of romantic idealism. These roles in lower-budget, director-driven projects from 2003 to 2009 solidified her reputation for selecting scripts prioritizing character nuance over commercial spectacle, often in ensemble or lead capacities that demanded emotional subtlety and physical poise.

### Blockbuster Era and Director Collaborations (2010–2013)

Johansson entered the blockbuster realm with her portrayal of Natasha Romanoff, also known as Black Widow, in *Iron Man 2* (2010), directed by Jon Favreau, marking her introduction to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The film premiered on April 26, 2010, at the El Capitan Theatre and was released theatrically in the United States on May 7, 2010. Her character, initially undercover as Natalie Rushman, showcased combat skills and espionage, setting the stage for future MCU appearances.

This role expanded in *The Avengers* (2012), directed by Joss Whedon, where Johansson reprised Black Widow as part of the ensemble led by Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, and Hawkeye. Released on May 4, 2012, the film assembled these heroes to combat Loki's invasion, grossing $1,520,538,536 worldwide and setting multiple box office records as the third-highest-grossing film at the time. Johansson's performance highlighted Black Widow's strategic intelligence and physical prowess amid high-stakes action sequences.

Parallel to these commercial successes, Johansson collaborated with auteur directors on more introspective projects. In *Under the Skin* (2013), directed by Jonathan Glazer, she played an enigmatic alien entity seducing and preying on men in Scotland, delivering a largely silent, physically demanding performance that emphasized themes of otherness and predation. The film premiered at the Telluride Film Festival in 2013 and earned critical acclaim for its atmospheric tension and Johansson's transformative role.

She provided the voice for the operating system Samantha in *Her* (2013), written and directed by Spike Jonze, exploring a man's romantic attachment to an AI in a near-future setting. Johansson replaced Samantha Morton in the role after initial filming, with her vocal performance conveying emotional depth and evolving sentience, contributing to the film's 95% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Additionally, in *Don Jon* (2013), directed by and co-starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Johansson portrayed Barbara Sugarman, a woman challenging the protagonist's porn addiction and superficial ideals, blending comedy with relational critique. These diverse collaborations underscored her versatility, balancing franchise demands with independent cinema's artistic risks.

### Franchise Dominance and Commercial Peak (2014–2020)

Johansson solidified her status as a blockbuster mainstay in 2014 with the lead role in *Lucy*, a science fiction thriller directed by Luc Besson that grossed $469 million worldwide on a $40 million budget, marking one of her earliest solo commercial hits outside the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). That year, she also reprised Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow in *Captain America: The Winter Soldier*, an MCU entry that earned $714 million globally, further embedding her in the franchise's expanding narrative of espionage and superhero team-ups. These roles highlighted her transition from indie acclaim to high-stakes action, with *Lucy*'s pseudoscientific premise of human potential unlocking drawing $126 million domestically alone.

The following years saw Johansson's Black Widow evolve into a core ensemble figure across MCU tentpoles, driving unprecedented box office dominance. In *Avengers: Age of Ultron* (2015), her character's deepened backstory and combat prowess contributed to the film's $1.405 billion worldwide haul, the second-highest grosser of its year despite a $365 million net production cost. She returned in *Captain America: Civil War* (2016), where Black Widow's divided loyalties amid superhero schisms helped propel earnings to $1.153 billion, reinforcing the franchise's formula of interconnected conflicts yielding massive returns. Johansson's salary for these MCU appearances escalated, reflecting her value; by *Avengers: Infinity War* (2018), which grossed $2.052 billion—the fourth-highest ever at release—her pretax earnings reached eight figures per film, underscoring the character's draw in ensemble dynamics.

This period peaked commercially with *Avengers: Endgame* (2019), where Johansson's Black Widow arc culminated in a sacrificial resolution, aiding the film's record-shattering $2.8 billion worldwide gross and cementing her as a linchpin in the MCU's Infinity Saga payoff. The film's success, bolstered by her prior buildup across nine MCU credits, propelled Johansson's cumulative franchise contributions to over $10 billion in global box office, per aggregate data. Forbes ranked her the world's highest-paid actress in 2018 and 2019, with $40.5 million and $56 million in pretax earnings respectively, largely from Marvel backend deals and endorsements tied to these blockbusters. Outside MCU, ventures like the voice role in animated hit *Sing* (2016), grossing $634 million, and the live-action *Ghost in the Shell* (2017), which earned $169 million but underperformed against its $110 million budget, illustrated attempts at franchise extension met with mixed financial results. Overall, Johansson's 2014–2020 output emphasized scalable IP reliance, yielding her position as Hollywood's top-grossing lead actress by decade's end, with MCU films accounting for the bulk of her $15 billion-plus career totals.

### Post-Franchise Expansion and Directing Debut (2021–present)

Following the theatrical and Disney+ release of *Black Widow* on July 9, 2021, Johansson shifted focus to independent and auteur-driven projects, marking a departure from large-scale franchises. In 2023, she starred as Midge Campbell, a celebrated but emotionally distant actress, in Wes Anderson's *Asteroid City*, an ensemble comedy-drama set in a 1950s desert town disrupted by extraterrestrial events. The film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival on May 24, 2023, and expanded to wide release on June 23, 2023, earning praise for its stylistic precision despite mixed commercial performance.

Johansson expanded into production and lead roles with the 2024 romantic comedy *Fly Me to the Moon*, directed by Greg Berlanti, where she played Kelly Jones, a sharp advertising executive tasked with staging a fake moon landing as a contingency for NASA's 1969 Apollo 11 mission. Co-starring Channing Tatum as launch director Cole Davis, the film was released in theaters on July 12, 2024, blending historical fiction with screwball elements and grossing over $48 million worldwide against a $25 million budget.

In animation, Johansson voiced Elita-1, a resourceful Cybertronian leader and former mining supervisor, in *Transformers One*, an origin story prequel directed by Josh Cooley and released on September 20, 2024. Featuring voice talents like Chris Hemsworth as Optimus Prime, the film emphasized character-driven storytelling over action spectacle, achieving critical acclaim with a 90% Rotten Tomatoes score and strong opening weekend earnings exceeding $30 million domestically.

Johansson made her feature directorial debut with *Eleanor the Great*, a dark comedy examining family secrets and the consequences of deception in old age. Starring June Squibb as the titular 94-year-old Eleanor, who relocates to New York City with her family after her best friend's death and fabricates a Holocaust survivor backstory, the film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in May 2025 before a limited theatrical release on September 26, 2025. Johansson, who also produced, drew inspiration from real-life familial observations, aiming to explore moral ambiguities without sentimentality; the project received a 66% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with reviewers noting its tonal shifts between humor and pathos.

In November 2025, Johansson was announced to star in a new *Exorcist* film, a fresh take on the horror franchise directed and written by Mike Flanagan, produced by Blumhouse, Atomic Monster, and Morgan Creek Entertainment, and distributed by Universal.
## Music and Multimedia Ventures

### Vocal Performances and Albums

Johansson's debut album, *Anywhere I Lay My Head*, was released on May 20, 2008, by Rhino Records and featured ten covers of Tom Waits songs alongside one original track, "Song for Jo," produced by TV on the Radio's David Sitek with contributions from members of the band and guests like Sean Watson on brass. The project originated from Johansson's long-standing admiration for Waits, whom she had attempted to contact for permission years earlier, though Waits himself did not participate and later publicly disavowed it, stating he found the interpretations "really bad." Commercially, the album peaked at number 25 on the UK Albums Chart and number 78 on the US Billboard 200, selling fewer than 30,000 copies in the United States in its first week and under 25,000 worldwide in total, reflecting limited market reception.  Critics offered mixed assessments, praising the production's experimental edge but critiquing Johansson's breathy, stylized delivery as lacking emotional depth or technical prowess compared to Waits' gravelly originals.

In September 2009, Johansson followed with *Break Up*, a collaborative effort with singer-songwriter Pete Yorn released on V2 Records/Cooperative Music, comprising nine duets recorded in separate sessions—Johansson in New York and Yorn in Los Angeles—modeled after the conversational style of Serge Gainsbourg and Brigitte Bardot's 1960s pairings, with Yorn handling instrumentation and Johansson providing vocals. The lead single, "Relator," was issued digitally on May 25, 2009, and the album debuted at number 58 on the US Billboard 200, achieving modest sales of around 20,000 copies in its first week amid promotional live performances by the duo, including appearances on *The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien*. Reception highlighted the album's intimate, lo-fi charm and Yorn's songwriting but noted Johansson's vocals as competent yet overshadowed by her celebrity status rather than musical innovation, contributing to its status as a niche release without broader commercial traction.

Beyond full-length albums, Johansson contributed vocals to select singles, including "Falling Down" (2008), a collaboration with The Jesus and Mary Chain from her *Anywhere I Lay My Head* sessions that charted at number 139 on the UK Singles Chart, and "Before My Time" (2012), a duet with J. Ralph for the documentary *Chasing Ice*, which earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song despite not winning. These efforts, along with sporadic live outings such as headlining the Dot to Dot Festival in 2009, underscored her intermittent pursuit of music as a secondary vocation to acting, yielding no sustained discography or touring career. Overall, Johansson's recorded output has been characterized by exploratory covers and partnerships rather than original songwriting, with sales and critical consensus indicating underperformance relative to her film prominence.

### Voice Acting and Production Roles

Johansson's voice acting debut came in the animated adventure *The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie* (2004), where she voiced Princess Mindy, the daughter of King Neptune who aids the protagonists SpongeBob and Patrick. She later provided the voice for Samantha, an advanced artificial intelligence operating system, in Spike Jonze's *Her* (2013), delivering a disembodied performance that conveyed intimacy and philosophical nuance without visual presence.

In Jon Favreau's live-action adaptation *The Jungle Book* (2016), Johansson voiced Kaa, the seductive and hypnotic python, employing a sultry tone to portray the character's manipulative allure. That same year, she lent her voice to Ash, a rebellious porcupine aspiring to be a rock singer, in Garth Jennings' animated musical *Sing*, reprising the role in the 2021 sequel *Sing 2*. Johansson voiced Nutmeg, a resourceful stray dog, in Wes Anderson's stop-motion film *Isle of Dogs* (2018). Her most recent major voice role was as Elita-1, a protoform Transformer and Optimus Prime's early ally, in the animated prequel *Transformers One* (2024).

Transitioning to production, Johansson co-founded the film and television company These Pictures in 2022 to develop projects with greater creative control. She served as executive producer on the Marvel film *Black Widow* (2021), which focused on her character's backstory. Through These Pictures, Johansson produced *Fly Me to the Moon* (2024), a romantic comedy-drama in which she starred opposite Channing Tatum. In 2025, she produced and made her directorial debut with *Eleanor the Great*, a coming-of-age story starring June Squibb as an 88-year-old woman pursuing higher education. Johansson has also executive produced upcoming projects like the Amazon limited series *Just Cause*. In June 2025, she requested Marvel Studios remove her executive producer credit from *Thunderbolts\**, citing no substantive involvement in its development.

## Controversies and Public Disputes

### Casting Choices and Identity-Based Criticisms

Johansson faced significant backlash for her casting as Major Motoko Kusanagi in the 2017 live-action adaptation of *Ghost in the Shell*, a role originating from a Japanese manga and anime series featuring an Asian protagonist. Critics accused the production of "whitewashing" by selecting a white actress for the lead, prompting a Change.org petition with over 50,000 signatures calling for an Asian replacement. Johansson defended the choice by noting the character's cyborg nature and ambiguous ethnic origins in the film's narrative, where the Major's human past involves a white woman whose brain was transplanted into a synthetic shell, though this did not quell accusations of cultural erasure. The original anime director, Mamoru Oshii, stated there was "no basis" for the whitewashing anger, emphasizing that Kusanagi's portrayal had varied across adaptations and that Johansson was selected for her acting suitability rather than ethnicity. Despite the controversy, the film proceeded to release on March 31, 2017, grossing $169.8 million worldwide against a $110 million budget, but it underperformed expectations amid divided reviews.

In 2018, Johansson encountered further criticism for accepting the role of transgender man Dante "Tex" Gill in the biopic *Rub \u0026 Tug*, sparking debates over whether cisgender actors should portray transgender characters, particularly given limited opportunities for trans performers in Hollywood. Advocacy groups and actors like Trace Lysette and Zackary Drucker argued that such casting perpetuated exclusion, with GLAAD highlighting the scarcity of trans representation behind the camera as well. Johansson initially responded by asserting her experience playing diverse roles, including in *Under the Skin* and *Ghost in the Shell*, and questioned restrictions on actors' range, but withdrew from the project on July 13, 2018, citing evolving cultural understandings of transgender experiences and ethical considerations. In a 2019 interview, she acknowledged mishandling the situation, describing her earlier comments as "tone-deaf" and reflecting on the need for greater sensitivity amid industry shifts toward authentic representation. The film was ultimately shelved, later adapted into a TV project without Johansson.

These incidents fueled broader discussions on "politically correct" casting, with Johansson later criticizing constraints that limit actors to roles matching their identities, stating in July 2019 that she supported anyone's right to play any role, even "a tree," while facing accusations of insensitivity from progressive media outlets. Proponents of her view argued that merit-based selection prioritizes performance over identity politics, citing her proven box-office draw, whereas detractors, often from advocacy circles, emphasized systemic barriers for underrepresented groups, though empirical data on casting impacts remains debated without consensus on causal effects beyond anecdotal claims. No legal or professional repercussions ensued from either controversy, and Johansson continued securing high-profile roles thereafter.

### Legal Battles with Studios and Tech Firms

In July 2021, Johansson filed a breach-of-contract lawsuit against The Walt Disney Company in Los Angeles Superior Court, alleging that the studio's decision to release *Black Widow* simultaneously in theaters and on Disney+ on July 9, 2021, violated her talent agreement, which stipulated an exclusive theatrical window to maximize box office performance and trigger backend compensation bonuses. Johansson's contract entitled her to a base salary of $20 million plus a percentage of profits if the film exceeded certain box office thresholds, but she claimed the hybrid release strategy—adopted amid the COVID-19 pandemic—deprived her of an estimated $50 million or more in potential earnings, as evidenced by the film's $379 million global theatrical gross falling short of projections without streaming metrics factored into her deal. Disney countered that Johansson's compensation was already substantial, that the pandemic justified the release change, and that she had approved the strategy, but the dispute was resolved through an undisclosed settlement on September 30, 2021, with reports indicating Disney paid Johansson approximately $40 million to cover her claims.

Johansson has also pursued actions against technology companies over unauthorized use of her likeness and voice in AI applications. In November 2023, she initiated legal proceedings against LOVO, an AI voice synthesis firm, after the company featured her name, image, and a synthetic voice mimicking hers in promotional materials for its text-to-speech platform without consent, prompting a DMCA takedown notice and demands for cessation of the unauthorized commercial exploitation. Separately, in May 2024, Johansson's legal team sent a cease-and-desist letter to OpenAI, accusing the firm of deliberately imitating her distinctive voice—reminiscent of her performance as an AI in the 2013 film *Her*—for its ChatGPT voice mode option named "Sky," despite her prior rejection of CEO Sam Altman's personal request to license her voice for the project. OpenAI suspended the "Sky" voice rollout following the demand, stating it was trained on a different actress who happened to sound similar, but Johansson argued the move violated her right of publicity and highlighted broader risks of AI infringing on performers' control over their vocal identity amid unclear regulations. As of late 2024, no formal lawsuit had been filed against OpenAI, though the incident underscored ongoing tensions between Hollywood talent and AI developers over intellectual property rights.

### Political Stances and Backlash

Scarlett Johansson has expressed left-leaning political positions on domestic issues, including strong opposition to Donald Trump. In a January 21, 2017, speech at the Women's March on Washington, she directly addressed Trump, stating, "I did not vote for you," and urged him to support women's rights and health initiatives. She described his administration as "scary" in a March 2017 interview and vowed continued activism against him ahead of the 2020 election. Johansson endorsed Hillary Clinton in 2016, emphasizing support for Planned Parenthood amid threats to its funding, and revealed her personal use of the organization's services for health care.

Her financial contributions align with Democratic candidates. Johansson donated the maximum allowable $2,800 to Elizabeth Warren's 2019 presidential campaign and $3,300 to Kamala Harris in 2024. She participated in the 2018 Los Angeles Women's March, where she criticized sexual misconduct in Hollywood, indirectly referencing figures like James Franco who supported anti-harassment initiatives publicly while facing allegations privately.

A notable divergence occurred in her stance on Israel, leading to backlash from pro-Palestinian activists. In 2014, Johansson became a global ambassador for SodaStream, an Israeli company operating a factory in a West Bank settlement, prompting Oxfam to end their eight-year partnership with her due to irreconcilable differences over the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement against Israel. She defended the decision, stating a "fundamental difference of opinion" with Oxfam's advocacy for BDS, which she opposed. This position drew criticism from left-wing groups; in January 2018, Palestinian-American organizations withdrew from the Los Angeles Women's March citing her involvement as a speaker due to her pro-Israel advocacy.

By 2021, Johansson reflected that actors lack obligations for public political engagement and that personal views should not influence professional opportunities, amid broader discussions of celebrity activism in Hollywood. Her positions have generally aligned with industry norms on U.S. politics but highlighted tensions within progressive circles over Israel policy.

## Public Image and Cultural Impact

### Media Depictions and Objectification Debates

Scarlett Johansson's media depictions have often emphasized her physical appearance, establishing her as a prominent sex symbol in Hollywood since the mid-2000s. Esquire magazine named her the Sexiest Woman Alive in both 2006 and 2013, highlighting her curves and allure in features that focused extensively on her body rather than her performances. This portrayal extended to red carpet coverage and tabloid stories, where commentary frequently reduced her to attributes like her figure, contributing to a public image that overshadowed her dramatic roles in films such as *Lost in Translation* (2003).

Johansson has repeatedly addressed the objectification in interviews, describing how early career hypersexualization pigeonholed her into "sex object" roles and led her to fear her professional viability. In a 2022 appearance on the *Armchair Expert* podcast, she stated that after roles in films like *Girl with a Pearl Earring* (2003), she felt "objectified and pigeonholed" into provocative parts, believing "my career was over" due to limited offers for substantive characters. She elaborated in a 2025 Vanity Fair interview that journalists, both male and female, blatantly objectified her during her teens and early 20s, grooming her into a "bombshell-type" actor despite her youth. Johansson has criticized the industry's double standards, noting in 2014 that male stars face less scrutiny for their looks compared to women like herself.

Debates surrounding her objectification center on the tension between commercial success and artistic agency, with critics arguing that media focus on her sexuality undermines recognition of her range, as seen in her Academy Award-nominated performances. Films like *Under the Skin* (2013), featuring full-frontal nudity, have been interpreted as both exploiting and subverting objectification tropes, with analyses positing Johansson's choices as a deliberate feminist critique of the male gaze. However, Johansson has expressed regret over being typecast as hypersexualized, stating in 2019 that it cost her roles suiting her "curvy, confident" physique, while acknowledging the unsustainability of such an image in Hollywood's evolving standards. Despite these concerns, her portrayal as Black Widow in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, with form-fitting costumes, amplified the sex symbol narrative, boosting box office earnings but fueling discussions on whether it perpetuated or commodified female representation.

### Influence on Industry Standards and Box Office Records

Johansson's films in leading roles have grossed more than $14.8 billion worldwide as of July 2025, establishing her as the highest-grossing lead actor in cinematic history. This record was cemented by the July 2025 release of *Jurassic World Rebirth*, which debuted to $318 million globally and added substantially to her tally, surpassing previous benchmarks set by male counterparts in lead positions. Her contributions to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, including *Avengers: Endgame* (2019, $2.8 billion worldwide) and *Avengers: Infinity War* (2018, $2.05 billion), accounted for roughly $8.7 billion of this total when combined with other ensemble entries like *Captain America: Civil War* (2016, $1.15 billion).

These earnings reflect Johansson's consistent draw in franchise-driven blockbusters, with her solo vehicle *Black Widow* (2021) generating $379.8 million despite pandemic-era constraints, marking it as one of the top female-led superhero films at the time. Earlier successes, such as *Lucy* (2014, $469.3 million worldwide), further underscored her bankability in action genres, where she outperformed expectations for female protagonists in cerebral, high-concept narratives.

Her box office dominance has shaped industry standards by empirically validating the profitability of female-led action spectacles, countering historical underinvestment in such projects amid doubts about audience appeal. Studios have since prioritized versatile female leads capable of anchoring tentpole releases, as evidenced by increased greenlighting of projects featuring actors with comparable crossover appeal, while her records—built on 30+ years of output—highlight the causal link between sustained performance and expanded opportunities for women in commercial cinema. This shift is quantifiable in the post-2010s surge of billion-dollar female-fronted franchises, where Johansson's precedents reduced perceived financial risks.

## Personal Life

### Relationships and Family Dynamics

Scarlett Johansson was born on November 22, 1984, in New York City to father Karsten Johansson, a Danish-born architect, and mother Melanie Sloan, a producer from an Ashkenazi Jewish family in the Bronx.  Her parents divorced in 1997, after which her mother relocated to California with some of the children while maintaining involvement in Johansson's early career as a manager and producer. Johansson has described her upbringing as financially modest, with her family relying on food stamps at times, which fostered a close-knit dynamic among siblings despite the divorce.

She has five siblings: older half-sister Christianna from her mother's previous marriage, older brother Adrian, fraternal twin brother Hunter (also born November 22, 1984), and younger sister Vanessa.  Johansson has collaborated professionally with Hunter, who works as a producer, and has publicly acknowledged the supportive role her family played in her development, including shared experiences in acting and creative pursuits.

Johansson's romantic relationships have included high-profile partnerships leading to three marriages. She married actor Ryan Reynolds on September 27, 2008, after dating since 2007; the couple separated on December 14, 2010, and finalized their divorce in July 2011, with no children from the union.  She wed French journalist Romain Dauriac on October 1, 2014, shortly after the birth of their daughter Rose Dorothy Dauriac on August 30, 2014, in New York City; they divorced in September 2017 following a custody dispute, agreeing to joint physical custody of Rose. 

In 2020, Johansson married comedian Colin Jost in an intimate ceremony in Tuxedo, New York, announced publicly on October 29 via social media; the couple welcomed son Cosmo Jost in August 2021.  Johansson has emphasized maintaining strict privacy around her children, limiting public disclosures about Rose and Cosmo to protect their upbringing from media scrutiny, while co-parenting amicably with Dauriac across international distances. This approach reflects a deliberate family dynamic prioritizing stability and normalcy amid her career demands.

### Health and Privacy Challenges

In September 2011, private nude photographs of Johansson, taken by herself for personal use, were hacked from her cellphone and posted online without her consent, prompting her to describe the incident as an "unjust" and "wrong" invasion of privacy. The perpetrator, Christopher Chaney, accessed accounts of multiple celebrities via phishing and password guessing, leading to federal charges; he was sentenced to 10 years in prison in December 2012 for unauthorized computer access and wire fraud. Johansson's legal team issued cease-and-desist notices to websites hosting the images shortly after their appearance on September 15, 2011, highlighting the unauthorized dissemination's role in exacerbating the breach.

Johansson has since expressed ongoing concerns about personal boundaries, citing repeated privacy encroachments by fans and paparazzi as reasons for declining photo requests in public spaces, noting that such interactions can feel intrusive and offensive despite her appreciation for support. This stance reflects broader challenges in maintaining autonomy amid celebrity status, where digital and physical intrusions compound, as evidenced by her 2011 experience normalizing non-consensual sharing of intimate content.

On health matters, Johansson has disclosed struggles with severe acne that persisted into adulthood, impacting her self-image and contributing to mental health difficulties, including near-depressive states exacerbated by the condition's visibility in her profession. She addressed these issues by developing her skincare brand, The Outset, launched in 2022, emphasizing non-aggressive treatments informed by her experiences with ineffective prior remedies that worsened irritation. While not detailing chronic physical ailments publicly, she has advocated for proactive gynecological care and screenings to mitigate reproductive health risks, drawing from general women's health discussions rather than personal diagnoses.

## Philanthropy and Social Engagement

### Charitable Initiatives

Johansson served as a Global Ambassador for Oxfam from 2007 to 2014, focusing on poverty alleviation and humanitarian aid; she traveled to India and Sri Lanka in February 2007, which prompted her involvement, and later visited Kenya, producing a video journal documenting the organization's work there. Her tenure ended in January 2014 following a conflict with Oxfam over her endorsement of SodaStream, an Israeli company operating in the West Bank, which the charity viewed as incompatible with its positions on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

She has been a vocal supporter of Planned Parenthood, filming a public service announcement in April 2011 opposing proposed cuts to $300 million in federal funding for women's health services, designing a T-shirt in 2014 to raise awareness and funds for the organization, and speaking at Variety's Power of Women event in October 2016, where she was honored for her advocacy on reproductive health access. Johansson revealed in January 2017 during a Women's March speech that she relied on Planned Parenthood for healthcare as a teenager from a low-income family.

In April 2011, Johansson endorsed USA Harvest, a nonprofit that collects and distributes food to combat hunger, drawing from her family's experiences with food insecurity during her childhood. Through her skincare brand The Outset, she committed in April 2022 to donating 10% of Earth Month sales—up to $25,000—to One Tree Planted for wildfire reforestation efforts in the United States and Canada.

Johansson has also contributed to broader causes, including support for the Entertainment Industry Foundation's initiatives against cancer and poverty, as well as Soles4Souls, which provides footwear and clothing to aid poverty relief.

### Activism and Policy Positions

Johansson has advocated for access to abortion and reproductive health services, describing the right to abortion as a human rights issue during a 2016 speech at the Hollywood Reporter's Power of Women luncheon. She has repeatedly supported Planned Parenthood, releasing a video in January 2014 urging opposition to measures barring the organization from federal health programs. In a January 2017 address at the Women's March in Washington, D.C., Johansson disclosed using Planned Parenthood services at age 15 for birth control and emphasized the organization's role in providing essential health care beyond abortion, while criticizing efforts to defund it. 

Politically, Johansson has aligned with Democratic candidates, endorsing Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 U.S. presidential election by assembling a video featuring Marvel Cinematic Universe co-stars including Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans to encourage voter mobilization.  She participated in the 2017 Women's March, linking personal responsibility to broader feminist principles in her speech. Johansson has expressed intent to continue political engagement, stating in February 2017 that she had no plans to cease using her voice on such matters.

In 2014, Johansson became the global brand ambassador for SodaStream, an Israeli company with a factory in the Ma'ale Adumim settlement in the West Bank, defending the role for its employment of both Israelis and Palestinians and potential to foster economic cooperation. This decision led to her resignation from an eight-year ambassadorship with Oxfam, which opposes operations in Israeli settlements and supports the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement against Israel; Johansson cited irreconcilable differences on the BDS issue. She affirmed awareness of the factory's location prior to the endorsement and expressed no regrets, prioritizing the company's contributions to workplace integration over settlement concerns.

Johansson has critiqued expectations for actors to maintain public political neutrality, arguing in a 2021 interview that it is unfair to demand such roles from performers while allowing similar views from other professions. She has also pushed back against constraints on casting choices attributed to political correctness, particularly amid controversies over her roles in films like *Rub \u0026 Tug* (2018) and *Ghost in the Shell* (2017).

## Awards and Professional Recognition
