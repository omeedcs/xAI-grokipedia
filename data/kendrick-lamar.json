  "content": "# Kendrick Lamar\n\nKendrick Lamar Duckworth (born June 17, 1987) is an American rapper, songwriter, and record producer raised in Compton, California. His music draws from personal experiences in a gang-afflicted environment, incorporating themes of racial identity, systemic inequality, and moral introspection through dense, narrative-driven lyricism.\n\nLamar gained widespread recognition with his 2012 major-label debut *good kid, m.A.A.d city*, a concept album chronicling Compton street life that topped the Billboard 200 and earned platinum certification. Subsequent releases like *To Pimp a Butterfly* (2015) and *DAMN.* (2017) blended jazz, funk, and hip-hop elements to critique American society, with the latter securing the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for Music—the first awarded to a non-jazz or classical work. He has amassed 22 Grammy Awards, including five for the 2024 diss track \"Not Like Us\" amid a publicized rivalry with fellow rapper Drake, marking his status as one of hip-hop's most decorated artists. Lamar's output, including the 2024 album *GNX*, continues to dominate charts, with three titles simultaneously in the Billboard 200 top 10—a first for any rap act.\n\n## Early life\n\n### Upbringing in Compton\n\nKendrick Lamar Duckworth was born on June 17, 1987, in Compton, California, to parents Kenneth \"Kenny\" Duckworth, a former gang member and manual laborer, and Paula Oliver, a hairdresser.  Both parents originated from Chicago's South Side and relocated to Compton in the early 1980s seeking respite from urban gang violence there, only to confront analogous perils in a city dominated by Bloods and Crips rivalries.  Named after Eddie Kendricks of The Temptations by his mother, Lamar was the eldest of four children, including a younger brother and two sisters, raised primarily in the city's west side amid subsidized Section 8 housing projects like those near McDonalds Park. \n\nCompton's environment during Lamar's youth was marked by the crack cocaine epidemic's devastation, widespread poverty, and frequent interpersonal violence, with the city recording homicide rates exceeding 80 per 100,000 residents in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Lamar witnessed his first murder at age five, when a drug dealer was killed outside his apartment unit during a transaction gone awry, an event that underscored the casual lethality of street life. The 1992 Los Angeles riots, sparked by the Rodney King verdict, further imprinted chaos on his early memories, as fires and unrest engulfed nearby areas, though his family remained insulated from direct participation.\n\nDespite immersion in this milieu—living blocks from Piru Street, a Bloods stronghold—Lamar maintained neutrality, avoiding affiliation with gangs due to his parents' strict oversight and interventions, including his father's admonitions drawn from personal scrapes with Compton's underworld.  Kenny Duckworth's pre-Compton ties to Chicago's Gangster Disciples and a near-fatal label manager encounter before Lamar's birth exemplified the perils his family evaded, fostering a household emphasis on discipline over delinquency. This upbringing instilled a observer's perspective on Compton's dualities of resilience and ruin, shaping Lamar's later reflections without endorsing romanticized narratives of inevitable immersion.\n\n### Education and initial musical exposure\n\nLamar attended the Vanguard Learning Center during seventh grade, where English teacher Regis Inge introduced him to poetry assignments that helped him overcome a stuttering problem and shyness, igniting an interest in language and storytelling. He later transferred to Centennial High School in Compton, graduating as a straight-A student in an environment characterized as gang-affiliated territory with graduation rates below the state average.\n\nFrom childhood, Lamar's parents, Kenny Duckworth and Paula Oliver, exposed him to a broad spectrum of music including oldies, 1990s R\\u0026B, hip-hop, and gangsta rap, playing artists ranging from the Isley Brothers to Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, and Tupac Shakur during frequent weekend gatherings. At around age eight, he witnessed Tupac Shakur and Dr. Dre filming the \"California Love\" music video near his home in Compton, an event that profoundly inspired his aspiration to pursue rapping. Early influences also included DMX and Nas, shaping his lyrical approach amid Compton's cultural landscape. Lamar did not pursue higher education, instead channeling his focus into music production and performance following high school.\n\n## Career\n\n### 2003–2008: Mixtape beginnings and local recognition\n\nLamar initially performed and recorded under the stage name **K.Dot**, beginning in his mid-teens while attending high school in Compton, California. In 2003, at age 16, he self-released his debut mixtape, *Youngest Head Nigga in Charge (Hub City Threat: Minor of the Year)*, through Konkrete Jungle Muzik, featuring 11 tracks of freestyles over beats from popular early-2000s hip-hop releases such as those by 50 Cent and Lil Wayne.  The project, limited to local distribution via CDs and early online platforms, introduced his raw delivery and Compton-centric narratives, earning initial buzz within the area's underground rap community.\n\nFollowing this, Lamar issued additional mixtapes under K.Dot, including *Training Day* in 2005 and *C4* in 2006, which expanded on themes of street life and personal ambition through remixes and original verses over established instrumentals. These releases circulated primarily in Southern California, fostering a dedicated local following through performances at Compton venues and connections with emerging artists. In 2005, he signed with Top Dawg Entertainment (TDE), an independent Carson-based label led by Anthony \"Top Dawg\" Tiffith, which provided structure for his output and collaborations within the West Coast scene.\n\nBy 2007–2008, Lamar's profile grew regionally via joint projects like *No Sleep 'Til NYC* with TDE labelmate Jay Rock, released December 24, 2007, blending East Coast-inspired freestyles with their shared Compton roots. This period solidified his reputation among peers for technical prowess and introspective lyricism, though broader commercial traction remained elusive amid a mixtape-saturated market dominated by established gangsta rap acts. Local acclaim stemmed from consistent output and word-of-mouth endorsements in Compton's competitive rap circuit, where survival hinged on authentic representation of neighborhood realities rather than polished production.\n\n### 2009–2011: Overly Dedicated and Section.80\n\nIn 2010, Kendrick Lamar released *Overly Dedicated*, his fifth mixtape and the first under his birth name, following earlier projects issued as K.Dot. The mixtape, distributed by Top Dawg Entertainment (TDE), became available for free download on September 14, 2010, with physical and digital sales options including iTunes. It featured 17 tracks emphasizing conscious hip hop themes, including critiques of gang culture in the song \"Ignorance Is Bliss,\" where Lamar explored the allure and consequences of street life. The project showcased collaborations with TDE affiliates and producers like Sounwave, building on Lamar's local Compton reputation and contributing to his growing underground following in West Coast rap circles.\n\n*Overly Dedicated* received positive attention within hip-hop communities for its lyrical depth and transition from Lamar's earlier gangsta rap influences toward introspective storytelling, earning retrospective acclaim as a pivotal step in his artistic maturation. User-driven platforms rated it highly for conscious hip hop, with an average score reflecting its role in elevating Lamar beyond regional mixtape circuits. The mixtape's release aligned with Lamar's involvement in TDE's Black Hippy collective, alongside Jay Rock, Ab-Soul, and ScHoolboy Q, fostering shared performances and buzz in Los Angeles independent scenes during late 2010.\n\nTransitioning to a studio album format, Lamar independently released *Section.80* on July 2, 2011, through TDE and his own Section.80 imprint, initially exclusive to iTunes before wider digital availability. The 15-track project, clocking in at 54 minutes, delved into social issues, personal ambition, and black empowerment, with standout tracks like \"HiiiPoWeR\" addressing systemic inequality and \"Rigamortis\" demonstrating rapid-fire delivery techniques. Produced primarily in-house by TDE associates including THC and Sounwave, it marked Lamar's debut full-length effort, self-funded and unmastered in parts to preserve raw energy.\n\n*Section.80* debuted at number 113 on the US Billboard 200 chart, signaling modest commercial entry while gaining critical praise for its thematic coherence and Lamar's narrative prowess in conscious rap. Retrospective analyses highlight its influence on Lamar's trajectory, with high rankings among 2011 hip-hop releases for blending Compton street tales with broader socio-political commentary, free from major-label constraints. The album's success, driven by word-of-mouth and digital streams, solidified Lamar's independent credibility and paved the way for major-label interest, though it remained outside mainstream pop-rap dominance at the time.\n\n### 2012–2013: good kid, m.A.A.d city breakthrough\n\n*good kid, m.A.A.d city* served as Kendrick Lamar's major-label debut studio album, released on October 22, 2012, through Top Dawg Entertainment, Aftermath Entertainment, and Interscope Records. The project functions as a concept album chronicling Lamar's adolescence in Compton, California, weaving a narrative of navigating gang culture, family pressures, and personal temptation through interconnected tracks and skits.\n\nThe album debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200 chart, with first-week sales of 242,000 copies, marking the highest debut week for a hip-hop album in 2012. It has since been certified triple platinum by the RIAA, reflecting over three million units sold in the United States. Promotion included lead singles \"Bitch, Don't Kill My Vibe,\" released in April 2012, and \"Swimming Pools (Drank),\" issued in July 2012, which achieved Lamar's first top-20 entry on the Billboard Hot 100 at number 17. Additional singles such as \"Poetic Justice\" and \"Backseat Freestyle\" further supported the release, blending introspective lyricism with mainstream appeal.\n\nCritics lauded the album for its cohesive storytelling and Lamar's vivid portrayal of Compton life, earning a Metascore of 91 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 35 reviews, indicating universal acclaim. Publications highlighted tracks like \"m.A.A.d city\" and \"Sing About Me, I'm Dying of Thirst\" for their raw authenticity and thematic depth, positioning the work as a modern hip-hop classic. The breakthrough propelled Lamar from underground mixtape recognition to mainstream stardom, evidenced by a world tour spanning May to August 2013 and five Grammy Award nominations at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year and Best Rap Album.\n\n### 2014–2016: To Pimp a Butterfly, Untitled Unmastered, and jazz-rap experimentation\n\nKendrick Lamar's third studio album, *To Pimp a Butterfly*, was released on March 15, 2015, through Top Dawg Entertainment, Aftermath Entertainment, and Interscope Records. The project marked a departure from conventional hip-hop structures, integrating dense jazz, funk, and soul elements into its soundscape. Recording sessions occurred primarily in 2014, with Lamar drawing from historical influences like Miles Davis, Herbie Hancock, and John Coltrane to explore themes of black identity, systemic oppression, and personal vulnerability. Key collaborators included jazz artists such as Thundercat, Kamasi Washington, Terrace Martin, Robert Glasper, and Ambrose Akinmusire, whose contributions shaped tracks like \"Wesley's Theory\" and \"King Kunta\" through live instrumentation and improvisational techniques.  \n\nThe album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart, selling 324,000 album-equivalent units in its first week, with 89% from pure sales. This performance reflected strong initial demand despite its experimental nature, which prioritized lyrical density and unconventional production over radio-friendly hooks. Critics noted the album's fusion of 1970s progressive soul, neo-soul, and free jazz as a deliberate evolution, challenging listeners with extended solos and spoken-word interludes that critiqued institutional power dynamics. Lamar's approach emphasized causal links between historical exploitation and contemporary struggles, rejecting simplified narratives in favor of multifaceted reasoning grounded in lived Compton experiences.  \n\nIn early 2016, Lamar surprise-released *untitled unmastered.* on March 4 via digital platforms, compiling eight rough demos from the *To Pimp a Butterfly* sessions spanning 2013 to 2016. Tracks like \"untitled 07 | 2014 - 2016\" featured raw, unpolished takes with guest appearances from Jay Rock and SZA, maintaining the jazz-rap aesthetic through go-go rhythms, spiritual jazz undertones, and free-form structures. The EP debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, underscoring Lamar's commercial leverage even for unfinished material.  \n\nThis period solidified Lamar's jazz-rap experimentation, blending hip-hop flows with modal jazz improvisation and ensemble playing to create a restless, innovation-driven sound. Productions avoided over-reliance on samples, favoring live band dynamics that mirrored jazz's emphasis on collective dialogue over individual dominance, as evidenced in collaborations yielding suffocatingly moody backdrops for introspective bars. Such methods prioritized artistic integrity over market predictability, with empirical success in chart dominance validating the causal efficacy of substantive content in sustaining audience engagement.\n\n### 2017–2019: DAMN., Black Panther: The Album, and commercial peak\n\n*DAMN.*, Lamar's fourth studio album, was released on April 14, 2017, through Top Dawg Entertainment, Aftermath Entertainment, and Interscope Records. It debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart, accumulating 603,000 album-equivalent units in its first week, the largest opening for any hip-hop album that year and surpassing the debut of Drake's *More Life*.  All 14 tracks from the album charted on the Billboard Hot 100 in the same week, a rare feat for a hip-hop project. The lead single \"HUMBLE.\" topped the Hot 100 for three non-consecutive weeks, becoming Lamar's first number-one hit as a lead artist.\n\nThe album's commercial performance continued strongly, with *DAMN.* generating over 15.6 million equivalent album units in the United States by aggregating sales and streams, making it the top-selling rap album of 2017 and the seventh highest-selling rap album of the 2010s. It sold more than 4.25 million pure copies across 19 countries, led by over 3 million units in the U.S. On April 16, 2018, *DAMN.* received the Pulitzer Prize for Music, recognizing it as \"a virtuosic song collection unified by its vernacular authenticity and rhythmic dynamism that offers affecting vignettes capturing the rapper's struggle regarding faith, family, and the vices and virtues of his adopted home in Compton, Calif.\"  This marked the first Pulitzer awarded to a work outside the classical and jazz genres since the music category's inception in 1943.\n\nIn February 2018, Lamar curated, executive produced, and contributed to *Black Panther: The Album*, the soundtrack for the Marvel film *Black Panther*, released on February 9 through the same labels. The project debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 with 154,000 equivalent units, the largest opening week for a soundtrack since 2016's *Suicide Squad*. It featured collaborations with artists including SZA, The Weeknd, and Travis Scott, with Lamar performing on seven of its 14 tracks. Singles such as \"All the Stars\" (with SZA, released January 4, 2018), \"King's Dead\" (with Jay Rock, Future, and James Blake), and \"Pray for Me\" (with The Weeknd) propelled the album's chart success, with six tracks entering the Billboard Hot 100. \n\nThis period represented Lamar's commercial zenith, with *DAMN.* topping the Billboard 200 year-end chart and *Black Panther: The Album* achieving over 138 million on-demand streams in its debut tracking week, the highest for any soundtrack at the time.  Lamar supported *DAMN.* with the DAMN. Tour alongside fellow Top Dawg artists, performing across North America and Europe from May 2017 to October 2018, contributing to his status as one of hip-hop's top-grossing acts during the era.\n\n### 2020–2023: Mr. Morale \\u0026 the Big Steppers and creative hiatus\n\nLamar co-founded pgLang with longtime collaborator Dave Free on March 5, 2020, establishing it as a multimedia service company focused on artist-driven projects across music, film, and visual media rather than a conventional record label.  This venture marked a shift toward broader creative endeavors during a self-imposed hiatus from solo album releases, which extended over five years from the 2017 drop of *DAMN.*.\n\nThe period emphasized personal withdrawal from public musical activity, with Lamar explaining in a 2020 interview that he intentionally steps back after major releases to recharge and avoid burnout from constant output expectations. Limited appearances included a feature on Baby Keem's \"Family Ties\" in October 2021, but no full projects emerged until 2022, reflecting a deliberate pause for introspection amid fame's pressures.\n\nOn May 13, 2022, Lamar released *Mr. Morale \\u0026 the Big Steppers*, his fifth studio album via pgLang and Top Dawg Entertainment, ending the extended break. It debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 with 295,000 album-equivalent units in its first week, including 202,000 in pure sales, and all 18 tracks charted on the Hot 100.  The album delves into introspective themes such as generational trauma, infidelity, sex addiction, therapy, and the burdens of celebrity, framed through Lamar's experiences with accountability and family dynamics.\n\nCertain lyrics, including references to misgendering family members and critiques of transgender figures like Caitlyn Jenner alongside uses of slurs, provoked debate over perceived insensitivity toward gender and sexuality issues, though Lamar positioned them as part of raw self-examination rather than endorsement of harm. He later revealed nearly shelving the project due to its vulnerability, fearing public backlash against its unfiltered personal disclosures.\n\nPost-release, Lamar supported the album with The Big Steppers Tour from July 2022 to March 2023, performing across North America and Europe alongside openers like Baby Keem and Denzel Curry. By mid-2023, he resumed a creative hiatus, prioritizing privacy and selective engagements over new music, with no solo releases until the following year. This pattern underscored his approach of cycling between intensive output and retreat to sustain artistic depth.\n\n### 2024–2025: Drake feud, GNX release, Super Bowl LIX performance, and Grand National Tour\n\nIn early 2024, tensions between Lamar and Drake escalated into a high-profile feud triggered by Lamar's verse on Future and Metro Boomin's \"Like That,\" released March 22, which rejected the notion of a \"big three\" in rap including Drake and J. Cole, asserting Lamar's dominance. The conflict intensified over the following weeks with a rapid exchange of diss tracks: Lamar released \"Euphoria\" on April 30, critiquing Drake's authenticity and personal life; Drake responded with \"Push Ups\" on April 19 and \"Taylor Made Freestyle\" on April 24, mocking Lamar's stature and career. On May 3, Drake dropped \"Family Matters,\" alleging Lamar physically abused fiancée Whitney Alford and engaged in infidelity; Lamar countered hours later with \"Meet the Grahams,\" accusing Drake of hiding a daughter and endangering his family, followed by \"Not Like Us\" on May 4, which labeled Drake a predator and became a cultural phenomenon, topping the Billboard Hot 100 for three weeks and certified diamond by October 2024.  Drake's final response, \"The Heart Part 6\" on May 5, denied the allegations but drew criticism for perceived weakness, with public sentiment and streaming metrics favoring Lamar, as \"Not Like Us\" amassed over 1 billion Spotify streams by mid-2025. The feud's accusations, including claims of domestic violence and pedophilic associations, remained unverified allegations exchanged in artistic rivalry, though Drake filed a defamation lawsuit against Universal Music Group in January 2025 over \"Not Like Us,\" which was dismissed by a federal judge in October 2025 for lack of evidence of malice.\n\nFollowing the feud's resolution in Lamar's favor, he surprise-released his sixth studio album, *GNX*, on November 22, 2024, via pgLang and Interscope Records, without prior singles or promotion, featuring 12 tracks with production from SZA, Jack Antonoff, and others, including a Tupac sample on the opener. The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, selling 231,000 equivalent units in its first week, and emphasized West Coast gangsta rap influences named after a 1980s Pontiac Grand National vehicle, with tracks like \"Squabble Up\" and \"Luther\" (featuring SZA) receiving critical acclaim for their aggressive lyricism and replay value. \n\nLamar headlined the Apple Music Super Bowl LIX halftime show on February 9, 2025, at Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, performing a 13-minute set of hits including \"Humble,\" \"DNA,\" and \"Not Like Us\" twice—once uncensored—alongside SZA for \"Luther\" and West Coast tributes featuring dancers in Uncle Sam attire and American flags, drawing 123.4 million viewers and praise for centering hip-hop's competitive edge without guest appearances from feud rivals.  The performance, directed by Dave Free, incorporated pyrotechnics and a stage design evoking Compton streets, solidifying Lamar's status as a premier live act.\n\nIn April 2025, Lamar announced the Grand National Tour with SZA as co-headliner, commencing April 19 in Minneapolis and spanning North America through June, Europe and UK in summer, Latin America in fall, and Australia in December, featuring opening acts like ScHoolboy Q and Doechii on select dates, with stadium shows at venues including Gillette Stadium on May 12 and Allegiant Stadium on May 31. By October 2025, the tour had grossed over $100 million from initial legs, blending *GNX* material with catalog staples and emphasizing high-production visuals tied to Lamar's thematic motifs of national identity and personal reckoning.\n\n## Artistry\n\n### Influences and stylistic evolution\n\nKendrick Lamar has frequently cited **Tupac Shakur** as his primary musical influence, praising Shakur's ability to blend street narratives with social commentary and emotional depth, which shaped Lamar's approach to conscious rap. In a 2012 interview, Lamar listed his top five rappers as Tupac Shakur, The Notorious B.I.G., Jay-Z, Nas, and Eminem, highlighting Shakur's versatility in addressing personal vulnerability alongside political themes as a model for his own lyricism. Other key figures include Nas for intricate storytelling and poetic introspection, Jay-Z for technical wordplay and entrepreneurial mindset in hip-hop, and West Coast pioneers like Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, and N.W.A. for foundational G-funk production and Compton-rooted authenticity, elements drawn from his father's record collection during Lamar's childhood.\n\nLamar's stylistic evolution reflects a progression from raw, narrative-driven street rap in his early mixtapes to experimental fusion genres in later works, adapting production techniques while maintaining dense lyrical content. His 2010 mixtape *Overly Dedicated* and 2011 album *Section.80* featured laid-back West Coast beats with conscious themes critiquing societal issues, echoing 1990s gangsta rap but emphasizing personal agency over glorification. The 2012 breakthrough *good kid, m.A.A.d city* advanced this with cinematic storytelling structured as a concept album depicting Compton life, incorporating soul samples and orchestral elements for a cohesive autobiographical arc.\n\nBy 2015's *To Pimp a Butterfly*, Lamar shifted toward jazz-rap experimentation, collaborating with artists like Thundercat and Kamasi Washington to integrate live instrumentation, funk grooves, and freeform structures, drawing from jazz's improvisational ethos to explore black identity and systemic inequality—earning acclaim for elevating hip-hop's musical complexity. This phase contrasted with the more streamlined trap and introspective minimalism of 2017's *DAMN.*, which prioritized radio accessibility through booming 808 bass and repetitive hooks while delving into duality of humility and hubris, marking a commercial pivot without sacrificing thematic depth. Subsequent releases like 2022's *Mr. Morale \\u0026 the Big Steppers* blended jazz remnants with punk-infused aggression and therapy-session vulnerability, reflecting personal growth amid fame's pressures, before 2024's *GNX* returned to high-energy West Coast bounce with aggressive flows, signaling a refinement of his foundational sound. Throughout, Lamar's evolution prioritizes conceptual cohesion over trend-chasing, evidenced by his consistent top-charting albums adapting to production shifts like digital trap while rooting in narrative innovation.\n\n### Musical style and production\n\nKendrick Lamar's musical style draws heavily from West Coast hip-hop traditions, incorporating dense, narrative-driven flows with rhythmic complexity, often employing back phrasing where syllables anticipate or lag behind the beat for emphasis and emotional cadence. His deliveries span a spectrum from syncopated precision to freer, jazz-inflected cadences, enabling versatile adaptation across tracks, as seen in the polyrhythmic layering on albums like *To Pimp a Butterfly*. This approach prioritizes lyrical density over strict metronomic adherence, fostering a conversational intensity that mirrors spoken-word poetry within rap structures.\n\nIn production, Lamar collaborates closely with a core group of producers from Top Dawg Entertainment, such as Sounwave (Mark Spears), who handled eight tracks on *DAMN.* in 2017, providing beats that balance trap minimalism with orchestral swells. Early works like *Section.80* (2011) feature sample-heavy, boom-bap foundations rooted in 1990s G-funk influences, evolving by *good kid, m.A.A.d city* (2012) into cinematic soundscapes with skits and regional basslines. Later projects incorporate live instrumentation—saxophones, bass, and drums from collaborators like Terrace Martin and Thundercat—yielding jazz-rap fusion on *To Pimp a Butterfly* (2015), where sessions emphasized organic jamming over quantized loops.\n\nLamar exerts directorial control without primary production credits, guiding sonic visions through iterative feedback, as in *DAMN.*'s trap-leaning tracks co-produced with Mike WiLL Made-It and James Blake, blending 808-driven aggression with subtle harmonic tension. This method yields genre-blending results, fusing hip-hop with funk, soul, and rock elements via layered percussion and unorthodox sampling, prioritizing thematic cohesion over commercial polish. Vocal production techniques include multi-tracked ad-libs and pitch-shifted effects to amplify introspective tones, evident in *Mr. Morale \\u0026 the Big Steppers* (2022), where sparse beats underscore raw delivery.\n\n### Lyrical themes and songwriting\n\nKendrick Lamar's lyrics frequently explore the harsh realities of life in Compton, California, including gang violence, poverty, drug addiction, and familial pressures, as depicted in narrative-driven tracks like those on *good kid, m.A.A.d city* (2012), where he recounts a day-in-the-life story of youthful temptation and survival. These themes stem from autobiographical elements, with Lamar emphasizing the cycle of immaturity leading to violence and the redemptive role of parental guidance and faith.\n\nSocial justice and racial identity form a core pillar, particularly in albums like *To Pimp a Butterfly* (2015), where Lamar critiques systemic racism, black self-sabotage, and institutional oppression through layered metaphors and historical allusions, challenging listeners to confront complicity in perpetuating inequality. In *DAMN.* (2017), he delves into duality—pride versus humility, sin versus salvation—interrogating personal flaws amid fame's temptations, often framing American black experience as a moral battleground. Later works, such as *Mr. Morale \\u0026 the Big Steppers* (2022), shift toward confessional introspection, addressing generational trauma, infidelity, sex addiction, and therapy's role in breaking cycles of abuse, with tracks like \"Mother I Sober\" unpacking inherited pain without romanticization.\n\nReligious and spiritual motifs recur prominently, influenced by Lamar's Christian upbringing and biblical literacy, evident in references to scripture across albums—from cries of suffering echoing Christ's lament in *DAMN.*'s \"GOD.\" to parables of redemption in *good kid, m.A.A.d city*'s closing prayer-like structure. These elements underscore themes of divine judgment, moral wrestling, and spiritual accountability, contrasting mainstream hip-hop's materialism with calls for ethical rigor, though some analyses note potential over-reliance on Old Testament wrath over New Testament grace.\n\nLamar's songwriting employs meticulous narrative cohesion, crafting concept albums as extended stories with skits, recurring motifs, and chronological progression to immerse listeners in causal sequences of choices and consequences, as in *good kid, m.A.A.d city*'s plot mirroring films like *Boyz n the Hood*. He prioritizes authenticity from lived experience, starting with vague lyrical sketches adjusted to beats via trial-and-error, emphasizing one focused message per song for disciplined impact and \"stickiness\" through repetition in hooks. Techniques include lean phrasing to heighten precision, intricate multis and internal rhymes for density, and unapologetic honesty to process emotions, often drawing from obsession and collaboration control rather than external formulas. This approach yields lyrics that function as moral parables, blending street realism with philosophical depth to provoke self-examination.\n\n### Vocal technique and delivery\n\nKendrick Lamar's vocal delivery is marked by exceptional versatility, allowing seamless transitions between rapid-fire rap cadences and melodic phrasing, often within a single track. He frequently employs breath control to sustain long, dense verses without interruption, as demonstrated in songs like \"Sing About Me, I'm Dying of Thirst\" from *good kid, m.A.A.d city* (2012), where extended storytelling requires precise diaphragmatic support. This technique enables rhythmic precision over complex beats influenced by jazz, funk, and hip-hop, where he aligns flows to non-standard meters for metrical tension and emotional depth.\n\nHis rap flow incorporates syncopation, 16th-note subdivisions, and triplets, with deliberate stress shifts to evade repetitive patterns and enhance narrative drive. In \"Wesley's Theory\" from *To Pimp a Butterfly* (2015), Lamar shifts from a laid-back West Coast cadence to heightened intensity, mirroring character evolution through vocal modulation. Advanced internal rhyming schemes, such as multisyllabic assonance and consonance chains, further distinguish his technique, as analyzed in \"The Heart Part 5\" (2022), where layered phonetics create density without sacrificing intelligibility.\n\nLamar's voice spans a functional range from approximately A#2 to D#4 in sung elements, extending higher in emphatic rap deliveries up to G#5, allowing for tonal contrast between introspective lows and aggressive highs.  He draws on jazz-inspired inflections for expressive variance, modulating timbre— from nasally highs to gravelly depths—to embody multiple personas, as in tracks mimicking historical figures or internal dialogues. This approach, evident in live performances like his 13-minute set at Super Bowl LIX on February 9, 2025, underscores stamina and adaptability without reliance on a hype man.\n\n## Feuds and rivalries\n\n### Early diss tracks and industry tensions\n\nIn August 2013, Kendrick Lamar delivered a provocative guest verse on Big Sean's track \"Control,\" produced by No I.D. and featuring Jay Electronica, which ignited widespread industry tensions by directly challenging several prominent rappers. Released on August 12, 2013, Lamar's two-minute segment asserted dominance in hip-hop, naming J. Cole, Big KRIT, Wale, Pusha T, Meek Mill, A$AP Rocky, Drake, Tyler, the Creator, and Big Sean himself as rivals he aimed to surpass, rapping lines such as \"I'm Makaveli's offspring, I'm the king of New York / King of the Coast, one hand, I juggle 'em both.\" Lamar framed the verse as a call for competition to elevate the genre, stating in subsequent interviews that it stemmed from a desire to provoke peers into sharper work rather than personal animosity.\n\nThe verse provoked immediate backlash, particularly from East Coast artists sensitive to Lamar's self-proclaimed \"King of New York\" title—a nod historically tied to The Notorious B.I.G.—leading to responses from Joey Bada$$, who dismissed Lamar's Compton roots in a tweet, and others like Papoose, who released freestyles countering the claims. Drake, targeted explicitly, addressed it indirectly on his September 2013 album *Nothing Was the Same* via tracks like \"The Language,\" with lyrics interpreted as retorts: \"And that's the thing about this shit, you niggas get on a song and dissin' / And by the time you get your shit together, I'm onto the next one.\" Drake later clarified in interviews that he viewed Lamar's bars as competitive banter, not a declaration of war, though TDE co-founder Punch later attributed the enduring Drake-Lamar friction to this moment, noting it shifted their prior collaborative rapport—evident in Lamar's 2011 feature on Drake's \"Buried Alive Interlude\"—into simmering rivalry.\n\nWhile J. Cole responded constructively by releasing \"Let Nas Down\" in December 2013 and later collaborating with Lamar, the episode highlighted broader industry fault lines over regional authenticity and commercial dominance, with Lamar's West Coast perspective clashing against established East and Toronto figures. No full diss tracks emerged from Lamar pre-2014 beyond this verse, but it established a pattern of lyrical provocation that contrasted his introspective early mixtapes like *Section.80* (2011), fostering perceptions of him as an assertive outsider challenging hip-hop's hierarchy. These tensions, though not escalating to outright feuds until later, underscored Lamar's early career strategy of using bars to assert Compton's relevance amid a Drake-led wave of melodic, hit-driven rap.\n\n### 2024 Drake feud: Origins, escalation, and resolution\n\nThe feud between Kendrick Lamar and Drake escalated publicly in 2024, building on years of subtle tensions rooted in competitive comparisons within hip-hop, including Lamar's 2013 track \"Control,\" where he named Drake among peers he aimed to surpass. The immediate trigger occurred on March 22, 2024, when Lamar featured on Future and Metro Boomin's \"Like That,\" rejecting Drake and J. Cole's self-proclaimed \"big three\" status from Drake's October 2023 collaboration \"First Person Shooter,\" with Lamar declaring, \"Motherf**k the big three, n***a, it's just big me.\"  This verse dismissed notions of rap supremacy shared between the artists, intensifying longstanding rivalries over authenticity, commercial dominance, and cultural representation.\n\nDrake responded on April 13, 2024, with \"Push Ups,\" mocking Lamar's stature, shoe deal, and pop collaborations while targeting others like Rick Ross and The Weeknd. He followed on April 19 with \"Taylor Made Freestyle,\" incorporating AI-generated voices of Tupac Shakur and Snoop Dogg criticizing Lamar, but withdrew it hours later amid backlash and a cease-and-desist from Tupac's estate.  Lamar retaliated on April 30 with the seven-minute \"Euphoria,\" dissecting Drake's persona, parenting, and alleged ghostwriting over four parts, accusing him of inauthenticity and cultural appropriation. On May 3, Lamar released \"6:16 in LA,\" implying disloyalty within Drake's OVO camp. The exchange peaked on May 4, when Drake dropped \"Family Matters,\" alleging Lamar's partner Whitney Alford suffered abuse and infidelity; Lamar countered within an hour with \"Meet the Grahams,\" addressing Drake's family directly, claiming he hid a daughter and exhibited predatory behavior toward younger women.  Lamar then released \"Not Like Us\" that evening, framing Drake as a \"colonizer\" in hip-hop and reiterating predator accusations, with the track surging to number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and amassing over one billion Spotify streams. \n\nDrake's May 5 response, \"The Heart Part 6,\" denied Lamar's allegations, claiming he leaked false pedophilia rumors via intermediaries to provoke him, but it drew criticism for evasive lyrics and failed to match the cultural impact of Lamar's output.  Lamar performed \"Not Like Us\" five times at his June 19, 2024, Juneteenth concert in Inglewood, California, attended by over 120,000 fans, solidifying its anthem status and amplifying anti-Drake sentiment in hip-hop circles. The feud subsided without direct reconciliation, though Drake pursued legal action in November 2024, filing a pre-action petition against Universal Music Group alleging artificial inflation of \"Not Like Us\" streams via payola and bots, seeking an injunction against its promotion. Lamar's tracks dominated metrics, with \"Not Like Us\" winning five Grammys in 2025, including Record and Song of the Year, while public and critical consensus, including from figures like Rick Rubin, viewed Lamar as the victor for sharper lyricism and thematic depth over Drake's responses. \n\n## Public image\n\n### Media portrayal and cultural icon status\n\nMedia outlets have portrayed Kendrick Lamar as a preeminent voice in contemporary hip-hop, emphasizing his introspective lyricism and engagement with societal issues including racism, police brutality, and black identity formation. This depiction gained prominence following the release of albums like *good kid, m.A.A.d city* in 2012 and *To Pimp a Butterfly* in 2015, where reviewers lauded his narrative storytelling drawn from Compton experiences as a form of cultural critique. His 2018 Pulitzer Prize win for *DAMN.*, the first awarded to a non-jazz or classical musician, further entrenched this image, with *The New York Times* describing it as a transformative moment challenging traditional boundaries in American music awards.\n\nLamar's status as a cultural icon manifests in his broad influence across music, politics, and social discourse, evidenced by 22 Grammy Awards as of 2025, including recent wins for \"Not Like Us\" in categories like Song of the Year. Performances such as the Super Bowl LIX halftime show on February 9, 2025, drew interpretations as encoded political statements on American divisions, blending rap with visual symbolism to engage millions. Contemporaries and analysts credit him with elevating hip-hop's legitimacy in elite circles while inspiring activism, though his appeal stems partly from aligning with institutional preferences for \"conscious\" rap amid commercial dominance.\n\nCritics of this portrayal argue that media amplification, particularly from outlets favoring sociopolitical narratives, overstates Lamar's technical innovations in production and vocal delivery relative to peers, positioning him as hip-hop's moral arbiter despite inconsistent output quality. Such hype, evident in early post-*Section.80* coverage, has led to accusations of manufactured elevation, where substantive artistic risks are secondary to fitting a progressive archetype in biased journalistic ecosystems. Nonetheless, empirical metrics like album sales exceeding 20 million units worldwide and sustained chart dominance underscore a genuine, if selectively amplified, cultural resonance.\n\n### Criticisms of persona and output\n\nKendrick Lamar has faced accusations of hypocrisy in his public persona, particularly for adopting a moralistic stance in his lyrics and interviews while associating with individuals accused of serious misconduct. For instance, critics highlighted the inconsistency of Lamar performing alongside Dr. Dre—who has faced domestic abuse allegations dating back to the 1990s—at high-profile events, including the 2025 Super Bowl halftime show where Lamar debuted a track criticizing predatory behavior, despite Dre's history. Similarly, in May 2025, Lamar drew backlash for collaborating with Playboi Carti, whose lyrics and persona have been linked to themes of absentee fatherhood and irresponsibility, shortly after Lamar's diss tracks against Drake accused the latter of being a \"deadbeat\" dad and cultural opportunist.  Lamar himself addressed personal contradictions in tracks like \"The Blacker the Berry\" from *To Pimp a Butterfly* (2015), rapping \"I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015,\" which some interpret as self-awareness but others as an excuse for inconsistent moralizing. \n\nCritics have also targeted Lamar's output for being overrated, arguing that his acclaim stems more from media hype and cultural signaling than technical innovation or consistent quality. Former Roc-A-Fella Records affiliate Oschino Vazquez labeled Lamar \"overrated\" in a May 2024 interview, claiming his introspective style lacks the gritty authenticity of earlier hip-hop while relying on dense, abstract narratives that prioritize prestige over accessibility.  Online discussions, including on Reddit, echo this by dismissing albums like *To Pimp a Butterfly* (2015) as the \"most overrated in hip-hop history,\" citing repetitive structures, esoteric jazz influences, and lyrics that demand excessive interpretation without delivering broad appeal or replay value. Lamar's vocal delivery and production have been faulted for prioritizing preachiness over melody; for example, Fox News commentator Geraldo Rivera in 2015 decried Lamar's BET Awards performance and lyrics as promoting negativity and gang culture under a veneer of social commentary, arguing they undermine societal progress.\n\nFurther scrutiny of Lamar's lyrical themes reveals complaints of selective moralism, where he critiques systemic issues like racism and hypocrisy but glosses over personal or communal failings in Compton's hip-hop scene. In the 2024 feud with Drake, Lamar's accusations of cultural inauthenticity were undermined by detractors pointing to his own admitted contradictions, such as glorifying street violence in early work while later condemning it. Some analysts, like Freddie deBoer in a February 2025 Substack essay, portray Lamar as more performative than substantive in his politics, using activism as aesthetic rather than effecting concrete change, which aligns with broader skepticism of his \"conscious\" rap persona amid commercial successes tied to mainstream validation. Despite these points, defenders attribute criticisms to resistance against Lamar's challenge to hip-hop's materialism, though empirical sales data—such as *DAMN.* (2017) debuting at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 with 603,000 equivalent units—suggests his output resonates widely despite detractors.\n\n## Personal life\n\n### Family and relationships\n\nKendrick Lamar Duckworth was born on June 17, 1987, in Compton, California, to parents Kenny Duckworth and Paula Oliver, who had relocated from Chicago three years earlier to escape the city's gang violence. His father, originally from Chicago's South Side, had been involved with the Gangster Disciples gang during his youth there. Lamar has referenced his parents' influence in his music, portraying his upbringing amid Compton's challenges while crediting their guidance for steering him away from local gang affiliations.\n\nLamar has two younger brothers and one younger sister, Kayla Duckworth, with whom he maintains a close relationship, including attending her college graduation in 2023.\n\nLamar has been in a long-term relationship with Whitney Alford since their time as teenagers at Compton's Centennial High School. The couple became engaged in 2015, though they have not publicly confirmed a marriage. They share two children: a daughter, Uzi, born on July 26, 2019, and a son, Enoch, born in 2022. Lamar has kept details of his family life private, occasionally alluding to fatherhood's responsibilities in his lyrics, such as on the 2022 album *Mr. Morale \\u0026 the Big Steppers*.\n\n### Religious beliefs and personal struggles\n\nLamar has publicly identified as a Christian, attributing his deliverance from gang violence and poverty in Compton to divine intervention. In a 2015 interview, he described his faith as having been tested through personal trials, requiring him to affirm God's reality internally amid life's challenges. His lyrics often invoke Christian motifs of sin, repentance, and redemption, as in the introduction to his 2012 album *good kid, m.A.A.d city*, where he prays as a sinner seeking forgiveness.\n\nA pivotal spiritual experience occurred in his youth, following the murder of a close friend, when Lamar was baptized in the parking lot of a Food 4 Less supermarket by the grandmother of another friend present at the scene. He has referenced this unconventional immersion as a moment of salvation, symbolizing a break from street life, though he later noted in 2015 that a reaffirmation of his commitment happened approximately three to four years prior. This event underscores his early entanglement of faith with the violence of Compton, where he navigated gang affiliations despite his family's religious influence.\n\nLamar's personal struggles frequently intersect with his religious convictions, manifesting as internal conflicts over pride, lust, and moral failings amid rising fame. His 2017 album *DAMN.* delves into these tensions, portraying a wrestle with divine judgment and humility versus self-aggrandizement, influenced by biblical themes but complicated by his critique that many churches avoid preaching God's disciplinary wrath. He has expressed fear of denying God despite worldly temptations, viewing faith as a bulwark against the \"madness\" of his environment and inner demons. These struggles reflect a faith marked by ongoing self-scrutiny rather than static piety, evident in his admissions of sin-stained devotion requiring constant repentance.\n\n## Other ventures\n\n### Entrepreneurship and pgLang\n\nIn March 2020, Kendrick Lamar co-founded pgLang, a multidisciplinary creative services company, alongside longtime collaborator Dave Free, with the aim of establishing a \"new kind of company\" tailored to the creator economy through artist-friendly, multilingual operations focused on music, film, and visual content production. The venture initially handled internal projects for Lamar, including music videos, live performances, and brand collaborations, while extending services to external clients in advertising and multimedia.\n\npgLang has produced high-profile work such as Lamar's music videos and the staging for his Grand National Tour in 2025, alongside commercials and content for brands, emphasizing creative direction and content creation without traditional agency constraints. In July 2025, the company expanded with Project 3, a full-service agency division targeting business clients for strategic creative services, including visual production and campaign development, to broaden its commercial footprint.\n\nThe firm's approach prioritizes autonomy for creators, as articulated by Free in interviews, positioning pgLang as an independent entity amid industry consolidation, and it received recognition as one of Fast Company's Most Innovative Companies in 2025 for its influence in tech-media intersections. Lamar's involvement reflects a shift toward entrepreneurial oversight of his artistic output, though pgLang operates separately from his primary music label affiliations under Interscope and Top Dawg Entertainment. No public details indicate significant personal investments by Lamar outside pgLang, with the company serving as his principal business endeavor beyond recording and touring.\n\n### Philanthropy efforts\n\nKendrick Lamar has directed philanthropic efforts primarily toward his hometown of Compton, California, emphasizing youth development and community support. In collaboration with pgLang and Free Lunch, he donated $200,000 to 20 Los Angeles-based charities and initiatives focused on youth empowerment, mental health, and community rebuilding following his June 19, 2024, \"Pop Out\" concert at the Kia Forum. These contributions targeted organizations addressing local challenges such as homelessness and education gaps, reflecting a pattern of reinvesting concert proceeds into regional needs.\n\nEarlier initiatives included substantial donations to the Compton Unified School District for music, sports, and after-school programs, totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars aimed at providing alternatives to street life for at-risk youth. In 2014, Lamar organized a five-stop international tour with proceeds benefiting Habitat for Humanity and Compton community projects, alongside contributions to the American Red Cross for disaster relief. He has also supported shelters for the homeless and victims of domestic violence through direct funding and personal involvement.\n\nIn January 2025, Lamar launched the \"Halftime Collection\" apparel line, directing all proceeds to the American Red Cross to aid victims of California wildfires, extending his giving beyond Compton to broader disaster response. Participation in events like the 2023 Christmas in Compton toy giveaway further underscores his ongoing commitment to holiday aid for local families, though specific donation amounts for such appearances remain undisclosed in public records. These efforts, often channeled quietly without extensive publicity, prioritize tangible community outcomes over high-profile announcements.\n\n### Activism involvement and outcomes\n\nLamar's engagement in activism centers on using his platform to highlight racial injustice and community violence through lyrics and select public actions, rather than organized campaigning. His 2015 single \"Alright,\" from the album *To Pimp a Butterfly*, emerged as a rallying cry against police brutality, with protesters chanting its chorus—\"We gon' be alright\"—during Black Lives Matter demonstrations following events like the 2014 death of Michael Brown in Ferguson and subsequent unrest. The song's optimistic refrain amid critiques of systemic oppression provided a counterpoint to despair, influencing protest culture by framing resilience as a form of resistance, though Lamar himself emphasized personal agency over collective mobilization in interviews.\n\nIn response to broader social tensions, Lamar publicly supported NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick's 2016 national anthem protests against racial inequality, aligning with athletes challenging institutional authority despite backlash from figures like then-President Donald Trump. He participated in a June 2020 peace walk in Compton amid heightened Black Lives Matter activity following George Floyd's death, aiming to promote non-violence in his hometown amid gang rivalries and unrest. During the February 2025 Super Bowl LIX halftime show, Lamar incorporated themes of racial history and political division, including segregated seating arrangements for performers to evoke civil rights-era imagery, sparking national discussions on cultural resistance and media narratives around race.\n\nOutcomes of these efforts remain primarily cultural rather than legislative, with \"Alright\" sustaining its role in protests through 2020 and beyond, fostering awareness of police-community tensions without documented shifts in policy or reduced violence metrics attributable directly to Lamar's input. His Super Bowl performance prompted debates on celebrity influence in civic discourse, though it drew criticism for prioritizing spectacle over substantive reform advocacy. Analyses attribute limited tangible results to Lamar's focus on introspective storytelling over explicit calls to action, contrasting with more direct activist figures, yet his work has elevated hip-hop's capacity to sustain public attention on racial inequities.\n\n## Achievements and impact\n\n### Awards, sales, and records\n\nKendrick Lamar has amassed 22 Grammy Awards as of the 67th Annual Grammy Awards in 2025, tying him for the third-most wins by a rapper in Grammy history. At the 2025 ceremony, his single \"Not Like Us\" secured five wins, including Record of the Year and Song of the Year, out of seven nominations. He holds the record for the most wins in BET Hip Hop Awards history and received 10 nominations at the 2025 BET Awards. Lamar also earned 10 nominations at the 2025 American Music Awards, leading all artists.\n\nIn 2018, Lamar became the first hip-hop artist to win the Pulitzer Prize for Music for his album *DAMN.*, recognized for its vernacular cohesion and rhythmic dynamism addressing contemporary African-American life. The album additionally won five Grammy Awards, including Best Rap Album.\n\nLamar's discography has generated over 80 million equivalent album units worldwide. *DAMN.* accounts for 17.2 million units, his highest-selling album. His 2024 release *GNX* surpassed 2 million equivalent units in 2025, marking the first hip-hop album to achieve this milestone that year.\n\nThe RIAA has certified several of Lamar's works, reflecting U.S. sales and streaming performance:\n\n| Title                  | Certification          | Date              |\n|------------------------|------------------------|-------------------|\n| Section.80 (album)     | Gold (500,000 units)  | April 14, 2017   |\n| To Pimp a Butterfly (album) | Platinum (1,000,000 units) | February 1, 2016 |\n| good kid, m.A.A.d city (album) | Multi-Platinum (certified June 8, 2018) | June 8, 2018     |\n| HUMBLE. (single)       | 20× Platinum (2× Diamond) | February 10, 2025|\n\n\"HUMBLE.\" holds the distinction of being the highest-certified rap single in RIAA history with 20 million units.\n\nAmong records, Lamar's 2025 Grand National Tour with SZA grossed the highest for any co-headlining tour in history. \"Not Like Us\" set benchmarks as the fastest rap song to 100 million streams and the most-streamed rap track in a single day. His album *DAMN.* was the fifth best-selling album of 2017 and the most successful rap album that year with 15.6 million equivalent album sales.\n\n### Commercial and critical reception\n\nKendrick Lamar's recordings have garnered substantial commercial success, with his catalog exceeding 80 million equivalent album units sold worldwide as of 2023. His breakthrough album *good kid, m.A.A.d city* (2012) debuted at number two on the Billboard 200, moving 242,000 units in its first week. Follow-up releases dominated charts more decisively: *To Pimp a Butterfly* (2015) entered at number one with 324,000 first-week units, while *DAMN.* (2017) achieved the largest opening week of his career at 603,000 units, also topping the Billboard 200. *DAMN.* further certified all 14 tracks platinum by the RIAA, denoting 1 million units each in the U.S., and the album itself reached multi-platinum status. Recent efforts like *GNX* (2024) debuted at number one with 319,000 equivalent units, bolstered by 161 million on-demand streams in its launch week.\n\nStreaming metrics underscore sustained popularity, with Lamar surpassing 50 billion total plays on Spotify by August 2025; lead singles like \"HUMBLE.\" from *DAMN.* alone amassed nearly 4 billion streams. Tracks such as \"Not Like Us\" (2024) set records for daily streams among rap songs, contributing to heightened visibility amid high-profile feuds.\n\nCritically, Lamar's output consistently ranks among hip-hop's elite, with aggregated Metacritic scores placing *To Pimp a Butterfly* at 96/100—the highest for any rap album—and *DAMN.* at 95/100. His discography averages the highest ratings among major rappers, reflecting praise for lyrical depth, thematic ambition, and production innovation across projects like *good kid, m.A.A.d city* (91/100) and *Mr. Morale \\u0026 the Big Steppers* (86/100). Reviewers often highlight his narrative storytelling and social commentary, though later works faced occasional critique for introspection bordering on self-indulgence. *GNX* (2024) earned a 91/100, cementing his streak of universally positive reception. This acclaim positions Lamar as a benchmark for artistic excellence in contemporary rap, per aggregated critic analyses.\n\n### Legacy and influence on hip-hop\n\nKendrick Lamar's 2017 album *DAMN.* received the Pulitzer Prize for Music on April 16, 2018, making him the first rapper and the first non-jazz or classical artist to win the award since its expansion to popular music genres in 1943. This recognition highlighted hip-hop's capacity for literary depth and social critique, as the Pulitzer committee praised Lamar's \"unflinching song cycle\" for articulating the complexities of African American life in Compton. The decision reflected a shift in institutional validation, with jurors noting the genre's evolving cultural status, though it also sparked debate on whether such awards dilute rap's street authenticity or affirm its artistic merit.\n\nLamar's influence extends to revitalizing competitive lyricism in hip-hop, exemplified by his September 2013 verse on Big Sean's \"Control,\" where he challenged peers like Drake and J. Cole by name, prompting a wave of response tracks and elevating technical standards across the genre. This moment fostered a renewed emphasis on skill-based rivalry, contrasting with trends toward melodic trap dominance, and influenced artists to prioritize bars and storytelling over commercial formulas. His approach—blending personal vulnerability, historical references, and moral introspection—has been credited with inspiring a cohort of rappers, including J. Cole and Joey Bada$$, to explore conscious themes amid mainstream superficiality.\n\nIn 2024, Lamar's feud with Drake, ignited by his verse on Future and Metro Boomin's \"Like That\" released March 22, further demonstrated his role in enforcing accountability, as his diss tracks critiqued cultural appropriation and commercial excess, reshaping discourse on authenticity and pushing the genre toward substantive confrontation over gimmicks. Overall, Lamar's legacy lies in bridging hip-hop's gangsta roots with intellectual rigor, contributing to its acceptance as a vehicle for societal reflection while maintaining commercial viability, though critics argue his impact coexists with broader industry dynamics rather than single-handedly \"saving\" the form.\n\n## Discography\n\n### Studio albums\n\n**Section.80** (2011) marked Kendrick Lamar's independent debut studio album, released on July 2, 2011, through Top Dawg Entertainment. It debuted at number 113 on the US Billboard 200 chart, with first-week sales of 5,400 copies driven entirely by digital downloads. By October 2012, cumulative sales reached 78,000 units in the US, and the album was later certified gold by the RIAA in 2017 for 500,000 equivalent units sold. Critics praised its lyrical depth and conscious hip-hop themes, positioning it as a breakthrough that showcased Lamar's storytelling from Compton's socio-economic struggles.\n\n**good kid, m.A.A.d city** (2012), Lamar's major-label debut, was released on October 22, 2012, via Top Dawg, Aftermath, and Interscope Records. The album debuted at number two on the Billboard 200, selling 242,000 copies in its first week—the highest first-week sales for a hip-hop album in 2012—and has since accumulated over 3 million units in the US. It spent 520 weeks on the Billboard 200 by 2022, marking 10 consecutive years on the chart and making it the longest-charting hip-hop studio album in Billboard history. The concept album narrates Lamar's youth in Compton, emphasizing themes of gang violence, family, and moral dilemmas, with production from Dr. Dre and others contributing to its critical acclaim for narrative cohesion.\n\n**To Pimp a Butterfly** (2015), released on March 15, 2015, debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 with 324,000 album-equivalent units in its first week, becoming Lamar's first chart-topping album. It has sold over 1 million copies in the US and earned a Grammy Award for Best Rap Album in 2016. Blending jazz, funk, and hip-hop, the album addresses systemic racism, black identity, and personal fame, with collaborations including Thundercat and George Clinton; its dense, politically charged lyrics drew widespread praise for intellectual rigor, though initial commercial expectations were tempered by its experimental sound.\n\n**DAMN.** (2017), Lamar's fourth studio album, arrived on April 14, 2017, debuting at number one on the Billboard 200 with 603,000 equivalent units in its first week. Certified triple platinum by the RIAA, it has sold over 3 million units in the US and 4.25 million globally, making it Lamar's best-selling album. Every track achieved RIAA platinum certification by 2018, driven by hits like \"HUMBLE.\" and \"DNA.,\" which explored faith, vulnerability, and American duality; the album's introspective style and Mike WiLL Made-It production balanced accessibility with depth, earning universal acclaim for its thematic duality presented in standard and inverted tracklist editions.\n\n**Mr. Morale \\u0026 the Big Steppers** (2022) was released on May 13, 2022, topping the Billboard 200 in its debut week with 295,500 equivalent units, the largest opening week for a rap album that year. It features introspective content on therapy, accountability, and family dynamics, with guest appearances from Baby Keem and Kodak Black; while critically divisive for its personal revelations and uneven pacing, it solidified Lamar's reputation for evolving beyond street narratives toward psychological self-examination.\n\n**GNX** (2024), Lamar's sixth studio album, was surprise-released on November 22, 2024, via pgLang and Interscope, emphasizing West Coast rap revival with aggressive flows and production from Sounwave and Jack Antonoff. It debuted strongly on charts, reflecting Lamar's post-hiatus momentum amid his feud with Drake, though specific sales figures underscore its role in maintaining commercial dominance through streaming and vinyl demand.\n\n### Mixtapes and EPs\n\nKendrick Lamar began his recording career releasing mixtapes as K.Dot, reflecting the gangsta rap influences prevalent in early 2000s Compton hip-hop. His debut mixtape, *Y.H.N.I.C. (Hub City Threat: Minor of the Year)*, dropped in 2003 when he was 16, featuring freestyles and tracks emulating West Coast gangsta style over popular beats.\n\nSubsequent early mixtapes included *Training Day* in 2005, inspired by the film of the same name and showcasing raw storytelling about street life, and the collaborative *No Sleep 'Til NYC* with Jay Rock in 2007, which highlighted his affiliation with Top Dawg Entertainment (TDE) and ambitions beyond local scenes.\n\n| Title | Artist | Type | Release Date | Label |\n|-------|--------|------|--------------|-------|\n| Y.H.N.I.C. (Hub City Threat: Minor of the Year) | K.Dot | Mixtape | 2003 | Konkrete Jungle Muzik |\n| Training Day | K.Dot | Mixtape | 2005 | Independent |\n| No Sleep 'Til NYC | K.Dot \\u0026 Jay Rock | Mixtape | 2007 | Independent |\n| Kendrick Lamar EP | Kendrick Lamar | EP | December 31, 2009 | Top Dawg Entertainment |\n| Overly Dedicated | Kendrick Lamar | Mixtape | September 14, 2010 | Top Dawg Entertainment |\n| untitled unmastered. | Kendrick Lamar | EP | March 4, 2016 | Top Dawg Entertainment / Aftermath / Interscope |\n\n*Overly Dedicated*, his final mixtape under TDE's free distribution model, marked a pivot toward introspective lyricism amid Compton's vices, with tracks like \"Ignorance Is Bliss\" juxtaposing glorification of street crime against its consequences, earning praise for bridging underground appeal and broader recognition. The project solidified Lamar's reputation, attracting attention from artists like J. Cole and influencing his signing to Interscope.\n\nThe 2016 EP *untitled unmastered.* comprises eight unpolished demos from *To Pimp a Butterfly* sessions, released unexpectedly during a Comedy Central roast appearance where Lamar performed \"Untitled 07,\" demonstrating his improvisational prowess and providing insight into his creative process without commercial intent. Featuring collaborations with TDE affiliates like Jay Rock and SZA, it debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, selling over 178,000 copies in its first week despite its raw form.\n\n### Singles and collaborations\n\nKendrick Lamar's singles have frequently achieved high positions on the Billboard Hot 100, with several reaching number one. His debut major-label single, \"Swimming Pools (Drank)\" from the album *good kid, m.A.A.d city*, was released on July 31, 2012, and peaked at number 17 after debuting at number 100, spending 29 weeks on the chart. Follow-up singles from the same album, \"Bitch, Don't Kill My Vibe\" released in 2013 and peaking at number 32, and \"Poetic Justice\" featuring Drake peaking at number 26, contributed to its commercial momentum.\n\nFrom *To Pimp a Butterfly* (2015), \"i\" peaked at number 39 on the Hot 100, while \"Alright\" reached number 81 but gained enduring cultural significance as an anthem for the Black Lives Matter movement. The *DAMN.* era produced Lamar's first number-one single as lead artist, \"HUMBLE.\", released March 30, 2017, which topped the Hot 100 for one week. Other tracks from *DAMN.* included \"LOYALTY.\" featuring Rihanna peaking at number 14 and \"LOVE.\" featuring Zacari at number 13.\n\nThe *Black Panther* soundtrack featured \"All the Stars\" with SZA, released in 2018 and peaking at number 7. From *Mr. Morale \\u0026 the Big Steppers* (2022), \"N95\" peaked at number 25. In 2024, Lamar released the diss track \"Not Like Us\" amid his feud with Drake, which debuted at number one on the Hot 100 for three weeks. Singles from *GNX* (2024) included \"Luther\" featuring SZA, which reached number one on the Hot 100 and held the position for at least nine consecutive weeks by April 2025, and \"TV Off\" featuring Lefty Gunplay, which topped the Rhythmic Airplay chart.\n\nAs a featured artist, Lamar has contributed to several chart-topping tracks. His verse on Taylor Swift's \"Bad Blood (Remix)\", released in 2015, propelled it to number one on the Hot 100. The 2013 verse on Big Sean's \"Control\" alongside Jay Electronica became a cultural milestone, challenging numerous contemporaries and reshaping industry dynamics. In 2024, his appearance on Future and Metro Boomin's \"Like That\" debuted at number one, escalating the Lamar-Drake rivalry. Other notable collaborations include verses on tracks by Jhené Aiko, Meek Mill, and Jay Rock, showcasing his versatility across hip-hop subgenres.\n\n## Filmography and media appearances\n\n### Acting roles\n\nKendrick Lamar made his acting debut in the Starz crime drama series *Power*, portraying Laces, a fast-talking homeless drug addict, in the fifth-season episode \"Happy Birthday,\" which originally aired on July 29, 2018. In the episode, his character engages in a tense interaction with Kanan Stark (played by Curtis \"50 Cent\" Jackson), providing philosophical commentary amid a drug-fueled assistance in a hit. The role required Lamar to embody a vulnerable, erratic figure, drawing on extended preparation; executive producer 50 Cent noted the cameo had been in development for two years, with Lamar shadowing the set to study performances.\n\nCritics and observers praised the guest appearance for its authenticity and emotional depth, highlighting Lamar's ability to convey desperation and street wisdom without relying on his musical persona. The performance lasted several minutes but stood out for its raw intensity, marking a rare foray into scripted acting beyond music videos or self-portrayals. As of 2025, this remains Lamar's sole credited role as a fictional character in a narrative television production.\n\n### Soundtrack contributions\n\nLamar curated and executive produced *Black Panther: The Album*, the soundtrack for the 2018 Marvel film *Black Panther*, expanding from an initial request for one song by director Ryan Coogler into a 14-track project released on February 9, 2018. He contributed vocals to five tracks: the opening \"Black Panther\"; \"All the Stars\" with SZA, which served as the lead single; \"X\" alongside ScHoolboy Q, 2 Chainz, and Saudi; \"King's Dead\" with Jay Rock, Future, and James Blake; and \"Pray for Me\" with the Weeknd. The album's production emphasized themes of African heritage and empowerment, aligning with the film's narrative, and topped the Billboard 200 chart upon release.\n\nEarlier, in 2014, Lamar provided a guest verse for \"It's On Again,\" an original track on *The Amazing Spider-Man 2* soundtrack, performed by Alicia Keys and co-produced by Hans Zimmer and Pharrell Williams. The song, released as a single on March 31, 2014, features Lamar's rapid delivery over an orchestral arrangement tailored to the film's superhero action sequences.\n\nIn 2025, Lamar composed an original theme song for Marvel's *Captain America: Brave New World*, as confirmed by lead actor Anthony Mackie, marking another direct contribution to a major superhero film soundtrack.\n\n## Tours\n\n### Major headlining tours\n\nKendrick Lamar's first major headlining tour, the good kid, m.A.A.d city World Tour, supported his 2012 album of the same name and commenced in spring 2013 across North America and Europe. The U.S. leg featured opening acts ScHoolboy Q, Ab-Soul, and Jay Rock, all members of the Black Hippy collective.\n\nThe Damn Tour, launched in 2017 to promote Lamar's album *DAMN.*, began on July 12 in Phoenix, Arizona, and initially spanned 17 North American arena dates, concluding August 6 at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. Supporting acts included Travis Scott and D.R.A.M. The tour extended into 2018, incorporating European, Oceanian, and Asian legs, with additional dates in venues such as London's O2 Arena and Australia's Rod Laver Arena.\n\nIn support of *Mr. Morale \\u0026 the Big Steppers* (2022), Lamar undertook The Big Steppers Tour starting February 5, 2022, in Oklahoma City, encompassing over 70 dates worldwide across arenas and stadiums. The production featured elaborate staging, including a therapist on a therapist's couch and a marching band, emphasizing thematic elements of personal accountability and therapy. By April 2023, it had become the highest-grossing rap tour in history, surpassing Drake's 2018 Summer Sixteen Tour in revenue. A live performance from Paris was streamed on Amazon Prime Video in October 2022.\n\n### Collaborative and festival performances\n\nKendrick Lamar's early festival appearances included a performance at the Pitchfork Music Festival on July 13, 2012, in Chicago's Union Park, where he showcased tracks from *Section.80* such as \"HiiiPower\" and \"Rigamortis,\" drawing acclaim for his energetic delivery and lyrical depth. Subsequent slots at events like Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival in June 2013 further elevated his profile, with sets emphasizing narrative-driven hip-hop amid growing mainstream attention.\n\nIn 2018, Lamar joined forces with Top Dawg Entertainment labelmates for **The Championship Tour**, a collaborative North American outing announced on January 22 that year, featuring SZA, ScHoolboy Q, Jay Rock, Ab-Soul, SiR, and Lance Skiiiwalker across 33 dates starting May 4 in Vancouver, British Columbia.  The tour highlighted TDE's roster synergy, with shared stages fostering intergenerational performances and peaking at venues like The Forum in Inglewood, grossing over $40 million in ticket sales.\n\nLamar's high-profile collaborative showcases extended to televised spectacles, including the Super Bowl LVI halftime show on February 13, 2022, at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, where he performed \"m.A.A.d city\" and \"Alright\" alongside Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Mary J. Blige, and a surprise 50 Cent appearance, blending West Coast rap legacy with contemporary anthems for 116.1 million viewers. Later, on June 19, 2024, he hosted **The Pop Out: Ken \\u0026 Friends** at the Kia Forum, a Juneteenth event uniting Dr. Dre, SZA, ScHoolboy Q, Tyler, the Creator, and over 25 West Coast artists, culminating in five renditions of \"Not Like Us\" amid the Drake feud, streamed live on Amazon Music and Twitch to millions. \n\nExtending into 2025, Lamar co-headlined the **Grand National Tour** with SZA, launching April 19 at U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis and encompassing 39 stadium dates across North America and Europe, with SZA concluding her leg in Stockholm on August 9 before Lamar's solo extensions in Australia and Latin America; sets integrated tracks from their collaborative history, including GNX features, emphasizing thematic unity on racial identity and personal triumph.  Festival engagements persisted, such as his Rolling Loud Miami set on May 7, 2017, balancing high-energy hits like \"Alright\" with introspective cuts like \"PRIDE.\"",
