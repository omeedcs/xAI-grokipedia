  "content": "# Michael Phelps\n\n**Michael Phelps** (born June 30, 1985) is an American former competitive swimmer widely regarded as the most successful and decorated Olympian in history, having won 28 Olympic medals, including a record 23 golds, across five Games from 2000 to 2016. Born in Baltimore, Maryland, and raised primarily by his mother Debbie alongside sisters Hilary and Whitney after his parents' divorce, Phelps was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) at the age of nine.\n\nPhelps discovered swimming at age seven through his sisters and quickly excelled, joining the North Baltimore Aquatic Club and setting a national record for his age group by age ten, which provided a constructive outlet for his high energy amid ADHD-related challenges in school. He made his Olympic debut at the 2000 Sydney Games at just 15 years old, the youngest male U.S. swimmer in nearly seven decades, finishing fifth in the 200-meter butterfly. Over his career, he dominated events like the butterfly, individual medley, freestyle, and backstroke, breaking world records 39 times and earning 33 medals at the World Aquatics Championships. His pinnacle achievements include six golds and two bronzes at the 2004 Athens Olympics, a perfect eight golds at Beijing 2008—surpassing Mark Spitz's single-Games record—and four golds with two silvers at London 2012, followed by five golds and one silver at his final Rio 2016 Games.\n\nStanding 6 feet 4 inches tall with an arm span of 6 feet 7 inches, Phelps' unique physiology—large feet described as \"flippers\" by his coach—contributed to his prowess in the water, where he trained up to six hours daily, six days a week. After retiring following Rio, he has focused on mental health advocacy, drawing from his own experiences with depression and substance abuse, and serves as a volunteer assistant coach. Through the Michael Phelps Foundation, established in 2008, he promotes water safety, healthy living, and physical activity for children, including programs addressing ADHD. Married to former Miss California USA Nicole Johnson since 2016, Phelps is a father to four sons—Boomer (born 2016), Beckett (2018), Maverick (2020), and Nico (2024)—and has ventured into business, co-founding the cold plunge therapy brand Chilly Goat Tubs in 2023 while pursuing interests like golf. At age 40 in 2025, he remains an influential figure in sports, inducted into the U.S. Olympic \\u0026 Paralympic Hall of Fame in 2021 for his enduring legacy.\n\n## Early Life and Education\n\n### Family and Childhood\n\nMichael Phelps was born on June 30, 1985, in Baltimore, Maryland, as the youngest of three children to parents Debbie and Fred Phelps. His older sisters, Hilary and Whitney, were both competitive swimmers who encouraged his early involvement in the sport.\n\nPhelps' parents divorced in 1994 when he was nine years old, after which he lived primarily with his mother and sisters, maintaining a close-knit family bond that emphasized support and resilience. Debbie Phelps, a middle school principal and educator, played a central role in raising the children as a single mother, drawing on her professional experience to guide them through challenges. Fred Phelps, a former Maryland State Trooper and high school and college football player, contributed to the family's athletic ethos despite the separation.\n\nFrom an early age, Phelps faced significant behavioral challenges, including hyperactivity and difficulty focusing, which began in preschool and persisted through kindergarten, where teachers noted his inability to sit still during activities like quiet time or circle time. At age nine in fifth grade—the same year as the divorce—he was diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and treated with Ritalin for several years to manage symptoms. These early struggles tested the family's dynamics but fostered resilience, with his mother's educational background providing structure and his siblings offering emotional support that helped instill discipline.\n\n### Introduction to Swimming and Schooling\n\nMichael Phelps discovered swimming at the age of seven, when his mother enrolled him in a local aquatic club to help manage his attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), providing an outlet for his boundless energy. Initially terrified of the water and refusing to submerge his face, Phelps overcame this fear with the aid of floatation devices and by specializing in backstroke, which allowed him to keep his head above the surface. His family's encouragement in directing his hyperactivity toward structured activities like swimming played a key role in this transition.\n\nAt age seven, Phelps began formal training at the North Baltimore Aquatic Club (NBAC), where he progressed through introductory group sessions under early coaches before transitioning to more intensive instruction with Bob Bowman at age 11. This foundational period at NBAC built his technical skills and discipline, transforming his initial reluctance into a passion for the sport.\n\nPhelps' ADHD presented significant academic challenges throughout his schooling, including difficulty maintaining focus in class and enduring bullying from teachers who claimed he would \"never amount to anything.\" He struggled particularly in middle and high school but persisted with support from tutors and customized learning approaches, such as math problems tied to swimming scenarios. He ultimately graduated from Towson High School in 2003.\n\nPhelps achieved his first competitive successes remarkably young, setting a national age group record in the 100-meter butterfly by age 10 and earning multiple such records in subsequent junior meets. By age 12, he was regularly competing in national youth championships, where his rapid improvement foreshadowed his future dominance. These early victories, including state-level wins in Maryland, reinforced his commitment to swimming as a pathway to success.\n\n## Swimming Career\n\n### Training Under Bob Bowman\n\nMichael Phelps began his partnership with coach Bob Bowman at the age of 11 when he joined the North Baltimore Aquatic Club (NBAC) in Maryland, marking the start of a transformative coach-athlete relationship that emphasized discipline, technical precision, and mental fortitude. Bowman's philosophy centered on pushing athletes beyond their perceived limits through rigorous visualization techniques, where Phelps would spend up to two hours daily mentally rehearsing swims, incorporating sensory details like the smell of chlorine and the feel of water to build resilience against obstacles. This approach complemented intensive dry-land training, including 30-45 minutes six days a week of strength exercises like medicine ball routines and weightlifting, alongside in-pool sessions focused on stroke efficiency, starts, and turns.\n\nPhelps' daily routines under Bowman typically involved two pool sessions totaling five to six hours, accumulating at least 80,000 meters of swimming per week across six or seven days, even on rest days like Sundays. These workouts prioritized endurance and technical refinement, such as extended kicking sets comprising 25% of practice time and consistent butterfly technique drills, while dry-land components incorporated functional weight training three times weekly to enhance power and flexibility. To support recovery, Bowman integrated methods like ice baths, stretching, massages, and adequate sleep, ensuring Phelps could sustain high-intensity demands.\n\nIn 2004, following the Athens Olympics, Phelps relocated to Ann Arbor, Michigan, to continue training under Bowman, who had become the head coach of the University of Michigan men's swimming team. The duo later returned to Baltimore for a period before moving again in 2015 to Tempe, Arizona, where Bowman took the head coaching position at Arizona State University, allowing Phelps to train in a professional group alongside college athletes.\n\nPost-2012, as Phelps aged and prepared for comebacks, the training evolved to prioritize recovery and efficiency over sheer volume, with practices often limited to 6,000 yards or less and reduced to about 50% of prior intensity during Olympic preparations. This shift included periodic altitude training, such as three-week camps in Colorado Springs, and structured nutrition plans supporting 8,000-10,000 daily calories to fuel sustained performance while minimizing injury risk.\n\n### Early International Debut (2000–2003)\n\nAt age 15, Michael Phelps qualified for the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, becoming the youngest American male swimmer to make the Olympic team since Ralph Flanagan in 1932. Competing in the 200-meter butterfly, his only event, Phelps advanced to the final and placed fifth with a time of 1:57.72, marking his international debut on the Olympic stage.\n\nPhelps' breakthrough continued at the 2001 World Aquatics Championships in Fukuoka, Japan, where the 16-year-old claimed his first global title by winning gold in the 200-meter butterfly with a time of 1:54.58, breaking his own world record set earlier that year. This victory established him as a rising prodigy, showcasing the technical prowess honed under coach Bob Bowman at the North Baltimore Aquatic Club.\n\nIn 2002, at the Pan Pacific Swimming Championships in Yokohama, Japan, Phelps earned five medals, including three golds in the 200-meter individual medley (1:59.70), 400-meter individual medley (4:12.48), and as part of the victorious U.S. 4x100-meter medley relay team. He also secured silver medals in the 200-meter butterfly, finishing behind teammate Tom Malchow in 1:55.21, and in the 4x200-meter freestyle relay. These performances highlighted his versatility across strokes and events, solidifying his status among elite swimmers.\n\nPhelps dominated the 2003 World Aquatics Championships in Barcelona, Spain, winning four individual gold medals in the 100-meter butterfly (51.47), 200-meter individual medley (1:55.93), 400-meter individual medley (4:09.09), and 200-meter butterfly (1:54.35). During the meet, he set world records in the 400-meter individual medley and 200-meter individual medley, becoming the first swimmer to break five world records at a single World Championships. He also contributed to gold-medal-winning U.S. relays in the 4x100-meter medley and 4x200-meter freestyle, along with two silvers, for a total of six medals.\n\n### 2004 Athens Olympics\n\nAt the 2004 U.S. Olympic Swimming Trials held in Long Beach, California, from July 7 to 14, 19-year-old Michael Phelps qualified for five individual events, becoming the first American male swimmer to achieve such a feat in a single Olympic cycle. He secured spots in the 200 m freestyle, 400 m individual medley, 100 m butterfly, 200 m butterfly, and 200 m individual medley, while also earning relay berths. In the 400 m individual medley final on July 7, Phelps shattered his own world record with a time of 4:08.41, qualifying decisively and demonstrating the versatility honed in his early training under coach Bob Bowman.\n\nPhelps entered the Athens Olympics, held from August 13 to 29, as a heavy favorite burdened by immense hype, with many predicting he could match or exceed Mark Spitz's record of seven golds from 1972. Competing in eight events, he ultimately earned eight medals—six golds and two bronzes—tying the single-Games record at the time and establishing himself as a global swimming force. His individual golds came in the 400 m individual medley on August 14, where he set a new world record of 4:08.26; the 200 m butterfly on August 17; and the 100 m butterfly on August 20. In the 200 m freestyle on August 16, however, Phelps finished third for bronze behind Australia's Ian Thorpe, who won gold in an Olympic record 1:44.71, highlighting the competitive depth in freestyle events.\n\nPhelps contributed to four relay golds, showcasing his team impact alongside teammates like Jason Lezak, who anchored several victories. The U.S. team, with Phelps swimming butterfly, won the 4 × 100 m medley relay on August 21 in a world-record 3:30.68, fending off a late challenge from Australia. Earlier, on August 17, Phelps led off the 4 × 200 m freestyle relay to gold with a time of 7:07.33, and he swam in the 4 × 100 m freestyle relay final on August 15, though it earned bronze after a strong Australian performance. His final individual event, the 200 m individual medley on August 19, resulted in gold with an Olympic record of 1:57.14, edging out teammate Ryan Lochte.\n\nDespite the haul, Phelps later reflected that the pre-Games pressure to win every event felt overwhelming, leading to a sense of post-Olympic depression as the reality of falling one gold short of Spitz's mark sank in. He described the experience as transformative, fueling motivation for greater dominance in future Games and underscoring his emergence beyond prodigy status.\n\n### Mid-Career Peak (2005–2007)\n\nFollowing his success at the 2004 Athens Olympics, where he secured six gold medals and two bronzes, Michael Phelps entered a dominant phase in major international competitions outside the Games. At the 2005 World Aquatics Championships in Montreal, Canada, Phelps claimed five gold medals and one silver, demonstrating his prowess in both individual and relay events. He won gold in the 200 m freestyle (1:45.61) and the 200 m individual medley (1:56.68, tying the championship record), along with golds in the 4×100 m freestyle relay, 4×200 m freestyle relay, and 4×100 m medley relay; his silver came in the 100 m butterfly (51.65), where he finished behind teammate Ian Crocker.\n\nIn 2006, Phelps continued his ascent at the Pan Pacific Swimming Championships in Victoria, Canada, where he secured four individual gold medals, effectively sweeping the individual medley events and showcasing versatility in butterfly. He triumphed in the 100 m butterfly (52.07, Pan Pacific record), 200 m butterfly (1:53.80, world record), 200 m individual medley (1:55.84, world record), and 400 m individual medley (4:10.47). These victories highlighted his technical refinement and ability to excel across multiple strokes, contributing to the United States' strong relay performances as well.\n\nPhelps reached the zenith of this period at the 2007 World Aquatics Championships in Melbourne, Australia, capturing seven gold medals—five individual and two in relays—while setting multiple world records that underscored his unparalleled versatility. His individual golds included the 200 m freestyle (1:44.10), 100 m butterfly (50.89), 200 m butterfly (1:52.09, world record), 200 m individual medley (1:54.98, world record), and 400 m individual medley (4:06.22, world record); he also anchored winning efforts in the 4×100 m freestyle relay and 4×200 m freestyle relay. This haul tied the record for most gold medals at a single World Championships, previously set by Mark Spitz in 1972.\n\nCentral to Phelps' mid-career dominance were refinements in his starts and underwater dolphin kicks, honed under coach Bob Bowman, which allowed him to gain critical early advantages and maintain speed off the walls. These techniques, including extended underwater phases with powerful undulations, contributed to margins of victory often exceeding two seconds in individual events, as seen in his 2007 world-record swims where he stayed submerged longer than competitors without surfacing penalties.\n\n### 2008 Beijing Olympics\n\nPhelps entered the 2008 U.S. Olympic Trials in Omaha, Nebraska, aiming to qualify for a demanding schedule of eight events, building on his strong performances at the 2007 World Championships where he won seven golds. He dominated the competition, winning six individual events and securing spots on three relays, qualifying for all eight targeted events with times that included U.S. Open records in the 200-meter freestyle (1:44.10) and 200-meter individual medley (1:54.80).\n\nAt the Beijing Olympics, Phelps achieved an unprecedented feat by winning gold in all eight events he contested, surpassing Mark Spitz's 1972 record of seven golds in a single Games. His victories came in the 400-meter individual medley (4:03.84, world record), 4x100-meter freestyle relay (3:08.24, world record, anchored by Jason Lezak), 200-meter freestyle (1:42.96, world record), 200-meter butterfly (1:52.03, world record), 200-meter individual medley (1:54.23, world record), 4x200-meter freestyle relay (6:58.55, world record), 100-meter butterfly (50.58, Olympic record), and 4x100-meter medley relay (3:27.28, world record). These performances contributed to 25 world records set across the swimming program at the Games.\n\nKey moments defined Phelps' campaign, including the dramatic 4x100-meter freestyle relay final where the U.S. team trailed France by over 0.6 seconds entering Lezak's anchor leg; Lezak's 46.06 split—a personal best and the fastest 100-meter freestyle ever—secured the win by 0.08 seconds, preserving Phelps' undefeated streak. In the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps staged a stunning comeback from seventh place at the turn to edge Serbia's Milorad Čavić by one hundredth of a second (50.58 to 50.59) in one of the closest finishes in Olympic history, clinching his seventh gold and tying Spitz's record. The eighth gold in the medley relay the following day cemented his historic achievement.\n\nAmid heightened scrutiny over performance-enhancing drugs in swimming, fueled by the era's controversies and the prevalence of new high-tech suits, Phelps underwent at least eight drug tests during the Games, all returning negative results, which he publicly affirmed as proof of his clean competition.\n\n### Later Career Challenges (2009–2011)\n\nFollowing the unprecedented success at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, where he secured eight gold medals, Michael Phelps faced a transitional period marked by competitive setbacks and personal adjustments in his training regimen. At the 2009 FINA World Championships in Rome, Phelps earned five gold medals, including world records in the 100-meter butterfly (49.82 seconds) and 200-meter butterfly (1:51.51), as well as victories in the 200-meter individual medley and both the 4x100-meter freestyle and medley relays. However, he experienced a notable defeat in the 200-meter freestyle, finishing second behind Germany's Paul Biedermann, who shattered Phelps's Olympic world record of 1:42.96 with a time of 1:42.00, highlighting the impact of the then-legal polyurethane suits on performance disparities.\n\nIn 2010, at the Pan Pacific Swimming Championships in Irvine, California, Phelps rebounded with four gold medals, prominently reclaiming dominance in the 200-meter butterfly with a winning time of 1:54.11, alongside triumphs in the 100-meter butterfly and key relays including the 4x100-meter freestyle, 4x200-meter freestyle, and 4x100-meter medley events. These victories demonstrated his continued relay prowess and individual strength in butterfly events, though he opted out of the 200-meter individual medley to manage his schedule.\n\nThe 2011 FINA World Championships in Shanghai presented further challenges, where Phelps collected four gold medals—primarily through relays such as the 4x200-meter freestyle and 4x100-meter medley—along with three silvers and one bronze, totaling seven medals. His individual results showed signs of a slight decline, including a bronze in the 200-meter butterfly (1:54.58), where he was outpaced by South Africa's Chad le Clos, signaling emerging international competition in his signature event. Despite these outcomes, Phelps's relay contributions underscored his value to the U.S. team, adapting to a field increasingly led by teammates like Ryan Lochte.\n\nThis era was compounded by minor injuries, such as a fractured foot in late 2009 that sidelined him for a month and a sore ankle from a car accident earlier that year, alongside acknowledged dips in motivation and training intensity following the Beijing pinnacle. These factors contributed to inconsistent individual results but did not derail his overall medal haul, as Phelps focused on recovery and strategic event selection to rebuild momentum toward future competitions.\n\n### 2012 London Olympics\n\nPhelps entered the 2012 U.S. Olympic Trials in Omaha, Nebraska, aiming to qualify for his third Olympic Games amid intense domestic competition, particularly from Ryan Lochte. He secured spots in five individual events: winning the 200-meter freestyle in 1:44.87, the 200-meter butterfly in 1:53.57, the 200-meter individual medley in 1:54.84 (edging Lochte by 0.09 seconds), and the 100-meter butterfly in 51.14, while finishing second in the 400-meter individual medley behind Lochte's time of 4:07.06.\n\nAt the London Olympics, Phelps competed in six events, earning four gold medals and two silvers for a total of six medals, bringing his career Olympic tally to 18 and making him the most decorated Olympian in history at that point. His golds came in the 200-meter individual medley (1:54.27), 100-meter butterfly (51.21), 4x200-meter freestyle relay (team time 6:59.70 with Phelps anchoring), and 4x100-meter medley relay (team time 3:27.45). The silvers were in the 200-meter butterfly (1:53.01) and the 4x100-meter freestyle relay final (team time 3:10.91).\n\nAmong the standout performances, Phelps' victory in the 200-meter individual medley marked the first time a male swimmer had won three consecutive Olympic golds in the same event, tying the overall record held by Dawn Fraser (100-meter freestyle) and Krisztina Egerszegi (200-meter backstroke). He also anchored the winning 4x200-meter freestyle and 4x100-meter medley relays, contributing to team successes despite not swimming the 4x100-meter freestyle final. In the 200-meter butterfly, South Africa's Chad le Clos narrowly defeated him by 0.05 seconds for gold, marking Phelps' only individual non-gold of the Games.\n\nFollowing the 4x100-meter medley relay gold on August 4, Phelps announced his retirement from competitive swimming at age 27, describing the Games as a fitting capstone to his career during an emotional post-race interview where he expressed relief and gratitude.\n\n### Retirement and Comeback (2013–2015)\n\nFollowing his triumphant performance at the 2012 London Olympics, where he secured four gold medals and two silvers to become the most decorated Olympian in history, Michael Phelps announced his retirement from competitive swimming at age 27.\n\nDuring his 2013 retirement hiatus, Phelps pursued personal interests outside the pool, notably immersing himself in golf by training under Hank Haney, the former coach of Tiger Woods, and traveling to play on prestigious courses worldwide. He also dedicated time to philanthropy through the Michael Phelps Foundation, established in 2008, which focuses on promoting water safety, healthy living, and youth swimming programs.\n\nIn April 2014, Phelps revealed plans for a comeback, driven by renewed enjoyment in training, and returned to competition at the Arena Grand Prix in Mesa, Arizona, where he placed second in the 100-meter butterfly final with a time of 52.13 seconds, behind rival Ryan Lochte. He followed this with a victory in the 100-meter butterfly at the Charlotte UltraSwim meet later that month, clocking 51.86 seconds.\n\nA DUI arrest in September 2014 resulted in a six-month suspension from USA Swimming, barring Phelps from the 2015 FINA World Championships in Kazan. He resumed racing in January 2015 at the Austin Grand Prix, winning the 100-meter butterfly in 52.03 seconds. At the 2015 Phillips 66 U.S. National Championships in August, Phelps delivered dominant performances, capturing gold in the 100-meter butterfly (50.45 seconds, the year's fastest globally), 200-meter butterfly (1:52.94, the year's fastest), and 200-meter individual medley (1:54.75, the year's fastest), reaffirming his elite status ahead of the Rio Olympics.\n\n### 2016 Rio Olympics\n\nAt the 2016 U.S. Olympic Trials in Omaha, Nebraska, from June 26 to July 3, 30-year-old Michael Phelps qualified for his fifth Olympic Games by winning the 100 m butterfly in 51.00 seconds, the 200 m butterfly in 1:54.84, and the 200 m individual medley in 1:55.91, while also earning spots on the 4×100 m freestyle, 4×200 m freestyle, and 4×100 m medley relay teams.\n\nIn Rio de Janeiro, Phelps competed in six events at the Olympic Aquatics Stadium, securing five gold medals and one silver to conclude his career with a total of 28 Olympic medals—23 of them gold—the most in history. His individual victories included gold in the 200 m butterfly on August 9, marking his fourth consecutive Olympic title in the event with a time of 1:53.36 ahead of Japan's Masato Sakai; and gold in the 200 m individual medley on August 11, his fourth straight in that discipline at 1:54.66 over Japan's Kosuke Hagino. Phelps also contributed to U.S. victories in the 4×100 m freestyle relay (gold on August 7), 4×200 m freestyle relay (gold on August 9), and 4×100 m medley relay (gold on August 13).\n\nA highlight came in the 100 m butterfly final on August 12, where Phelps tied for silver at 51.14 seconds with South Africa's Chad le Clos and Hungary's László Cseh, behind Singapore's Joseph Schooling who claimed gold in 50.96 and set an Olympic record. Phelps anchored the emotional 4×100 m medley relay win with a 52.52-second butterfly leg, helping the U.S. team to victory in 3:27.27 and confirming his retirement from competitive swimming after the race.\n\n### Career Statistics and Personal Bests\n\nMichael Phelps amassed a total of 82 medals in major international long-course competitions, comprising 65 gold, 14 silver, and 3 bronze, across the Olympics, FINA World Aquatics Championships, and Pan Pacific Championships. Of these, approximately 39 were individual medals and 43 relay medals, reflecting his versatility in solo events and team contributions. His medal distribution highlighted specializations in butterfly (particularly 100m and 200m, where he secured multiple golds), individual medley (200m and 400m, with dominant performances in both), and freestyle (200m individual and relay anchors), alongside medley relay legs that leveraged his all-around skills.\n\nIn long-course meters (50m pools), Phelps' personal bests underscored his peak efficiency during the 2008 Beijing Olympics and surrounding years. Notable times include 1:42.96 in the 200m freestyle (Beijing 2008), 4:03.84 in the 400m individual medley (Beijing 2008), and 1:51.51 in the 200m butterfly (2009 World Championships). These marks, achieved under high-stakes conditions, established benchmarks for stroke technique and endurance, with the 200m butterfly best remaining a career highlight for its blend of speed and power.\n\nShort-course meters (25m pools) bests, often set in World Cup meets, demonstrated Phelps' adaptability to faster turns and pacing. Key examples are 1:42.78 in the 200m freestyle (2006 FINA World Cup), 4:01.49 in the 400m individual medley (2011 FINA World Cup), and 1:52.26 in the 200m butterfly (2009 FINA World Cup). These times, typically 1-2 seconds quicker than long-course equivalents due to reduced drag and more wall pushes, highlighted his technical proficiency in controlled environments.\n\nPhelps' progression in the 200m butterfly, a signature event, illustrates his career evolution from prodigy to dominant force. Early marks included 1:57.48 as a 15-year-old at the 2000 U.S. Trials, dropping to 1:54.92 for his first world record in 2001. By 2004, he swam 1:54.04 at the Athens Olympics; this improved to 1:52.09 at the 2007 World Championships and 1:52.03 in Beijing 2008. His lifetime best of 1:51.51 came at the 2009 World Championships, though later years saw slight regressions, such as 1:53.36 in Rio 2016, reflecting age and training focus shifts.\n\n## Records and Achievements\n\n### World and Olympic Records\n\nMichael Phelps set a total of 39 world records in swimming between 2001 and 2009, including both long-course and short-course events, with eight of those established at Olympic Games.\n\nIn long-course meters (50-meter pools), Phelps established 29 individual world records across various events, demonstrating his versatility in freestyle, butterfly, and individual medley disciplines. Notable examples include his 200-meter butterfly world record of 1:51.51, set at the 2009 World Aquatics Championships in Rome, which stood until 2021. He held the long-course world record in the 400-meter individual medley at 4:03.84, achieved during the 2008 Beijing Olympics, which stood until 2023 when broken by Léon Marchand with 4:02.50. Phelps broke the 400-meter individual medley world record eight times between 2002 and 2008, underscoring his dominance in the event.\n\nPhelps set seven short-course world records (25-meter pools), primarily in butterfly and medley events during indoor competitions. A key achievement was his 100-meter butterfly short-course world record of 49.85 seconds at the 2009 Duel in the Pool meet in Manchester, England.\n\nPhelps set numerous Olympic records throughout his career, including individual and relay performances that advanced swimming standards. His individual Olympic record in the 200-meter freestyle stands at 1:42.96 from the 2008 Beijing Games. In the 200-meter individual medley, he set an Olympic record of 1:54.23 at the 2016 Rio Olympics, which stood until 2024 when broken by Léon Marchand with 1:54.06, marking his fourth consecutive gold in the event. Phelps contributed to Olympic records in relays, such as the American 4x200-meter freestyle team's 6:58.56 at Beijing 2008. As of 2025, Phelps still holds three Olympic records: the men's 200 m freestyle (1:42.96, Beijing 2008) and contributions to the men's 4 × 100 m freestyle relay (3:08.24) and 4 × 200 m freestyle relay (6:58.56), both from Beijing 2008.\n\nPhelps earned multiple Guinness World Records related to his Olympic achievements, including the most Olympic gold medals by a swimmer with 23 across five Games from 2004 to 2016. He also holds the record for the most Olympic medals overall in swimming with 28. Additionally, at age 15, Phelps became the youngest male swimmer to represent the United States at the Olympics since Ralph Flanagan in 1932, competing at the 2000 Sydney Games.\n\n### Awards and Honors\n\nMichael Phelps received numerous prestigious awards and honors throughout his swimming career, recognizing his dominance in the sport and his contributions to Olympic success. In 2008, following his record-breaking performance at the Beijing Olympics, he was named Sports Illustrated's Sportsman of the Year, an accolade highlighting his unprecedented achievement of eight gold medals in a single Games. That same year, the Associated Press selected him as Male Athlete of the Year, a testament to his global impact on sports.\n\nPhelps also earned the Associated Press Male Athlete of the Year award again in 2012, after securing four gold and two silver medals at the London Olympics, edging out competitors like LeBron James in the voting. The United States Olympic Committee (USOC, now USOPC) honored him multiple times with its SportsMan of the Year award, first in 2008 for his Beijing triumphs, then in 2012 as the third recipient of this distinction in his career, and again in 2016 following his five gold medals in Rio de Janeiro. In 2007, prior to the Beijing Games, he was awarded the USOC's Outstanding Performance of the Year for his seven gold medals at the World Championships.\n\nPhelps' legacy was further cemented through formal inductions into halls of fame. In 2022, he was inducted into the U.S. Olympic \\u0026 Paralympic Hall of Fame as part of the Class of 2022, acknowledging his status as the most decorated Olympian with 28 medals. The following year, in 2023, he joined the International Swimming Hall of Fame, where his page details his extraordinary record of 23 Olympic golds, 33 World Championship medals, and 39 world records.\n\nAmong lesser-known tributes, Phelps inspired the development of video games bearing his name during his peak years, such as the 2011 Xbox 360 title *Michael Phelps: Push the Limit*, which simulated competitive swimming and allowed players to race virtually against him, reflecting his cultural influence beyond the pool.\n\n## Personal Life\n\n### Family and Marriage\n\nMichael Phelps began dating Nicole Johnson, a former Miss California USA, in 2007 after meeting at the ESPY Awards, though their relationship was on-and-off for several years due to his intense training schedule. The couple announced their engagement on February 22, 2015, via social media, with Phelps proposing during a trip to Capri, Italy. They married secretly on June 13, 2016, in Paradise Valley, Arizona, shortly after the birth of their first child, but the union became public knowledge in October 2016 when their marriage certificate was reported by local media.\n\nPhelps and Johnson have four sons, all born in Arizona, where the family resides in Paradise Valley. Their first child, Boomer Robert Phelps, was born on May 5, 2016. Beckett Richard Phelps arrived on February 12, 2018, followed by Maverick Nicholas Phelps on September 9, 2019. Their youngest, Nico Michael Phelps, was born on January 16, 2024. The Phelps family maintains a routine centered on shared dinners and outdoor activities, emphasizing a supportive home environment amid Phelps' post-retirement commitments.\n\nIn October 2022, Phelps announced the death of his father, Fred Phelps Sr., a former Maryland state trooper, sharing a heartfelt Instagram tribute with childhood photos and expressing gratitude for their reconciled relationship in later years. Phelps has maintained close bonds with his mother, Debbie Phelps, a retired educator who raised him as a single parent after her 1994 divorce from Fred, and his two older sisters, Hilary and Whitney, who introduced him to swimming in their youth and continue to support his endeavors.\n\nPhelps has described fatherhood as transformative, helping him prioritize family while navigating public life, including bringing Johnson and their children to Olympic events such as the 2016 Rio Games—where infant Boomer joined celebrations—and the 2024 Paris Olympics. The family often travels together for advocacy work and appearances, with Phelps crediting Johnson's role in maintaining balance during high-profile moments.\n\n### Legal Issues and Arrests\n\nIn November 2004, shortly after winning six gold medals at the Athens Olympics, Phelps was arrested in Salisbury, Maryland, for driving under the influence of alcohol. He pleaded guilty to the charge and was sentenced to 18 months of probation, a $250 fine, and 50 hours of community service.\n\nIn February 2009, a British tabloid published a photograph of Phelps inhaling from a marijuana pipe at a private party in South Carolina the previous November, prompting a police investigation in Richland County. Although no formal charges were filed due to the time elapsed since the incident, Phelps publicly apologized for his \"regrettable behavior and poor judgment,\" and the event led to a three-month suspension from USA Swimming as well as the termination of his sponsorship deal with Kellogg's.\n\nPhelps faced his second DUI arrest on September 30, 2014, in Baltimore, Maryland, where he was stopped for excessive speed—84 mph in a 45 mph zone—crossing double lane lines, and failing field sobriety tests with a blood-alcohol level of 0.14, nearly twice the legal limit. He pleaded guilty to the DUI charge in December 2014, receiving a one-year suspended jail sentence, 18 months of supervised probation, a six-month driver's license suspension, a $250 fine, and a requirement to complete a substance abuse evaluation and treatment program; he opted for inpatient rehabilitation instead of jail time. The incident also resulted in a six-month suspension from USA Swimming.\n\n### Mental Health Struggles\n\nMichael Phelps has openly discussed experiencing profound mental health challenges, particularly bouts of severe depression and anxiety that intensified after major Olympic achievements. Following the 2012 London Olympics, where he secured four gold medals and two silvers, Phelps entered a deep depression marked by isolation and suicidal ideation, describing a period where he \"didn't want to be in the sport anymore\" and felt life was unbearable. He later reflected that this post-competition void was a recurring pattern after each Olympics, exacerbating feelings of purposelessness despite his unparalleled success.\n\nThe severity of his struggles peaked again in 2014, triggered in part by legal stressors including a second DUI arrest, which prompted Phelps to confront his mental health head-on. At this low point, he voluntarily entered a 45-day inpatient rehabilitation program focused on addressing depression, anxiety, and substance-related issues, marking his first formal engagement with therapy. Phelps has credited this intensive treatment with being a turning point, stating that therapy helped him \"rebuild\" himself by unpacking long-suppressed emotions and learning coping mechanisms.\n\nAfter the 2016 Rio Olympics, where he added five gold medals and one silver to his tally, Phelps faced another intense wave of depression, feeling \"the most overwhelmed I've ever felt\" amid the transition from competition. Although he did not return to inpatient care, he maintained ongoing therapy sessions to manage symptoms, emphasizing how these post-Games lows highlighted the mental toll of his career. Throughout these episodes, Phelps has described anxiety as a constant companion, often manifesting as overwhelming worry that compounded his depressive states.\n\nPhelps transitioned to public advocacy for mental health beginning in 2017, sharing his experiences in high-profile interviews to destigmatize seeking help among athletes and the general public. His 2008 autobiography *Beneath the Surface*, updated in 2012, provided an early foundation by detailing his childhood battles with ADHD and family challenges, which he later connected to his adult mental health issues in subsequent discussions. In 2018, he partnered with the online therapy platform Talkspace for a national campaign encouraging open conversations about mental health, featuring personal testimonials on television and digital media.\n\nThese mental health battles significantly shaped Phelps' career trajectory and personal priorities. The depression following the 2012 Games contributed to his initial retirement announcement, though he unretired for Rio; his final retirement in 2016 was influenced by a desire to prioritize long-term well-being over further competition. In terms of family life, Phelps has acknowledged that his struggles have informed his commitment to modeling emotional openness, noting how therapy enabled him to be more present despite ongoing challenges.\n\n## Post-Retirement Activities\n\n### Coaching and Broadcasting Roles\n\nFollowing his retirement from competitive swimming, Michael Phelps has engaged in coaching roles to share his expertise with emerging athletes. In 2016, he joined longtime coach Bob Bowman as a volunteer assistant for the Arizona State Sun Devils swimming and diving team, drawing on their decades-long partnership that shaped Phelps' own career. This involvement allowed him to contribute to collegiate training sessions and mentor swimmers directly on deck.\n\nPhelps has also provided mentorship to top competitors, notably seven-time Olympic gold medalist Caeleb Dressel. During preparations for the Tokyo Olympics, Phelps advised Dressel on the need for flawless execution to maximize medal potential, emphasizing consistency in training and race strategy. Dressel later credited Phelps for ongoing support throughout the Games, noting frequent consultations that helped navigate high-pressure moments more than interactions with family. Additionally, Phelps has appeared as a guest coach at swimming camps, offering hands-on instruction in technique and mindset to young athletes.\n\nTransitioning to broadcasting, Phelps served as an on-air analyst and correspondent for NBC's coverage of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, delivering expert commentary on swimming events such as relays and butterfly races alongside broadcasters like Dan Hicks and Rowdy Gaines. He returned in this capacity for the 2024 Paris Olympics, contributing to both daytime and primetime programming with in-depth analysis of competitive dynamics. During the Paris broadcast, Phelps publicly voiced disappointment in the U.S. men's team's results, describing the outcomes as underwhelming and urging systemic changes to regain dominance ahead of the 2028 Los Angeles Games.\n\n### Business and Endorsements\n\nMichael Phelps has leveraged his Olympic success into lucrative endorsement deals throughout his career. He signed a lifetime sponsorship agreement with Speedo in 2001, which lasted until 2014 and included a $1 million bonus for winning eight gold medals at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. In 2014, Phelps transitioned to a long-term partnership with Under Armour, a Baltimore-based company, reportedly worth millions and focusing on performance apparel. He has also maintained an ongoing endorsement with Omega watches, promoting their timing technology in swimming events since the early 2000s. These deals, amplified by his record-breaking Olympic achievements, have generated tens of millions in earnings.\n\nPost-retirement from competitive swimming in 2016, Phelps shifted toward entrepreneurial pursuits. In 2015, he co-founded the MP brand in partnership with Aqua Sphere, launching performance swimwear and equipment such as the Xpresso racing suit and XCEED goggles, designed to enhance competitive swimming. He served on the board of directors of Medibio, an Australian mental health technology company, from 2017 until his resignation in 2019, drawing on his personal advocacy to support objective diagnostic tools for disorders like depression. In 2023, Phelps co-founded Chilly Goat Tubs with Master Spas, a brand specializing in cold plunge therapy products for recovery and wellness. Phelps has expressed interest in broader venture investments, particularly in Silicon Valley startups related to sports and health tech, as part of his post-athletic career diversification.\n\nPhelps' business endeavors have contributed significantly to his financial standing. As of 2025, his net worth is estimated at $100 million, primarily from endorsements and investments. He owns real estate in Scottsdale, Arizona, including a 6,010-square-foot home purchased for $2.5 million in 2015.\n\n## Philanthropy and Advocacy\n\n### Michael Phelps Foundation\n\nThe Michael Phelps Foundation was established in 2008 by Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps, who donated a $1 million bonus from sponsor Speedo to launch the organization. Its core mission centers on expanding access to youth swimming and promoting healthy living through education on water safety, physical activity, and goal-setting skills. The foundation's flagship IM Program integrates learn-to-swim instruction with wellness components, including a specialized adaptation for athletes with intellectual disabilities in partnership with Special Olympics International, helping participants build confidence and skills in the water.\n\nTo address barriers in swimming access, the foundation partners with the Level Field Fund to provide grants supporting competitive swimmers from financially challenged backgrounds, enabling continued training and competition. These efforts extend to underserved communities by funding swim lessons and resources, such as through collaborations with organizations like Boys \\u0026 Girls Clubs of America and initiatives that have reached over 400 children in recent grants. Additional partnerships, including with Pool Safely—a program of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission—focus on water safety education to prevent drownings.\n\nFundraising occurs through annual events like the Stadium Classic golf tournament, which has raised tens of thousands for the foundation's programs, and ongoing initiatives such as Caps for a Cause, where autographed swim caps are auctioned to support nonprofit efforts in swimming and wellness. By 2025, the Level Field Fund partnership had awarded over 421 grants to athletes since 2002, demonstrating the foundation's impact in providing financial support to emerging talent.\n\nFollowing Phelps' retirement from competitive swimming in 2016, the foundation evolved to incorporate mental health resources, expanding its curriculum with eight emotional wellness lessons on resilience and confidence, informed by Phelps' personal experiences with mental health challenges. This shift integrates mental wellness into all programs, equipping children with tools for overall well-being beyond the pool.\n\n### Water Safety and Youth Programs\n\nThe Michael Phelps Foundation operates the Caps for a Cause program, through which eligible non-profit organizations receive autographed swim caps from Phelps to auction at fundraising events, generating support for initiatives that expand access to swimming and encourage healthy, active lifestyles among children. By bolstering swim education efforts, the program contributes to broader water safety goals, particularly in addressing the persistent threat of drowning—the leading cause of death for U.S. children aged 1–4 and resulting in approximately 1,000 deaths annually among children and adolescents aged 0–19.\n\nA cornerstone of the foundation's youth initiatives is the IM Program, which delivers interactive camps and lessons blending water safety instruction, swimming technique development, nutrition guidance, and personal goal-setting to build children's confidence both in and out of the water. Inspired by Phelps' own experiences, these programs emphasize holistic wellness and have engaged participants globally, primarily through collaborations with youth-serving organizations.\n\nTo promote inclusive swimming, the foundation partners with Special Olympics to tailor the IM Program for athletes with intellectual disabilities, enhancing their water comfort, skills, and safety awareness in supportive environments. Phelps has also supported Make-A-Wish by granting swimming-related wishes to children facing critical illnesses, providing personalized aquatic experiences that align with the foundation's mission of accessible water safety education.\n\nPhelps has amplified these efforts through public advocacy, notably in a 2016 appearance on *The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon*, where he outlined his post-retirement commitment to teaching children to swim as a means to prevent drownings and inspire lifelong water safety.\n\n### Governance Reform Efforts\n\nIn August 2025, Michael Phelps publicly criticized USA Swimming's leadership through a detailed Instagram statement, highlighting systemic failures in athlete welfare and development amid declining U.S. performance. He pointed to the disappointment of the 2024 Paris Olympics, where the U.S. men's swimming team secured only 9 medals compared to 22 in Rio 2016, attributing this to \"cracks in the system\" that had widened over nine years under poor governance. Phelps emphasized that his observations, informed by his legacy as the most decorated Olympian with 28 medals, positioned him to advocate for change, stating, \"This is on the leadership of USA Swimming. Poor leadership trickles down.\"\n\nPhelps advocated for an independent 360-degree review of USA Swimming's Board of Directors and overall organization to address these issues, proposing enhanced mental health support services for athletes and a focus on long-term medal sustainability beyond Olympic cycles. He criticized the organization's handling of athlete voices, noting instances where concerns were dismissed with advice to \"be grateful\" and \"stay quiet,\" which exacerbated welfare challenges. To ensure sustainability, Phelps called for investments in grassroots development to rebuild membership levels, which had not recovered to pre-pandemic figures. USA Swimming responded to the criticism, expressing disappointment in the public approach, but Phelps refuted claims of prior outreach in a follow-up statement later that month.\n\nHis proposals for systemic overhaul included greater coach accountability to prevent leadership instability—such as the 2024 firing of CEO Tim Hinchey and the brief resignation of interim leader Chrissi Rawak—and full transparency in funding allocation to support athlete programs effectively. Phelps offered his expertise as a resource for these initial steps, underscoring the need for reforms ahead of the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics to restore U.S. dominance, as evidenced by the narrow 9-8 gold medal edge over Australia at the 2025 World Aquatics Championships.\n\nIn November 2025, Phelps continued his advocacy efforts by speaking on mental health at the Sydney Business Forum, emphasizing open dialogues about personal struggles.",
