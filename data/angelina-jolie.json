  "content": "# Angelina Jolie\n\nAngelina Jolie Voight (born June 4, 1975) is an American actress, filmmaker, and former humanitarian envoy for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Born in Los Angeles, California, to actors Jon Voight and Marcheline Bertrand, she rose to prominence in the late 1990s with intense dramatic roles, earning the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her portrayal of the sociopathic patient Lisa Rowe in *Girl, Interrupted* (1999).  \n\nJolie's subsequent career encompassed high-grossing action and fantasy films, including the *Tomb Raider* series as Lara Croft, *Mr. \\u0026 Mrs. Smith* (2005), and *Maleficent* (2014), which solidified her status as one of Hollywood's most bankable stars with earnings exceeding $120 million in personal net worth from acting and production. She transitioned to directing with *In the Land of Blood and Honey* (2011), followed by *Unbroken* (2014), a World War II biopic, and *First They Killed My Father* (2017), a Khmer Rouge-era survival story based on a Cambodian memoir, reflecting her interest in historical atrocities tied to her adoptive son's heritage.  \n\nAppointed UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador in 2001 and Special Envoy in 2012, Jolie conducted over 40 field missions to refugee sites worldwide, advocating for increased funding and legal protections for displaced persons while personally donating millions to relief efforts in regions like Cambodia, Yemen, and Syria; she stepped down from the role in 2022 after two decades. In her personal life, Jolie has six children—Maddox, Pax, and Zahara adopted singly, and Shiloh, Knox, and Vivienne with actor Brad Pitt—following marriages to Jonny Lee Miller (1996–2000) and Billy Bob Thornton (2000–2003), and a union with Pitt from 2014 until separation amid a prolonged, acrimonious divorce involving custody allegations and asset disputes. Facing elevated cancer risks from a BRCA1 mutation, she elected a prophylactic double mastectomy in 2013, later undergoing ovarian surgery, decisions she publicized to encourage genetic testing.\n\n## Early Life and Formative Years\n\n### Family Background and Childhood\n\nAngelina Jolie was born Angelina Jolie Voight on June 4, 1975, at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, California, to actors Jon Voight and Marcheline Bertrand. Voight, born December 29, 1938, in Yonkers, New York, to a Slovak-American father and German-American mother, achieved prominence with an Academy Award for Best Actor for *Midnight Cowboy* (1969). Bertrand, born Marcia Lynne Bertrand on January 9, 1950, in Beverly Hills, California, pursued acting and producing roles while claiming French-Canadian, Dutch, German, and Iroquois ancestry, though the Indigenous heritage was described by Voight as minimal and remote. \n\nVoight and Bertrand married in 1971 and had two children: son James Haven, born May 11, 1973, and daughter Jolie. The couple separated in 1976, when Jolie was one year old, amid reports of Voight's infidelity, and divorced in 1978. Following the split, Bertrand primarily raised the children in a modest apartment in New York City and later Los Angeles, prioritizing their stability over her own career ambitions, while maintaining limited contact with Voight. Haven and Jolie developed a close sibling bond during this period, shaped by their mother's emphasis on family resilience amid the divorce's fallout.\n\nJolie's early childhood was immersed in the film industry through her parents' professions, yet marked by the instability of the divorce and Bertrand's decision to shield the children from Hollywood excess. Bertrand, who later focused on humanitarian work, instilled values of empathy and independence, though she battled financial and emotional challenges as a single mother post-separation. Voight's ongoing fame contrasted with the family's more grounded circumstances, contributing to early tensions; Jolie later cited her parents' marital breakdown, particularly Voight's absence and affairs, as influencing her views on relationships. Bertrand died on January 27, 2007, at age 56 from ovarian and breast cancer after an eight-year battle, an event that profoundly affected Jolie.\n\n### Education, Early Rebellion, and Personal Struggles\n\nJolie attended Beverly Hills High School, where she felt alienated among affluent peers and endured severe bullying related to her thin frame, braces, and perceived lower socioeconomic status compared to classmates. She transferred to the nearby Moreno High School, which provided a more inclusive setting amid ongoing personal turmoil. Aspiring to act, she enrolled in the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute around age 16, following her mother's prior studies there, and trained intensively for two years, honing skills through method acting techniques that emphasized emotional immersion. This formal training supplemented sporadic homeschooling and her early modeling gigs, allowing her to forgo a conventional high school diploma in favor of a GED equivalent by age 18, prioritizing career entry over traditional academia.\n\nIn her early teens, Jolie exhibited pronounced rebellion, experimenting extensively with illicit substances including cocaine, heroin, ecstasy, and LSD, which she later described as encompassing \"everything\" available. At age 14, amid familial instability following her parents' 1978 divorce, her mother Marcheline Bertrand permitted a live-in boyfriend, enabling Jolie to leave home temporarily and deepen her immersion in self-destructive patterns. She engaged in self-mutilation by cutting herself with knives, a habit tied to emotional dysregulation and identity exploration, often wearing black clothing and collecting blades as symbols of her \"goth\" phase. These behaviors stemmed partly from resentment toward her estranged father Jon Voight's infidelity and absence, exacerbating feelings of abandonment and fueling a deliberate provocation of Hollywood's underbelly.\n\nJolie's personal struggles intensified with profound depression and suicidal ideation during adolescence; she contemplated ending her life through a hired assassin to stage it as murder, reflecting a desire for dramatic finality rather than conventional self-harm. This period overlapped with heroin addiction, which she characterized as a fascination rather than mere experimentation, leading to overdoses and institutionalization threats before quitting cold turkey in her early 20s upon recognizing its futility. Familial discord, including Voight's public claims of her mental instability in the late 1990s—alleging borderline personality disorder—further strained relations, though Jolie attributed her recovery to motherhood's later onset and deliberate rejection of escapist vices. These experiences, while self-reported in interviews, underscore a causal link between parental estrangement, unchecked autonomy, and adolescent risk-taking, absent countervailing structure from formal education or therapy.\n\n## Acting Career\n\n### Initial Roles and Breakthrough (1990s)\n\nJolie secured her first leading role in the 1993 direct-to-video science fiction film *Cyborg 2*, portraying Cash Reese, a replicant assassin created by a megacorporation. Directed by Michael Schroeder on a modest budget, the film featured co-stars Elias Koteas and Jack Palance but failed to achieve theatrical release in the United States and received largely negative reviews for its script and effects.\n\nHer breakthrough to wider visibility occurred in 1995 with *Hackers*, directed by Iain Softley, where she played Kate \"Acid Burn\" Libby, a skilled teenage hacker entangled in a corporate conspiracy. The MGM-distributed film, co-starring Jonny Lee Miller, emphasized cyberpunk aesthetics and early internet culture but underperformed commercially, earning about $7.7 million worldwide against a $20 million budget. Despite critical pans for its implausible plot, Jolie's energetic performance and distinctive punk style contributed to the film's later cult status among tech enthusiasts.\n\nThroughout the mid-1990s, Jolie took on supporting parts in independent features, including *Without Evidence* (1995) as a drug addict opposite Scott Plank, *Foxfire* (1996) as Legs Sadovsky in an adaptation of Joyce Carol Oates' novel about female friendship, and *Mojave Moon* (1996) alongside Danny Aiello. These roles honed her ability to portray complex, often troubled young women, though the films achieved limited box office or critical success.\n\nJolie transitioned to television with notable acclaim in biographical dramas. In the 1997 Hallmark miniseries *True Women*, she depicted Georgia Virginia Lawshe, a pioneer woman, in a production based on Harryette Kerr's novel. Her portrayal of Cornelia Wallace, wife of segregationist governor George Wallace, in the TNT film *George Wallace* that same year earned her the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Series, Miniseries, or Television Film on January 18, 1998, highlighting her capacity for historical depth.\n\nFurther momentum built with *Playing God* (1997), a crime thriller where she starred as Claire opposite David Duchovny's disgraced surgeon, which received mixed reviews upon its October release. The HBO biopic *Gia* (1998), directed by Michael Cristofer, marked a pivotal transformation as supermodel Gia Carangi, depicting her rise, heroin addiction, and death from AIDS-related complications in 1986. Airing January 18, 1998, the film drew praise for Jolie's physical emulation—including gaining and losing weight—and emotional intensity, securing her the Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Miniseries or Television Film.\n\nJolie's definitive 1990s breakthrough arrived with *Girl, Interrupted* (1999), directed by James Mangold and adapted from Susanna Kaysen's memoir. As the charismatic sociopath Lisa Rowe in a psychiatric institution, she contrasted Winona Ryder's lead role, delivering a performance that blended menace and vulnerability. Released December 8, 1999, the film grossed over $91 million worldwide and prompted widespread recognition; Jolie won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress on March 26, 2000, along with a Screen Actors Guild Award, establishing her as a leading dramatic talent beyond action or indie fare.\n\n### Rise to Stardom and Blockbuster Era (2000s)\n\nFollowing her Academy Award-winning performance in *Girl, Interrupted* (1999), Jolie entered the blockbuster arena with the role of Sara \"Sway\" Wayland in *Gone in 60 Seconds* (2000), a high-octane car heist film co-starring Nicolas Cage. Released on June 9, 2000, the production grossed $237.2 million worldwide against a $90 million budget, ranking among the summer's top performers and marking Jolie's initial foray into wide-appeal commercial cinema.\n\nJolie's portrayal of the iconic video game heroine Lara Croft in *Lara Croft: Tomb Raider* (2001) propelled her to international superstardom, with the film earning $274.7 million globally on a $115 million budget despite predominantly negative critical reception. Directed by Simon West and released on June 15, 2001, it debuted at number one domestically with $47.7 million in its opening weekend, capitalizing on the franchise's gaming popularity to draw audiences. Critics faulted the script and effects, but Jolie's commitment to the physically demanding role—including extensive training in martial arts, shooting, and climbing—was widely acknowledged as a highlight, solidifying her image as a capable action lead.\n\nThe 2003 sequel, *Lara Croft: Tomb Raider – The Cradle of Life*, generated $160.3 million worldwide but fell short of the original's returns, signaling diminishing franchise momentum. Interspersed with these were commercial setbacks, such as the erotic thriller *Original Sin* (2001) and romantic comedy *Life or Something Like It* (2002), both box-office disappointments that underscored the risks of diverging from action territory. In *Alexander* (2004), Jolie played Olympias opposite Colin Farrell's title character; the epic historical drama, budgeted at $155 million, recouped only $167.3 million globally, failing to meet financial expectations amid mixed reviews and multiple release versions.\n\nA major career resurgence came with *Mr. \\u0026 Mrs. Smith* (2005), where Jolie starred as Jane Smith, a covert assassin married unknowingly to another spy (Brad Pitt). The action-comedy, directed by Doug Liman and released on June 10, 2005, amassed $487.2 million worldwide on a $110 million budget, becoming one of the decade's highest-grossing films and elevating Jolie's marketability through its blend of stylish action and on-screen chemistry. Though critics were divided, its commercial dominance—fueled by strong international performance—reinforced her blockbuster draw. This success paved the way for further action vehicles, including *Wanted* (2008), in which she portrayed the enigmatic Fox; the film grossed $342.5 million against a $75 million budget, praised for its kinetic visuals and Jolie's commanding presence in a supporting yet pivotal role.\n\nThroughout the 2000s, Jolie's pivot to high-profile action franchises and ensemble blockbusters transformed her from a critically acclaimed indie performer into a global box-office force, with her films collectively contributing to over $1.5 billion in worldwide earnings during the decade, though not without variability in critical and financial outcomes. Her willingness to embrace physically rigorous roles distinguished her amid Hollywood's action landscape, prioritizing spectacle and star power over consistent acclaim.\n\n### Awards, Critical Roles, and Versatility (2000s–2010s)\n\nIn the 2000s, Angelina Jolie achieved commercial success with action-oriented roles that highlighted her physicality and screen presence, such as Evelyn Salt in *Salt* (2010), a CIA operative accused of treason, and Jane Smith in *Mr. \\u0026 Mrs. Smith* (2005), a spy in a combative marriage. These films demonstrated her appeal in high-stakes thrillers, earning her popularity-based accolades including People's Choice Awards for Favorite Female Action Movie Star in 2006 and 2015, reflecting audience preference over critical consensus.\n\nJolie's dramatic performances garnered critical recognition, particularly as Christine Collins in *Changeling* (2008), directed by Clint Eastwood, where she portrayed a mother fighting corruption after her son's abduction; the role earned her an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress in 2009, along with a Golden Globe nomination. Similarly, in *A Mighty Heart* (2007), she played Mariane Pearl, the wife of murdered journalist Daniel Pearl, receiving praise for conveying restrained grief amid crisis, with reviewers like Roger Ebert noting her \"riveting performance that relies on inner conviction.\" These roles contrasted her earlier action work, underscoring versatility through shifts from adrenaline-fueled sequences to nuanced emotional depth.\n\n| Film                  | Award/Nomination                  | Year | Outcome     |\n|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|------|-------------|\n| *Changeling* (2008)  | Academy Award, Best Actress      | 2009 | Nominated   |\n| *Changeling* (2008)  | Golden Globe, Best Actress – Drama | 2009 | Nominated   |\n| *Mr. \\u0026 Mrs. Smith* (2005) | People's Choice, Favorite Female Action Star | 2006 | Won        |\n| *Salt* (2010)        | MTV Movie Award, Best Female Performance | 2011 | Nominated   |\n\nFurther evidencing range, Jolie voiced Tigress in the animated *Kung Fu Panda* series starting in 2008, blending martial arts expertise with voice acting, while *Maleficent* (2014) allowed her to reinterpret a villainous fairy tale figure with layers of vulnerability, contributing to the film's global earnings but prioritizing character complexity over prior formulaic action. Despite no additional major competitive wins beyond popularity honors, her selective projects in the 2010s, like the self-directed *By the Sea* (2015), affirmed adaptability across genres, though critics often noted uneven reception for more personal endeavors.\n\n### Directing, Producing, and Career Shifts (2010s–Present)\n\nAngelina Jolie made her feature-length directorial debut in 2011 with *In the Land of Blood and Honey*, a war drama she also wrote and produced, depicting a forbidden romance amid the Bosnian War between 1992 and 1995. The film premiered at the Sarajevo Film Festival and received a limited U.S. theatrical release on December 23, 2011, earning mixed critical reception with a 57% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 79 reviews.\n\nIn 2014, Jolie directed *Unbroken*, a biographical war film about Olympian and World War II prisoner of war Louis Zamperini, produced on a $65 million budget and grossing $161 million worldwide. The project, which she developed for seven years, garnered a 53% Rotten Tomatoes score from 230 reviews, praised for cinematography by Roger Deakins but critiqued for pacing. Her next directorial effort, *By the Sea* (2015), a marital drama starring Jolie and Brad Pitt set in 1970s France, received more negative reviews, holding a 35% Rotten Tomatoes rating from 155 reviews and underperforming commercially.\n\nJolie continued directing with *First They Killed My Father* (2017), a Khmer-language adaptation of Loung Ung's memoir about a child's survival under the Khmer Rouge regime, released exclusively on Netflix and earning an 88% Rotten Tomatoes approval from 74 reviews for its sensitive portrayal. In 2024, she directed *Without Blood*, a parable on war, revenge, and memory starring Salma Hayek and Demián Bichir, adapted from Alessandro Baricco's novel and premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival; it holds a 36% Rotten Tomatoes score from 14 reviews. Jolie has produced several of her directorial works and others addressing human rights, such as *Difret* (2014) on Ethiopian female genital mutilation and *The Breadwinner* (2017), an animated feature about an Afghan girl under Taliban rule.\n\nThroughout the 2010s and into the present, Jolie shifted focus from acting in high-profile blockbusters to directing and producing, citing the form's capacity for in-depth storytelling on conflict and resilience, though noting its two-year-plus time demands compared to acting. In a 2014 interview, she expressed intent to prioritize directing over acting due to its creative fulfillment. Family circumstances, including her 2016 separation from Brad Pitt and ensuing custody disputes, prompted a temporary emphasis on shorter acting commitments to prioritize home life, but she has sustained directorial output, stating in 2024 that *Without Blood* marks her final war-themed film. Through her production banner Jolie Pas, she has optioned projects like *Catherine the Great \\u0026 Potemkin* for adaptation.\n\n### Box Office and Critical Failures\n\n*Original Sin* (2001), an erotic thriller in which Jolie starred opposite Antonio Banderas, failed both commercially and critically; produced on a $42 million budget, it earned $16.5 million domestically and received a 12% Rotten Tomatoes score from 91 reviews. Similarly, *Life or Something Like It* (2002), her romantic comedy vehicle, grossed $16.9 million worldwide against a $40 million budget and garnered a 28% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 120 reviews. *Beyond Borders* (2003), portraying aid worker Nick Callahan's colleague, underperformed with $11.7 million in global earnings from an estimated $35 million budget and a 14% Rotten Tomatoes score from 102 critics.\n\nThe epic *Alexander* (2004), featuring Jolie as Olympias, incurred substantial losses despite a $167 million worldwide gross against its $155 million production budget—insufficient after marketing and distribution costs—and earned a 15% Rotten Tomatoes rating from 201 reviews, with critics citing its ponderous pacing and emotional distance. *The Tourist* (2010), co-starring Johnny Depp, achieved profitability at $278 million worldwide from a roughly $100 million outlay but disappointed domestically with $67.6 million and faced critical disdain, scoring 21% on Rotten Tomatoes from 170 reviews for its perceived lack of tension and chemistry.\n\nJolie's directorial and writing debut *By the Sea* (2015), starring herself and Brad Pitt, was a box office disappointment, generating $3.3 million globally against a $10 million budget and receiving a 35% Rotten Tomatoes score from 155 reviews. *Come Away* (2020), a fantasy drama, fared worse with under $1.7 million in worldwide receipts and a 29% critics' score on Rotten Tomatoes from 69 reviews, reflecting limited theatrical appeal amid pandemic constraints. These projects highlight instances where high expectations, ambitious scopes, or niche appeals did not translate to audience or critical success, contrasting Jolie's more lucrative action and franchise roles.\n\n## Humanitarian Efforts and Activism\n\n### UNHCR Involvement and Refugee Advocacy\n\nAngelina Jolie first engaged with UNHCR operations through personal visits to refugee camps in countries including Sierra Leone, Tanzania, and Pakistan in early 2001, which prompted her formal involvement with the organization. On August 27, 2001, she was appointed as a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador in Geneva, tasked with raising awareness about the plight of refugees worldwide. In this role, spanning from 2001 to 2012, Jolie conducted over 40 field missions across more than 30 countries, meeting directly with millions of refugees and internally displaced persons to highlight their conditions and advocate for international support.\n\nAs Goodwill Ambassador, Jolie focused on amplifying refugee voices through public campaigns and media engagement, including UNHCR's 2012 World Refugee Day initiative \"Dilemmas,\" which addressed xenophobia and intolerance toward refugees via social advocacy. Her visits included high-profile trips to camps such as Jordan's Za'atri settlement in 2013, where she met Syrian refugees alongside UNHCR High Commissioner António Guterres, urging greater global responsibility sharing for the growing displacement crisis. She also advocated for increased funding and policy reforms, emphasizing the need for host countries like Turkey, which sheltered millions of Syrians by 2015, to receive adequate international aid.\n\nIn April 2012, Jolie transitioned to the role of UNHCR Special Envoy to High Commissioner António Guterres, an elevated position enabling higher-level diplomatic engagement on global refugee issues. This expansion allowed her to represent UNHCR in executive-level discussions, including visits to conflict zones like Yemen in 2022, where she met displaced families and called for conflict resolution to halt human suffering. Other activities included trips to Iraq's Mosul in 2018 to assess post-liberation recovery for displaced populations and Pakistan in 2022 to spotlight flood-affected refugees amid climate challenges. Through these efforts, spanning over two decades, Jolie has consistently pressed for systemic solutions to displacement, including better protection against gender-based violence in refugee settings.\n\n### Conservation, Education, and Global Causes\n\nJolie has supported wildlife conservation in Cambodia since the early 2000s, including the purchase of 60,000 hectares of land in Keo Seima district in 2003 to convert former hunting grounds into a protected area, fostering anti-poaching efforts and community involvement in preservation. Her foundation has invested in environmental projects there for over 17 years, addressing deforestation and illegal logging through local partnerships. In 2023, she endorsed Cambodia's \"Zero Snaring\" campaign on social media, promoting full participation in wildlife protection to halt poaching.\n\nShe has advocated for pollinator conservation, serving as \"godmother\" to UNESCO's Women for Bees program since 2021, which trains women beekeepers globally to bolster biodiversity and rural economies. This includes backing Guerlain's decade-long bee conservation initiative and appearing in the 2025 documentary *Bee Wild* to highlight ecosystem threats.  On elephant protection, Jolie planned to direct *Africa* in 2014, a film about anti-poaching efforts inspired by conservationists combating ivory trade, though the project did not materialize.\n\nIn education philanthropy, Jolie co-chairs the Education Partnership for Children of Conflict, funding programs for war-affected youth since its founding. Through personal donations, she established a girls' boarding school in Kenya's Kakuma camp in 2005 and supported two primary schools for girls in Afghanistan, emphasizing access amid instability. Her Maddox Jolie-Pitt Foundation, launched in 2003, targets poverty alleviation and educational infrastructure in Cambodia, including health and schooling for rural children. In 2021, she collaborated with Amnesty International on *Know Your Rights and Claim Them*, a guide teaching children about legal protections, including education rights, distributed in multiple languages.\n\nFor broader global causes, Jolie co-launched the Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative (PSVI) in 2012 with UK Foreign Secretary William Hague, aiming to end wartime sexual abuse through policy advocacy, training, and prosecution support in conflict zones.  The initiative hosted summits, including the 2014 Global Summit to End Sexual Violence in Conflict, attended by over 120 countries' representatives. She has also backed the Jolie-Pitt Foundation's work on orphaned children's support via the 2007 Global Action for Children program, providing aid in developing nations.\n\n### Effectiveness, Criticisms, and Unintended Consequences\n\nJolie's humanitarian advocacy with UNHCR, spanning over two decades, has centered on field visits to more than 60 crisis zones and public campaigns emphasizing refugee protection, education access, and prevention of gender-based violence. These efforts, including appeals for increased funding during crises in Yemen and Pakistan, have been credited by UNHCR with amplifying global attention to underfunded responses, though direct causal links to funding surges or policy shifts remain unquantified in independent assessments.  Her role as Special Envoy facilitated joint statements urging international action, such as prosecuting conflict-related sexual violence, potentially influencing diplomatic priorities. However, UNHCR's endorsements, as a partner institution, may reflect institutional incentives to highlight celebrity contributions rather than rigorous outcome evaluations.\n\nCriticisms of Jolie's work often portray it as emblematic of celebrity activism's limitations, where high-visibility endorsements risk trivializing complex geopolitical issues through personalized narratives and media spectacles. Commentators have dismissed her engagements as extensions of personal vanity, citing instances like publicized emotional displays in magazines as performative rather than substantive, potentially diverting focus from local experts and systemic reforms. Her initial appointment as Goodwill Ambassador in 2001 drew skepticism regarding her expertise, with detractors arguing that unelected celebrities undermine professional diplomacy. Jolie's departure from UNHCR in December 2022, motivated by frustrations with institutional inertia, underscored her critiques of global responses but also highlighted tensions between celebrity influence and bureaucratic efficacy.\n\nUnintended consequences of her activism include the overshadowing of refugee advocacy by personal scandals, such as her 2016-2019 divorce from Brad Pitt, which commentators argue tarnished UNHCR's credibility and shifted public discourse from humanitarian needs to tabloid drama. High-profile visits, while boosting short-term media coverage, have been faulted for fostering dependency on transient celebrity attention rather than sustainable local capacity-building, with broader celebrity diplomacy critiques suggesting it oversimplifies causes and sidelines grassroots efforts. Empirical evaluations of such interventions remain sparse, but analogous cases indicate risks of policy distortions favoring visible crises over structural prevention.\n\n## Personal Life\n\n### Relationships, Marriages, and Affairs\n\nAngelina Jolie has been married three times, with each union marked by rapid developments and subsequent separations. Her first marriage was to British actor Jonny Lee Miller, whom she met while filming *Hackers* in 1995. The couple wed in a small civil ceremony on March 28, 1996, in Los Angeles, where Jolie wore black leather pants and Miller had her name written in her blood on his shirt. They separated after approximately 18 months due to conflicting acting schedules and divorced in 1999, maintaining an amicable relationship thereafter.\n\nJolie's second marriage, to actor Billy Bob Thornton, began after they met on the set of *Pushing Tin* in 1999. The pair announced their engagement unexpectedly at the 2000 Golden Globe Awards and married impulsively on May 5, 2000, in Las Vegas. Their relationship gained notoriety for its intensity, including wearing vials of each other's blood as necklaces, but ended amid personal differences; Thornton later attributed the 2003 divorce to his insecurities and Jolie's growing focus on humanitarian work. The divorce was finalized on May 27, 2003, after which both described the split as mutual and without acrimony.\n\nJolie's most publicized relationship was with actor Brad Pitt, which originated during the 2004 filming of *Mr. \\u0026 Mrs. Smith*, while Pitt was still married to Jennifer Aniston. Although Pitt and Jolie insisted their romance did not begin until after Pitt's January 2005 separation from Aniston—with their divorce finalized in October 2005—the close timing fueled accusations of an affair and tabloid portrayals of Jolie as a marriage breaker, despite their denials. The couple, dubbed \"Brangelina,\" went public in 2005 with photos from Kenya, became engaged in 2012, and married in two ceremonies on August 23, 2014, in France. They separated in September 2016, with Jolie filing for divorce citing irreconcilable differences; the contentious proceedings concluded in 2019.\n\nJolie has publicly identified as bisexual, stating in interviews her attraction to both men and women, including \"I genuinely love other women.\" Prior to her marriages, her early romantic life included limited public details, such as a teenage relationship, and a confirmed romantic involvement with actress Jenny Shimizu during the 1996 filming of *Foxfire*, where she stated, \"I fell in love with her the first second I saw her\" and \"I would probably have married Jenny Shimizu if I hadn't married my first husband.\" This overlapped with her marriage to Miller but was not exclusive. No other verified long-term affairs beyond these high-profile partnerships have been substantiated in credible accounts.\n### Children, Adoptions, and Family Dynamics\n\nAngelina Jolie has six children: three adopted from Cambodia, Ethiopia, and Vietnam, and three biological children born during her relationship with actor Brad Pitt. The adoptions began prior to her marriage to Pitt, with Jolie initially acting as a single parent, reflecting her early humanitarian interests in supporting orphaned children from conflict zones.\n\nHer eldest child, Maddox Chivan Jolie-Pitt, was born on August 5, 2001, in Cambodia and adopted by Jolie on March 10, 2002, while she was filming *Lara Croft: Tomb Raider* in the region; initial reports questioned the adoption's paperwork due to the biological father's brief claim of paternity, but Cambodian authorities finalized it legally. Zahara Marley Jolie-Pitt, born January 8, 2005, in Ethiopia, was adopted by Jolie on July 6, 2005, at six months old, following a visit inspired by Maddox's interest in Africa; the process faced delays over HIV testing requirements but was completed without noted irregularities. Pax Thien Jolie-Pitt, born November 29, 2003, in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, was adopted in 2007 at age three after spending time in a local orphanage; Vietnam's single-parent adoption ban at the time required Jolie's lawyer to argue her case successfully, amid broader scrutiny of celebrity international adoptions potentially incentivizing orphanages over family reunifications.\n\nThe biological children include Shiloh Nouvel Jolie-Pitt, born May 27, 2006, in Swakopmund, Namibia, where the couple sought privacy to avoid paparazzi; she was the first biological child for both. Twins Knox Léon Jolie-Pitt and Vivienne Marcheline Jolie-Pitt were born on July 12, 2008, via cesarean section in Nice, France, weighing 2.51 kg and 2.49 kg respectively; Vivienne later collaborated with Jolie on the Broadway adaptation of *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* in 2021, and Knox has pursued modeling.\n\n| Child              | Type       | Birth/Adoption Date | Origin/Details                          |\n|--------------------|------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| Maddox Chivan     | Adopted   | March 10, 2002     | Cambodia; born August 5, 2001          |\n| Zahara Marley     | Adopted   | July 6, 2005       | Ethiopia; born January 8, 2005         |\n| Shiloh Nouvel     | Biological| May 27, 2006       | Born in Namibia                        |\n| Pax Thien         | Adopted   | 2007               | Vietnam; born November 29, 2003        |\n| Knox Léon \\u0026 Vivienne Marcheline | Biological | July 12, 2008 | Twins born in France                   |\n\nFollowing Jolie's September 2016 divorce filing from Pitt—citing irreconcilable differences after an alleged onboard plane incident involving alcohol and physical altercations witnessed by the children—a Los Angeles court granted her primary physical custody in 2018, with Pitt receiving visitation rights amid ongoing disputes over child support and the family's Miraval wine estate. The prolonged litigation, finalized in asset division by December 2024 but with custody elements lingering, has strained parent-child relations, with reports indicating Pitt's limited contact with the children; Maddox refused to film a movie with him in 2023, and Pax publicly labeled Pitt an \"abusive\" figure in a 2020 Instagram post (later deleted), echoing allegations from the divorce. Multiple older children—Maddox, Zahara, and Shiloh—have legally or informally dropped \"Pitt\" from their names by 2024, signaling alignment with Jolie amid claims from Pitt's side that she has alienated them, though no court has substantiated parental alienation.\n\nJolie's family dynamics extend to her estrangement from father Jon Voight, stemming from his 1976 separation and 1980 divorce from her mother, Marcheline Bertrand, due to Voight's admitted infidelity, which Jolie cited as causing lasting emotional harm; she briefly reconciled with him in 2007 after Bertrand's death from ovarian cancer, allowing limited grandfather-grandchild interactions, but relations soured by the 2010s over political divergences, with Voight publicly criticizing Jolie's views as \"unhinged\" and her parenting as disconnected from reality. Voight has expressed regret over the rift's impact on access to his grandchildren, whom he has met sporadically, while Jolie has prioritized shielding her children from familial conflicts, fostering their independence in education and careers—Maddox in filmmaking, Zahara in college, and others in creative pursuits.\n\n### Health Challenges and Preventive Surgeries\n\nIn 2013, Angelina Jolie disclosed that she carried a mutation in the BRCA1 gene, inherited from her family, which her physicians estimated conferred an 87 percent lifetime risk of breast cancer and a 50 percent risk of ovarian cancer. This mutation was identified amid a family history marked by her mother Marcheline Bertrand's death from ovarian cancer in 2007 at age 56, as well as breast cancer deaths of her grandmother and aunt. \n\nOn May 14, 2013, Jolie announced in a *New York Times* op-ed that she had undergone a preventive bilateral mastectomy over three months earlier, removing both breasts and replacing them with reconstructive implants to reduce her breast cancer risk to under 5 percent. The procedure involved nipple-sparing techniques and immediate reconstruction, which she described as emotionally challenging but empowering given the genetic risks. Her public revelation, termed the \"Angelina Jolie effect,\" correlated with a temporary surge in BRCA testing and risk-reducing mastectomies among women, though long-term adherence to guidelines remained variable.\n\nIn March 2015, Jolie underwent a laparoscopic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy to preempt ovarian cancer risk, prompted by elevated cancer antigen 125 (CA-125) levels detected in routine blood tests that initially raised concerns for early-stage malignancy. The surgery removed her ovaries and fallopian tubes, revealing only a small benign tumor and no evidence of cancer, but it induced surgical menopause, causing symptoms such as hot flashes and necessitating hormone replacement therapy.  This step further lowered her ovarian cancer risk, aligning with medical recommendations for BRCA1 carriers post-childbearing age, though it accelerated risks associated with estrogen deprivation, including bone density loss.\n\n### Recent Divorce, Custody Battles, and Lifestyle Changes\n\nAngelina Jolie filed for divorce from Brad Pitt on September 20, 2016, citing irreconcilable differences, shortly after an alleged altercation on a private jet involving Pitt and their eldest son, Maddox; the FBI investigated the incident but brought no charges. The couple, who married in 2014 after a decade-long relationship, share six children: Maddox (adopted 2002), Pax (adopted 2007), Zahara (adopted 2005), Shiloh (born 2006), and twins Knox and Vivienne (born 2008). Pitt countersued for joint custody, but a temporary ruling in 2016 granted Jolie primary physical custody with supervised visitation for Pitt amid abuse allegations, which he denied; the case dragged on due to disputes over child welfare evaluations and Pitt's winery assets at Château Miraval.\n\nCustody battles intensified with Jolie's claims of Pitt's abusive behavior, including the 2016 plane incident, leading to adult children—Maddox, Pax, and Zahara—publicly distancing themselves from Pitt by 2024, with reports of strained relations and some dropping his surname. Shiloh, upon turning 18 in May 2024, petitioned to legally remove \"Pitt\" from her name, citing personal reasons without public elaboration, while twins Knox and Vivienne maintained lower profiles. Pitt reportedly ceased financial support to two adult children in June 2025, viewing reconciliation as unlikely amid the protracted litigation. In March 2024, Pitt abandoned his push for shared custody of the minors, and the divorce finalized on December 30, 2024, restoring them to single status without public terms on assets or custody, though joint legal custody persisted for the twins. Separate winery litigation continued into 2025, with Jolie seeking $33,000 in legal fees from Pitt in October over NDA disputes tied to the property sale.\n\nPost-divorce, Jolie described the process as \"traumatic\" and \"emotionally difficult,\" forgoing alimony and relinquishing claims to family homes in Los Angeles and Miraval to prioritize stability for her children, whom she credited with urging her to defend herself publicly. She shifted to shorter-term acting roles to remain home-focused, emphasizing family healing after a period where she \"lost the ability to live happily,\" and sold the Los Angeles residence in 2024. By August 2025, with the twins nearing 18 and custody restrictions lifting, Jolie planned to relocate abroad, potentially to Cambodia, citing an \"unrecognizable\" America and a desire for privacy, while her children pursued independent paths, including Shiloh's move out in late 2024.\n\n## Controversies and Public Scrutiny\n\n### Early Self-Destructive Behaviors and Mental Health\n\nIn her teenage years, Angelina Jolie experimented extensively with drugs, including cocaine and heroin, which she later attributed to underlying depression that began during adolescence. At age 14, her mother permitted her boyfriend to move into their home, reflecting a permissive environment amid the ongoing estrangement from her father, Jon Voight, following their parents' divorce. Jolie dropped out of Beverly Hills High School due to bullying and social alienation, subsequently attending the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute and an alternative high school for at-risk youth, where her self-destructive patterns intensified.\n\nJolie has publicly described engaging in self-harm by cutting herself with knives during her teens and early twenties as a means to cope with emotional numbness and prove she could feel pain, often linked to an obsession with death and mortality. These behaviors were compounded by severe depression, which she connected to familial instability and personal identity struggles, leading to periods of isolation and risky actions beyond substance abuse.\n\nBy age 22, Jolie's mental health deteriorated to the point of suicidal ideation, prompting her to attempt hiring a hitman to stage her death as a murder, reasoning that it would spare her family grief and allow them insurance benefits; the individual she approached instead dissuaded her from proceeding. This incident, which she later recounted in interviews, marked a low point before she sought therapy and quit drugs, though she has noted that depression recurred episodically into adulthood. Despite these admissions, Jolie has emphasized personal agency in overcoming such challenges without formal diagnoses publicized beyond self-reported depression.\n\n### High-Profile Feuds and Legal Disputes\n\nAngelina Jolie's relationship with her father, actor Jon Voight, deteriorated publicly in the early 2000s following her divorce from Billy Bob Thornton in 2003. Voight publicly suggested Jolie might have mental health issues, including possible bipolar disorder, prompting her to legally drop \"Voight\" from her name and return the Academy Award statuette he had given her as a child. The feud stemmed partly from Voight's infidelity, which led to his 1976 separation and 1980 divorce from Jolie's mother, Marcheline Bertrand, causing lasting family rift. Despite a partial reconciliation in 2010 facilitated by then-husband Brad Pitt, their relationship remained strained, with Jolie reportedly never fully forgiving Voight for breaking her mother's heart, and sources indicating they were not on good terms as of 2024.\n\nJolie's most protracted legal disputes arose from her 2016 divorce from Brad Pitt. She filed for divorce on September 20, 2016, citing irreconcilable differences, shortly after an alleged altercation on a private plane involving Pitt and their son Maddox, which prompted child services investigations but resulted in no criminal charges against Pitt. A temporary custody agreement granted Jolie primary physical custody with Pitt receiving visitation, while both underwent counseling; the custody battle extended over years amid mutual accusations.\n\nThe couple's asset division fueled further litigation centered on their co-owned French winery, Château Miraval. Jolie sold her 50% stake in 2021 to Tenute del Mondo, a subsidiary of the Stoli Group, for approximately $164 million; Pitt sued in February 2022, alleging breach of contract and violation of an informal right of first refusal, seeking to invalidate the sale or damages exceeding $500 million. Jolie countered that no binding agreement prevented the sale and described the divorce period as \"traumatic\" due to \"painful events,\" including claims of Pitt's abusive behavior, though she has not returned to the property since. While the divorce was finalized on December 30, 2024, after eight years, the winery dispute persisted into 2025, with Pitt seeking access to Jolie's private emails and Jolie requesting reimbursement for $33,000 in legal fees related to a non-disclosure agreement dispute.\n\n### Accusations of Performative Activism and Cultural Insensitivity\n\nCritics have accused Angelina Jolie of engaging in performative activism, portraying her humanitarian efforts—such as her role as a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador since 2001 and subsequent visits to refugee camps in over 40 countries—as publicity-driven endeavors that prioritize personal branding over substantive impact. Academic analyses describe her advocacy as emblematic of \"celebrity humanitarianism,\" where high-profile interventions, including adoptions and policy op-eds, amplify a white savior narrative that reinforces Western paternalism rather than addressing root causes like systemic poverty or conflict. For instance, her 2005 adoption of Zahara from Ethiopia was cited as sparking a trend among Western celebrities and affluent parents, potentially inflating demand in vulnerable adoption systems without equivalent scrutiny of local family preservation efforts.\n\nThese accusations extend to cultural insensitivity, particularly in Jolie's adoptions from Cambodia, Ethiopia, and Vietnam, which detractors argue commodify children from conflict-affected regions while overlooking cultural disconnection and ethical lapses in international processes. Her 2002 adoption of Maddox from a Cambodian orphanage occurred amid widespread child trafficking concerns, prompting Cambodia to suspend foreign adoptions multiple times in the 2000s; a 2017 scandal revealed that an aid worker had falsified documents by listing himself as Maddox's father to facilitate the process, raising questions about due diligence. Similarly, the 2007 adoption of Pax from Vietnam followed a visit where ethical sourcing was scrutinized, with critics labeling such practices as insensitive to the children's heritage and prone to exploitation.\n\nJolie's directorial projects have drawn further charges of insensitivity. During the 2010 filming of *In the Land of Blood and Honey*, which depicts the Bosnian War including scenes of mass rape, Bosnian women's groups protested the production for mishandling survivor testimonies and cultural nuances, leading to a temporary halt in shooting after accusations of exploiting trauma for Hollywood narrative. In 2017, a *Vanity Fair* profile of her film *First They Killed My Father*—about the Khmer Rouge era—detailed casting methods involving Cambodian orphans reenacting distress to select actors, described as a \"disturbing\" game-like process; Jolie rejected the account as \"false and upsetting,\" but it fueled perceptions of retraumatizing vulnerable children for artistic ends. Such incidents underscore broader critiques that her global causes, while raising awareness, risk superficial engagement with non-Western traumas.\n\n## Reception and Legacy\n\n### Evolving Public Image and Media Portrayal\n\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, media outlets frequently portrayed Angelina Jolie as a provocative and self-destructive figure, emphasizing scandals such as her 2000 on-stage kiss with brother James Haven at the Academy Awards and her admission of wearing a vial of his blood as a necklace. This coverage reinforced her \"wild child\" image from roles in films like *Gia* (1998), where she depicted a heroin-addicted model, contributing to perceptions of her as a hedonistic rebel rather than a serious actress.\n\nJolie's public image began shifting with her casting as Lara Croft in *Lara Croft: Tomb Raider* (2001), transforming her into a global sex symbol and action heroine, which media highlighted through focus on her physicality and glamorous style, including form-fitting outfits and adventurous persona. This phase marked a commercial peak but still carried echoes of earlier edginess, with outlets like *Page Six* chronicling her evolving looks from retro curls to caramel highlights as emblematic of assertive modernity.\n\nA pivotal evolution occurred in 2001 when Jolie was appointed UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador on February 27, prompting media narratives to pivot toward her humanitarian commitments, including visits to over 20 refugee-impacted countries like Sierra Leone amid its civil war. Outlets such as *TIME* described this as a \"public-image turnaround\" from \"laughing stock\" to lauded activist, crediting her field missions and advocacy for refugees as authentic drivers of the change, though some coverage noted the strategic timing amid personal controversies. By 2012, her promotion to Special Envoy further solidified this portrayal, with emphasis on initiatives against sexual violence in conflict zones.\n\nIn the 2010s, Jolie's image matured into that of a maternal advocate and director, influenced by her 2013 preventive double mastectomy due to BRCA1 mutation, which media framed as empowering and humanizing, shifting focus from sex appeal to resilience and health awareness. Post-2016 divorce from Brad Pitt, coverage turned toward her as a protective mother amid custody battles, with *Grazia* quoting her on prioritizing family over likability, reflecting a more private, introspective persona less reliant on Hollywood glamour. Recent analyses, including at the 2025 Toronto International Film Festival, highlight a style evolution to understated elegance, symbolizing her departure from \"shock factor\" tactics. This progression has drawn admiration from women for her activist-mother archetype, though earlier male-centric appeal waned as humanitarian efforts dominated her narrative.\n\n### Critical and Commercial Evaluation\n\nAngelina Jolie's acting career has generated substantial commercial success, with her films collectively grossing over $6.4 billion worldwide as of 2023. Her portrayal of Maleficent in the 2014 fantasy film of the same name marked her highest-grossing project, earning $758.5 million globally and establishing her as a draw for family-oriented blockbusters. Other major earners include *Mr. \\u0026 Mrs. Smith* (2005) at $478 million and *Maleficent: Mistress of Evil* (2019) at approximately $491 million, reflecting her appeal in action and fantasy genres that prioritize spectacle over narrative depth. Voice roles in the *Kung Fu Panda* series further boosted her box office totals, contributing hundreds of millions from animated features.\n\nCritically, Jolie's reception has been uneven, with acclaim concentrated in dramatic roles showcasing emotional intensity rather than action-heavy leads. She won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her portrayal of Lisa Rowe in *Girl, Interrupted* (1999), a performance lauded for its raw depiction of mental instability. Nominations followed for *Changeling* (2008), where her role as a mother fighting institutional corruption earned praise for vulnerability, though the film itself divided reviewers. Action vehicles like *Lara Croft: Tomb Raider* (2001) and *Salt* (2010) often received middling reviews, with critics noting physical prowess but critiquing limited character development.\n\nJolie's three Golden Globe wins— for *George Wallace* (1998), *Girl, Interrupted*, and *Beowulf* (2007)—underscore her versatility in television, drama, and voice work, yet sustained critical consensus on her as a leading dramatic actress remains elusive. Recent projects, such as *Maria* (2024), have prompted early praise for a \"career-best\" performance as Maria Callas, suggesting potential resurgence in prestige roles amid a shift from commercial blockbusters. Overall, her commercial dominance has outpaced consistent critical elevation, positioning her as a bankable star whose humanitarian profile often amplifies media coverage beyond artistic merit.\n\n| Film | Worldwide Gross (USD) | Critical Notes |\n|------|-----------------------|---------------|\n| *Maleficent* (2014) | $758.5 million | Commercial hit; mixed reviews for reimagining. |\n| *Mr. \\u0026 Mrs. Smith* (2005) | $478 million | Box office success; chemistry praised over depth. |\n| *Girl, Interrupted* (1999) | $46 million (modest) | Oscar win; strong critical acclaim for performance. |\n\n### Cultural Impact and Broader Influence\n\nAngelina Jolie's portrayal of Lara Croft in *Lara Croft: Tomb Raider* (2001) marked a significant crossover from video games to cinema, grossing over $274 million worldwide and establishing her as a leading action star while influencing adaptations of gaming properties in Hollywood. Her role amplified the character's cultural footprint, blending physicality and adventure tropes that resonated in early 2000s pop culture, with the film's success tied to her star power rather than source material fidelity alone.\n\nIn fashion, Jolie has shaped beauty standards through her distinctive features, such as full lips and angular structure, which challenged and reinforced Hollywood glamour ideals from the 1990s onward, evolving from rebellious aesthetics to tailored, neutral-toned elegance by the 2010s. Her 2023 launch of Atelier Jolie emphasized sustainable, upcycled clothing via a creative collective model, prioritizing tailors over stylists and reflecting a shift toward ethical production amid celebrity-driven trends. This initiative drew from her preference for simplicity, influencing discussions on accessible luxury without relying on high-volume fast fashion.\n\nJolie's humanitarian advocacy as UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador from 2001, involving over 60 field missions to more than 20 countries, elevated celebrity involvement in global issues, fostering a model where fame amplifies refugee narratives in media. She founded the Jolie Legal Services, providing free aid to unaccompanied immigrant minors, which by 2013 had assisted over 100 cases, though broader policy shifts attributable to her efforts remain indirect, often through heightened public awareness rather than legislated outcomes. Her work contributed to cultural perceptions of activism, yet critiques note reliance on personal branding over systemic change.\n\nThe \"Angelina Jolie effect\" emerged from her 2013 op-ed disclosing a preventive double mastectomy due to BRCA1 mutation risk, spurring a 2.5-fold increase in U.S. genetic testing referrals within months and elevated mastectomy rates among carriers, demonstrating celebrity disclosures' capacity to drive medical behavior empirically. This influence extended to preventive surgeries, with studies documenting sustained uptake in awareness and procedures post-announcement, though not without debates on over-medicalization. Overall, Jolie's trajectory from edgy icon to multifaceted advocate has modeled hybrid celebrity roles, impacting how fame intersects with policy, health, and style in public discourse.",
