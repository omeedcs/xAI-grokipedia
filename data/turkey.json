Straddling the Bosphorus Strait, it is uniquely positioned with a small portion of its territory in southeastern Europe (East Thrace) and the majority in western Asia (Anatolia). Turkey shares borders with eight countries: Greece and Bulgaria to the northwest, Georgia, Armenia, and Iran to the northeast and east, and Iraq and Syria to the south. Its capital is Ankara, while Istanbul, the largest city, serves as a major cultural and economic hub. With a population of approximately 85 million as of 2023, Turkey is a significant regional power with a rich history that spans millennia, influencing both Eastern and Western civilizations [CIA World Factbook](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/turkey/).\n\nTurkey is a secular, unitary, parliamentary republic established in 1923 following the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire. It is a member of international organizations such as NATO, the United Nations, and the G20, and has been a candidate for European Union membership since 1999. The country’s strategic location, diverse culture, and dynamic economy make it a pivotal player in global affairs [BBC Country Profile](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-17988453).\n\n## Historical Background\n\nTurkey’s history is one of the most extensive and complex in the world, shaped by its position as a bridge between continents. The region of Anatolia, which constitutes most of modern Turkey, has been inhabited since prehistoric times, with evidence of early settlements like Göbekli Tepe dating back to around 9600 BCE, making it one of the oldest known human structures [UNESCO Göbekli Tepe](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1572/).\n\n### Ancient Civilizations\nAnatolia was home to several ancient civilizations, including the Hittites (circa 1600–1178 BCE), who established one of the first major empires in the region. Later, the area saw the rise of the Phrygians, Lydians, and Persians. The city of Troy, famous from Homer’s *Iliad*, is located in modern-day Turkey and dates to the Bronze Age [Encyclopedia Britannica - Anatolia](https://www.britannica.com/place/Anatolia).\n\nIn the 4th century BCE, Alexander the Great conquered much of the region, ushering in the Hellenistic period. Following his death, Anatolia became part of various successor states until it was incorporated into the Roman Empire by the 1st century BCE. The city of Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul), founded by Emperor Constantine I in 330 CE, became the capital of the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire and a center of Christian culture for nearly a millennium [History.com - Byzantine Empire](https://www.history.com/topics/ancient-middle-east/byzantine-empire).\n\n### Ottoman Empire\nThe Seljuk Turks, a Turkic people, began migrating into Anatolia in the 11th century, culminating in the establishment of the Ottoman Empire in 1299 under Osman I. The empire expanded rapidly, capturing Constantinople in 1453 under Sultan Mehmed II, marking the end of the Byzantine Empire. At its height in the 16th and 17th centuries under rulers like Suleiman the Magnificent, the Ottoman Empire spanned three continents, controlling much of Southeastern Europe, Western Asia, and North Africa. It was a major center of Islamic culture and governance [Encyclopedia Britannica - Ottoman Empire](https://www.britannica.com/place/Ottoman-Empire).\n\nThe empire began to decline in the 18th and 19th centuries due to internal strife, military losses, and European imperialism. Following its defeat in World War I as part of the Central Powers, the empire was partitioned by the Allied Powers under the Treaty of Sèvres in 1920 [BBC - Ottoman Empire End](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-17988453).\n\n### Founding of the Republic\nThe Turkish War of Independence (1919–1923), led by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, resulted in the abolition of the Ottoman sultanate in 1922 and the establishment of the Republic of Turkey on October 29, 1923. Atatürk, the first president, implemented sweeping reforms to modernize and secularize the nation, including the adoption of a Latin-based alphabet, legal and educational reforms, and the promotion of women’s rights. These reforms aimed to align Turkey with Western democratic and industrial models [Atatürk Reforms - Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Mustafa-Kemal-Ataturk/Ataturks-reforms).\n\n## Current Status and Relevance\n\nAs of 2023, Turkey remains a significant geopolitical player due to its strategic location and historical influence. It serves as a bridge between Europe and Asia, both physically and culturally, and controls key maritime routes like the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits, which connect the Black Sea to the Mediterranean [CIA World Factbook](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/turkey/).\n\n### Politics and Governance\nTurkey operates under a presidential system following a 2017 constitutional referendum that shifted power from a parliamentary to a presidential framework. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has been in power since 2003, first as prime minister and then as president since 2014. His tenure has been marked by economic growth but also criticism over democratic backsliding, restrictions on press freedom, and handling of minority rights, particularly concerning the Kurdish population [Freedom House - Turkey](https://freedomhouse.org/country/turkey/freedom-world/2023).\n\n### Economy\nTurkey has a mixed economy, classified as an emerging market by the International Monetary Fund. It is a major producer of agricultural goods, textiles, and automobiles, and has a growing tourism sector, with destinations like Istanbul, Cappadocia, and Antalya attracting millions annually. However, the country faces challenges such as inflation, currency depreciation, and unemployment, exacerbated by political instability and regional conflicts [World Bank - Turkey Overview](https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/turkey/overview).\n\n### International Relations\nTurkey is a NATO member since 1952 and plays a critical role in regional security, particularly in conflicts involving Syria, Iraq, and the Eastern Mediterranean. Its relationship with the European Union remains complex due to issues over human rights and migration policies, though it hosts millions of refugees, primarily from Syria [UNHCR - Turkey](https://www.unhcr.org/turkey). Turkey has also pursued an increasingly independent foreign policy, balancing relations with the West, Russia, and Middle Eastern states.\n\n## Notable Facts and Details\n\n- **Geography**: Turkey spans 783,562 square kilometers, with diverse landscapes including mountains, plains, and coastlines along the Aegean, Mediterranean, and Black Seas.
