# Berkeley

Berkeley is a city located in Alameda County on the eastern shore of San Francisco Bay in Northern California, United States, with a population of 124,321 according to the 2020 United States Census. Incorporated on April 4, 1878, it encompasses approximately 17.7 square miles of land and water, featuring a Mediterranean climate, urban flats along the bay, and hilly terrain rising to over 1,700 feet in the Berkeley Hills.

The city's defining institution is the University of California, Berkeley, established in 1868 as the original campus of the UC system and a public land-grant university that has driven population growth, economic activity, and cultural prominence since its founding. The university's research output includes affiliations with over 100 Nobel laureates and breakthroughs in fields like physics, chemistry, and computer science, contributing to Berkeley's reputation as an intellectual hub amid the Bay Area's innovation ecosystem.

Historically, Berkeley experienced rapid expansion after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, when many residents relocated across the bay, tripling its population between 1900 and 1910 through new rail infrastructure and university-driven development. It gained national attention in the 1960s as the epicenter of student-led protests, including the Free Speech Movement at UC Berkeley, which challenged administrative restrictions on political expression and presaged broader campus upheavals.

**Defining characteristics** include a politically progressive electorate that has implemented pioneering policies such as rent control in 1980 and early adoption of nuclear freeze resolutions, alongside a diverse economy anchored in education, biotechnology, and professional services, though challenged by high living costs and infrastructure strains from its 120,000-plus residents. Contemporary issues, including elevated property crime rates—reported at over 5,000 incidents annually in recent data—and persistent homelessness affecting thousands despite substantial municipal spending, reflect tensions between ideological commitments to equity and empirical outcomes in public safety and housing. These dynamics, often amplified in academic and media narratives favoring systemic critiques over individual agency, underscore Berkeley's role as a microcosm of causal trade-offs in policy experimentation.

## Places

### Australia

Berkeley is a suburb in the southern part of Wollongong, New South Wales, situated on the northern shore of Lake Illawarra in the Illawarra region. Originally part of a farming estate settled by Europeans in the early 19th century amid rainforest terrain, the area saw initial small-scale development including a public school by the late 1800s, but significant residential expansion occurred post-World War II as a planned suburb to house workers near nearby industrial sites such as the Port Kembla steelworks.

At the 2016 Australian census, Berkeley had a population of 7,605, which grew modestly to 7,798 by the 2021 census, reflecting steady but limited expansion in a predominantly residential community with proximity to Lake Illawarra's recreational foreshore. The suburb borders areas like Cringila to the south and Unanderra to the north, maintaining its role as a working-class enclave shaped by regional manufacturing history without major urban redevelopment in recent decades.

### Canada

Berkeley is an unincorporated rural community in the Township of Chatsworth, Grey County, southwestern Ontario, Canada, positioned along Ontario Highway 10 at the headwaters of the Styx River.

Settlement occurred amid the mid-19th-century expansion into the region's wilderness, with the Berkeley Post Office opening on an unspecified date in 1853, shortly after Grey County's provisional establishment in 1852 to organize land development and pioneer communities. The area transitioned from forested frontier to cleared farmland, supporting mixed agriculture including field crops and livestock as settlers cleared land for homesteads.

Historically centered on rural agriculture, Berkeley exemplified Grey County's 19th-century shift to farming-based economies, with early infrastructure like three churches—a Presbyterian, an Anglican, and a United—serving dispersed farm families. The community's small scale persists today, integrated into Chatsworth Township formed by 2001 amalgamation of former Holland and Sullivan townships with Chatsworth village.

### United Kingdom

Berkeley in Gloucestershire, England, is a civil parish and former market town whose name originates from the Old English *beorc lēah*, denoting a "birch meadow" or clearing associated with birch trees. The settlement was first documented in 824 CE as *Berclea*, reflecting its early Anglo-Saxon roots in the Vale of Berkeley, a low-lying area between the River Severn and Cotswold Hills. As a feudal manor, it exemplified the continuity of aristocratic land tenure under Norman and later English systems, with holdings centered on agricultural estates and manorial rights that persisted through medieval lordships into modern times.

Berkeley Castle, the village's dominant historical structure, was established circa 1067 as a motte-and-bailey fortification by William FitzOsbern, a Norman lord and companion of William the Conqueror, shortly after the 1066 Conquest to secure the Welsh Marches. By the mid-12th century, Robert Fitzharding, a Bristol merchant elevated to nobility, rebuilt it in stone under license from Henry II around 1153, marking the transition to a shell keep and domestic ranges typical of early Norman architecture adapted for residential use. The site gained notoriety as the place of imprisonment for King Edward II from 1327, where he died on September 21 amid suspicions of murder by associates including Roger Mortimer, though contemporary chronicles attribute it officially to illness.

The castle has remained the ancestral seat of the Berkeley family since the 12th century, with the male line maintaining possession through feudal inheritance, escheats, and legal disputes, underscoring the durability of English primogeniture and baronial estates. The family's tenure, documented from Maurice de Berkeley in the Domesday Book era onward, involved roles as Barons Berkeley and High Sheriffs of Gloucestershire, preserving the manor's economic base in demesne farming and rents amid shifts from feudalism to enclosure. The village itself, with a 2021 population of 2,252, retains medieval parish boundaries and church structures like St. Mary's, a 12th-century Norman edifice, highlighting unbroken continuity in rural Gloucestershire despite 20th-century industrial influences from nearby Severnside ports.

### United States

Berkeley, California, incorporated on April 4, 1878, is the most prominent U.S. locality named Berkeley, with a 2023 population estimate of 118,962. The city gained national attention during the 1964 Free Speech Movement at the University of California, Berkeley, where student protests against restrictions on political advocacy led to mass arrests and inspired broader campus activism across the United States. This era of countercultural influence has persisted in local governance, characterized by progressive policies including a $16.99 minimum wage in 2023 and strict rent controls, which correlate with elevated housing costs—a median home value of $1.35 million that year—and ongoing challenges like visible homelessness.

Property crime in Berkeley remains elevated compared to national averages, with residents facing a 1 in 14 chance of victimization based on recent analyses, though overall reported crimes declined in 2024 amid national trends. Such patterns trace partly to state-level reforms like Proposition 47, enacted in 2014, which reclassified certain thefts under $950 and drug possessions as misdemeanors, contributing to reduced arrests and clearance rates for larceny, alongside subsequent increases in property offenses relative to pre-2014 baselines and other U.S. states. Homelessness persists as a visible issue, with Alameda County's 2024 point-in-time count documenting a 45% drop in Berkeley's unsheltered population since 2021 due to targeted interventions, yet the city still contends with hundreds experiencing street homelessness amid high regulatory barriers to development that exacerbate supply shortages. These outcomes reflect causal trade-offs from policies prioritizing decriminalization and affordability mandates over enforcement and market incentives, as evidenced by stagnant housing production despite demand pressures.

Other U.S. places named Berkeley include Berkeley Heights, New Jersey, a suburban township in Union County originally incorporated in 1809 as New Providence Township and renamed in 1951, with a 2020 population of 13,285; it features low-density residential areas and corporate parks supporting a commuter economy. Berkeley Lake, Georgia, a small city in Gwinnett County incorporated in 1956, had a 2020 population of 2,054 and centers on a recreational lake with upscale residential development.

## People

### Philosophers and theologians

George Berkeley (1685–1753), an Anglo-Irish philosopher and bishop of Cloyne in the Church of Ireland, developed subjective idealism as a response to empiricist materialism, arguing from sensory experience that unperceived objects lack independent existence. Born on March 12, 1685, near Kilkenny, Ireland, he studied at Trinity College Dublin, where he was influenced by Lockean empiricism but rejected its foundational assumption of material substance underlying perceptions. Berkeley contended that ideas derived solely from sensation and reflection, with no empirical warrant for positing unobserved matter as their cause, thereby prioritizing direct perceptual evidence over abstract hypotheses of hidden realities.

In his seminal 1710 work, *A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge*, Berkeley articulated the core principle "*esse est percipi*"—to be is to be perceived—asserting that objects exist only as collections of sensible ideas in perceiving minds, without need for a mediating material substrate. This challenged John Locke's distinction between primary and secondary qualities, as Berkeley demonstrated through first-principles analysis that all qualities are mind-dependent: for instance, extension, figure, and motion are themselves perceived ideas, not properties of independent matter. He critiqued materialist causality as illusory, replacing it with a divine order where God perpetually perceives all ideas, ensuring continuity and order in nature absent finite human observers.

Berkeley's theology integrated this idealism, portraying God as the infinite perceiver whose constant awareness sustains the universe, thus resolving apparent solipsistic implications by grounding reality in eternal divine mind rather than individual perception alone. Critics, including Samuel Johnson in 1710 correspondence, accused the system of undermining common-sense realism by rendering unperceived objects nonexistent, yet Berkeley defended it as more empirically rigorous, avoiding the unverifiable posit of matter while aligning with observed coherence via providential causation. His later works, such as *Alciphron* (1732), further applied these principles to refute atheism by emphasizing immaterial souls and divine agency over mechanistic explanations.

### Politicians, nobility, and military figures

The Berkeley family, an ancient English aristocratic lineage originating in Gloucestershire, held the feudal barony of Berkeley from the late 12th century, with the title Baron Berkeley created by writ in 1295 for Thomas de Berkeley (c. 1245–1321). Thomas, summoned to Parliament as the first baron, served in Edward I's military campaigns, including the conquest of Wales in 1282–1283 and operations against Scotland, where he commanded forces at the siege of Carlaverock in 1300; his tenure emphasized feudal obligations tied to Berkeley Castle, which bolstered the family's regional influence through land management and knight service. Later generations participated in the Wars of the Roses (1455–1487), with divisions such as William Berkeley, 1st Marquess of Berkeley (d. 1508), aligning variably with Lancastrian and Yorkist factions, contributing to the dynasty's survival amid shifting allegiances that preserved their estates despite forfeitures and restorations.

Sir William Berkeley (1605–1677), a member of the cadet branch, governed the Colony of Virginia for 34 years across two terms (1641–1652 and 1660–1677), the longest tenure of any royal governor. Appointed by Charles I, he promoted economic expansion through the headright system, granting 50 acres per imported settler, which spurred tobacco exports from 1.5 million pounds in 1640 to over 20 million by 1670 and doubled the colonial population to approximately 40,000 by his death.  His policies favored established planters, limiting western expansion to avoid Native American conflicts, but this elite-centric approach fueled Bacon's Rebellion in 1676, where rebel forces under Nathaniel Bacon burned Jamestown over grievances of inadequate frontier protection and monopolized fur trade privileges, resulting in over 20 royalist deaths before Berkeley's forces suppressed the uprising with reprisals claiming up to 23 rebel lives. 

Sir John Berkeley (1607–1678), 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton, exemplified the family's military tradition as a Royalist commander in the English Civil War, leading Parliamentarian forces to defeat at the Battle of Stratton on May 16, 1643, where his 4,000 troops routed 6,000 Cornish rebels, capturing key artillery and securing western England for Charles I temporarily. Baptized in Bruton, Somerset, he rose through court service and diplomacy, later governing New Jersey as a proprietor from 1664, blending martial prowess with colonial administration amid Restoration politics.

### Entertainers and artists

Busby Berkeley (1895–1976), born William Enos Berkeley, was an influential American choreographer and film director renowned for revolutionizing musical sequences through innovative camera techniques, including overhead "top shots" that created kaleidoscopic geometric patterns of dancers. His work at Warner Bros. in the early 1930s, amid the Great Depression, provided escapist entertainment; for instance, *42nd Street* (1933), which he choreographed, earned over $2.3 million at the U.S. box office and received an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture, marking a financial boon for the studio despite production costs. Berkeley's methods, involving precise formations of hundreds of performers, influenced subsequent cinema but drew scrutiny for exhaustive rehearsals that sometimes led to performer injuries and overwork.

Berkeley Breathed (born 1957), an American cartoonist and author, gained prominence with his satirical comic strip *Bloom County* (1980–1989), which critiqued politics and culture through characters like Opus the penguin and Bill the Cat, amassing a readership of over 15 million in U.S. newspapers at its peak. The strip earned him the 1987 Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning, one of only two such awards for a daily multi-panel comic, recognizing its incisive commentary on issues like environmentalism and media sensationalism. Breathed later created spin-offs *Outland* (1989–1995) and revived *Bloom County* in online format in 2015, while authoring children's books that sold millions, such as the *Mars Needs Moms!* series, adapted into a 2011 film.

Xander Berkeley (born 1955), an American character actor, has appeared in over 150 film and television projects, often in antagonistic or authoritative roles, including Todd Voight, the treacherous corporate operative in *Terminator 2: Judgment Day* (1991), which grossed $520 million worldwide. Notable performances also include Dr. Victor Lamar in *Gattaca* (1997), exploring genetic determinism, and Secret Service Agent Gibbs in *Air Force One* (1997), a box-office success earning $315 million globally. His television work spans series like *24* (as George Mason, 2002–2003) and *The Walking Dead* (as Gregory, 2016–2018), contributing to ensemble casts in critically acclaimed productions.

## Institutions and education

### Universities and colleges

The University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley), founded in 1868 as the state's land-grant institution, operates as a public research university and the flagship campus of the University of California system. In fall 2024, it enrolled 33,070 undergraduates and 12,812 graduate students, totaling approximately 45,882. UC Berkeley has generated substantial research impact, with over 100 Nobel Prize affiliates among its faculty, alumni, and researchers across fields including physics, chemistry, and economics. During World War II, the campus played a pivotal role in the Manhattan Project through the Radiation Laboratory (now Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory), founded by Ernest Lawrence in 1931, which advanced uranium isotope separation techniques essential to atomic bomb development; J. Robert Oppenheimer, later project director, conducted early theoretical work there.

In recent years, UC Berkeley has emphasized technology transfer via initiatives like SkyDeck, its startup accelerator launched in partnership with the Haas School of Business, which has supported over 300 companies since 2016 and invests $200,000 in selected ventures to foster innovation in areas such as AI and biotech. However, administrative responses to campus protests in the 2020s, particularly following 2023-2024 demonstrations related to the Israel-Hamas conflict, have drawn criticism for imposing restrictions on speech and assembly, including event permit denials and encampment clearances that prioritized institutional order over historical free expression precedents like the 1964 Free Speech Movement. These actions, amid federal investigations into antisemitism handling, highlight tensions between empirical academic output and evolving governance priorities influenced by progressive institutional norms.

Berkeley College, a private for-profit institution established in 1931, maintains campuses in New York City, New Jersey, and offers online programs focused on career-oriented fields like business, health studies, and professional services. With approximately 1,731 undergraduates at its New York campus and 1,907 at its New Jersey location in fall 2024, it emphasizes practical training over research, lacking the Nobel-level scholarly output of UC Berkeley. 

### Schools and academies

Berkeley Preparatory School in Tampa, Florida, operates as an independent, coeducational day school for grades pre-kindergarten through 12, established in 1960 by Tampa Bay-area families desiring a non-boarding alternative with a focus on academic rigor. Initially affiliated with the Episcopal Church, it has sustained connections to the Diocese of Southwest Florida while delivering a curriculum geared toward college preparation, including advanced courses in sciences, humanities, and arts. Enrollment stands at approximately 1,600 students, with the institution earning a top ranking among private K-12 schools in the Tampa region based on metrics such as academic performance and parent feedback.

The Berkeley Carroll School in Brooklyn, New York, serves pre-kindergarten through grade 12 as a private, coeducational college-preparatory institution, with roots tracing to 1883 when Reverend Alfred C. Roe began informal classes for girls; it received its state charter as the Berkeley Institute in 1886. The school merged with the Carroll Street School—a boys' academy founded in 1856—in 1982, expanding to full coeducation and unifying under its current name. It enrolls around 1,000 students across multiple divisions, emphasizing inquiry-based learning in history, ethics, and global studies, supported by facilities including a historic Lincoln Place building constructed in 1898.

## Brands and enterprises

### Manufacturing and consumer goods

Berkeley Cars Ltd., based in Biggleswade, Bedfordshire, England, manufactured lightweight sports cars and microcars from October 1956 to December 1960. The vehicles featured innovative fiberglass monocoque bodies, front-wheel drive, and chain final drive, powered by air-cooled two-stroke motorcycle engines sourced from suppliers like Anzani and Excelsior, with displacements from 322 cc to 692 cc. Approximately 4,100 units were produced across various models before the company ceased operations due to engine supply shortages and financial strain.

The debut SA322 Sports model, introduced in September 1956, used a 322 cc Anzani twin-cylinder engine delivering 18 horsepower, achieving top speeds around 80 mph despite weighing under 700 pounds. Success led to the SE328 variant in 1957, with an Excelsior 328 cc engine, of which about 1,259 were built by April 1958. Later iterations like the SE492 (492 cc, 1958–1959, approximately 666 units) offered seating for four in a "Twosome" configuration, targeting budget-conscious buyers amid lingering post-war fuel rationing effects and rising petrol costs.

In 1959, Berkeley introduced the T60 three-wheeler, a microcar with a single rear wheel and 328 cc Excelsior engine, designed for urban efficiency and qualifying for lower British vehicle taxes on three-wheelers. Only a limited number were made before production halted, reflecting the era's experimentation with compact, economical transport amid economic recovery but limited by reliability issues common to two-stroke engines, such as frequent spark plug fouling. These cars exemplified niche British engineering ingenuity but failed to achieve broader market penetration due to competition from established marques and the shift toward more conventional four-wheeled designs.

### Software and technology

Berkeley DB is an embeddable key-value store database engine originally developed at the University of California, Berkeley, to unify in-memory and on-disk data access methods for Unix systems. Its first public release occurred in 1994, building on earlier research prototypes from the early 1990s that introduced features like B+tree access methods for efficient querying. Commercialized by Sleepycat Software, it gained traction for its ACID-compliant transactions and high performance in resource-constrained environments, powering applications from mobile devices to enterprise software. Oracle Corporation acquired Sleepycat—and thus Berkeley DB—in February 2006, after which deployments exceeded 200 million instances worldwide, underscoring its reliability in handling persistent storage without requiring a dedicated server process. Despite the acquisition, Oracle has maintained open-source licensing options, such as the Sleepycat License, fostering continued integration into projects emphasizing modularity and low overhead.

Berkeley sockets constitute the foundational API for interprocess communication over networks, introduced in the 4.2BSD Unix release from the University of California, Berkeley, in August 1983. This interface abstracted socket endpoints as file descriptors, enabling developers to implement protocols like TCP and UDP through standardized calls for binding, connecting, and data transfer, which supplanted earlier ad-hoc networking in Unix variants. Its adoption in BSD distributions accelerated the proliferation of TCP/IP stacks, as BSD's permissive licensing allowed free modification and redistribution, contrasting with AT\u0026T Unix's proprietary constraints and thereby supporting early internet experimentation and scalability. The API's influence extended to POSIX standards in the late 1980s, forming the de facto model for socket programming across operating systems and underpinning open-source networking libraries that avoided vendor lock-in.

## Transportation

### Ships and naval vessels

HMS *Berkeley* (L17) was a Type I Hunt-class escort destroyer of the Royal Navy, laid down on 8 June 1939 at Cammell Laird, launched on 29 January 1940, and commissioned on 6 June 1940, marking the first Royal Navy warship to bear the name. She conducted convoy escort operations in the Atlantic during World War II, including protection against U-boat threats, before being torpedoed and sunk on 19 August 1942 by the German submarine *U-73* at coordinates 49° 57'N, 20° 22'W, approximately 120 miles west of Ireland; 37 crew members were lost in the sinking.

USS *Berkeley* (DDG-15) was a Charles F. Adams-class guided-missile destroyer of the United States Navy, laid down on 1 June 1960, launched on 29 July 1961, and commissioned on 15 December 1962, named in honor of Major General Randolph C. Berkeley, a U.S. Marine Corps officer who served in the Spanish-American War and World War I. Decommissioned on 30 September 1992 after nearly 30 years of service, she deployed multiple times to the Western Pacific, including operations with the U.S. Seventh Fleet starting in March 1964, and provided naval gunfire support to forces in Vietnam from 1965 to 1968, earning the Meritorious Unit Commendation for distinguished performance in combat.

### Other vehicles

Berkeley Cars was a British automobile manufacturer that produced lightweight sports cars and microcars from October 1956 to December 1960 at the Berkeley Coachworks factory in Biggleswade, Bedfordshire. The company, founded by engineer Lawrie Bond in collaboration with factory owner Charles Panter, focused on economical vehicles with fiberglass monocoque bodies mounted on simple tubular chassis, powered by two-stroke motorcycle engines for low cost and agile performance. Initial models like the SA322, announced in September 1956, used a 322 cc Excelsior Talisman twin-cylinder engine and seated two adults, achieving fuel efficiency around 50 mpg while prioritizing open-top motoring.

Subsequent variants evolved for better roadholding, including the SE328 introduced in 1958 with a 328 cc engine delivering approximately 18 bhp, independent all-around suspension, and a top speed of 75-80 mph; over 1,000 SE328 units were produced before supply constraints from engine maker Excelsior ended output. Later models such as the SE492 and B105 adopted four-cylinder Excelsior engines up to 105 cc displacement for four seats and higher speeds exceeding 90 mph, though total production across all types remained under 3,000 due to the niche market and component shortages. These vehicles exemplified post-war British microcar innovation but faced commercial challenges, leading to the marque's discontinuation.

In rail transport, the "Sir Berkeley" was a 0-4-0 saddle tank steam locomotive built in 1890 by Manning Wardle \u0026 Company (works number 1210) for civil engineering contractors Logan \u0026 Hemingway. Weighing about 12 tons with a 7-inch diameter boiler, it operated on 2-foot gauge tracks for construction duties across UK sites, including railway and dock projects, before preservation; its compact design suited temporary industrial hauling of materials and spoil. No significant aviation vehicles bear the name Berkeley beyond model kits from the unrelated Berkeley Models company, which produced gas-powered balsa gliders in the 1930s-1950s without full-scale counterparts.

## Other uses

### Hotels and accommodations

The Berkeley is a luxury hotel in London's Knightsbridge district, overlooking Hyde Park, with its current building established in 1972 after relocating from its original Berkeley Street site where it operated as a hotel since 1897; its origins trace to an 18th-century coffee house. The property features 190 rooms and suites designed in a contemporary style by architects including David Collins and Pierre Yves Rochon, emphasizing British heritage with modern amenities such as a rooftop pool, spa, and the Michelin-starred restaurant Marcus Wareing at The Berkeley. It has hosted notable figures and events, maintaining a reputation for high-end service amid Knightsbridge's upscale retail environment.

Post-2020, the hotel benefited from London's luxury sector recovery, where average occupancy rates for the market reached 84% in the 12 months ending May 2025, up from pandemic lows around 27% in mid-2020, driven by international tourism rebound and new room supply exceeding 10,000 units since early 2020.

Other notable establishments include the Berkeley Hotel in Richmond, Virginia, a boutique property in a restored 19th-century neoclassical building offering 55 rooms with period details and proximity to the James River. In Asbury Park, New Jersey, the Berkeley Oceanfront Hotel, opened in 1925, features oceanfront views, event spaces, and a history of celebrity guests including during its wartime use as a hospital.

### Miscellaneous

Berkeley Earth is an independent 501(c)(3) non-profit organization founded in 2010 by physicists Richard Muller and Elizabeth Muller to deliver transparent, open-source environmental data and unbiased scientific analysis on global temperatures and related issues. It reanalyzed surface temperature records from more than 39,000 land stations worldwide, incorporating spatial interpolation for data gaps and explicitly testing for potential biases such as urban heat island effects and adjustments in prior datasets, ultimately confirming a global land temperature rise of about 1.6°C since 1880, consistent with other independent analyses. Funded solely by charitable donations—including initial support from sources skeptical of prevailing climate narratives, such as the Koch Charitable Foundation—the organization emphasizes methodological rigor to counter accusations of systemic bias in academic and governmental climate data, with its peer-reviewed results cited in IPCC assessments and its high-resolution gridded datasets made freely available for replication.

The term "Berkeley" also appears in scientific nomenclature through berkelium (Bk), a synthetic radioactive element with atomic number 97 in the actinide series, named after the city of Berkeley, California, where it was first synthesized on December 19, 1949, by Stanley G. Thompson, Glenn T. Seaborg, and colleagues at the University of California's Berkeley laboratory via alpha-particle bombardment of americium-241. Berkelium has no stable isotopes, with the longest-lived being berkelium-247 (half-life of 1,380 years), and its production requires particle accelerators or nuclear reactors; it exhibits oxidation states up to +4, unusually high for actinides, enabling studies of chemical behavior in heavy elements but limiting practical applications beyond research. The naming honors the site's role in transuranic element discovery, following conventions like terbium for its lanthanide analog.
