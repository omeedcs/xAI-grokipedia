## Historical Background

### Early Life and Career in Serbia
Nikola Jokić grew up in Sombor, a small city in northern Serbia, where he developed a love for basketball at a young age. Despite his early interest in the sport, Jokić was not initially seen as a top prospect due to his unassuming physique and lack of athleticism compared to peers. He began playing professionally for Mega Basket, a Serbian club known for developing young talent, from 2012 to 2015. During his time with Mega, Jokić showcased his unique playmaking ability and earned the Adriatic League MVP award in the 2014-15 season [EuroLeague Profile](https://www.euroleaguebasketball.net/euroleague/players/nikola-jokic/007373/).

His rookie season was promising, as he averaged 10.0 points and 7.0 rebounds per game, earning a spot on the NBA All-Rookie First Team [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jokicni01.html). Over the next few years, Jokić rapidly developed into a star, becoming the focal point of Denver's offense with his ability to facilitate plays from the center position.
