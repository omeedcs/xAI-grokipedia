## Historical Background

### Early Life and Education
Marc Benioff was born in San Francisco, California, into a family with entrepreneurial roots. His father owned a chain of women's clothing stores, which exposed Benioff to business operations from a young age. He developed an early interest in technology, writing his first software program at the age of 15 and founding a company, Liberty Software, to create games for the Atari 8-bit computer. By 16, he had earned enough from his software ventures to purchase his first car [Forbes Profile](https://www.forbes.com/profile/marc-benioff/).

Benioff attended the University of Southern California (USC), where he studied business administration and graduated with a Bachelor of Science in 1986. During his time at USC, he interned at Apple Inc., an experience that profoundly influenced his vision for user-friendly technology and innovation [USC Alumni](https://alumni.usc.edu/notable-alumni/marc-benioff/).

### Career at Oracle
After graduating, Benioff joined Oracle Corporation, a major database software company, at the age of 23. He quickly rose through the ranks, becoming the youngest vice president in the company’s history. During his 13-year tenure at Oracle, Benioff gained deep insights into enterprise software and cloud computing, which later inspired the creation of Salesforce. However, he grew frustrated with the traditional software delivery model, which required expensive on-site installations and maintenance [CNBC Interview](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/25/how-marc-benioff-built-salesforce-into-a-130-billion-company.html).

### Founding of Salesforce
In 1999, Benioff left Oracle to co-found Salesforce with Parker Harris, Dave Moellenhoff, and Frank Dominguez. The company was built on the revolutionary idea of delivering software over the internet, eliminating the need for physical installations—a model now known as Software as a Service (SaaS). Salesforce launched its first CRM product in 2000, targeting small and medium-sized businesses with affordable, scalable solutions. The company’s "No Software" logo became iconic, symbolizing a shift away from traditional enterprise software [Salesforce History](https://www.salesforce.com/company/our-story/).

Under Benioff’s leadership, Salesforce went public in 2004 on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: CRM), raising $110 million. The company has since grown into a global powerhouse, expanding its offerings to include marketing, analytics, and artificial intelligence tools through acquisitions like Tableau and Slack [Reuters Salesforce Growth](https://www.reuters.com/business/technology/salesforce-raises-full-year-revenue-forecast-2023-08-30/).
