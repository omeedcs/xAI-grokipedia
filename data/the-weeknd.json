  "content": "# The Weeknd\n\nAbel Makkonen Tesfaye (born February 16, 1990), known professionally as the Weeknd, is a Canadian singer, songwriter, and record producer of Ethiopian descent.\nHis music, blending alternative R\\u0026B, pop, and synthwave elements, often explores themes of drug use, romance, and self-destruction, drawing from personal experiences in Toronto's underground scene.\nTesfaye gained initial recognition in 2010 through anonymous mixtapes uploaded online, leading to the compilation album *Trilogy* (2012) and major-label debut *Kiss Land* (2013).\nSubsequent releases like *Beauty Behind the Madness* (2015), featuring hits \"Can't Feel My Face\" and \"The Hills,\" propelled him to mainstream stardom, with the former earning a Grammy for Best Urban Contemporary Album.\n*Starboy* (2016) and *After Hours* (2020) further solidified his commercial dominance, the latter including \"Blinding Lights,\" which became Spotify's most-streamed song ever and contributed to his Guinness World Record as the most popular artist.\nBy 2025, Tesfaye has sold over 24 million albums worldwide, secured four Grammy Awards, 20 Billboard Music Awards, and performed the Super Bowl LV halftime show.\nHe co-created and starred in the 2023 HBO series *The Idol*, which faced backlash for its explicit content and portrayal of exploitation, resulting in cancellation after one season amid claims of creative overreach.\n\n## Early Life\n\n### Childhood and Family Background\n\nAbel Makkonen Tesfaye, known professionally as the Weeknd, was born on February 16, 1990, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, to Ethiopian immigrant parents Makkonen Tesfaye and Samrawit Tesfaye.\\u003cgrok:render type=\"render_inline_citation\"\\u003e\n\\u003cargument name=\"citation_id\"\\u003e3\\u003c/argument\\u003e\n\\u003c/grok:render\\u003e He was their only child and grew up in the multicultural, low-income Scarborough neighborhood, a eastern suburb characterized by socioeconomic challenges typical of immigrant enclaves in urban Canada.\\u003cgrok:render type=\"render_inline_citation\"\\u003e\n\\u003cargument name=\"citation_id\"\\u003e11\\u003c/argument\\u003e\n\\u003c/grok:render\\u003e\\u003cgrok:render type=\"render_inline_citation\"\\u003e\n\\u003cargument name=\"citation_id\"\\u003e15\\u003c/argument\\u003e\n\\u003c/grok:render\\u003e\n\nTesfaye's parents separated when he was a toddler, leaving his father largely absent from his upbringing;

He subsequently left his mother's apartment in the Scarborough suburb of Toronto, relocating to a one-bedroom unit in the Parkdale neighborhood with Taylor. The pair subsisted on government benefits while immersing themselves in a lifestyle marked by heavy drug consumption, including ketamine, cocaine, MDMA, mushrooms, and cough syrup, which Tesfaye characterized as a \"crutch\" for coping and creative output.\n\nTo make ends meet amid financial strain, Tesfaye took entry-level work folding clothes at an American Apparel store. He supplemented this through petty hustles, such as stealing food from supermarkets, and more serious infractions like robbing strangers for shoes, leading to overnight jail stays around age 18. These survival tactics, coupled with frequent partying and casual pursuits in Toronto's nightlife, fostered the hedonistic and escapist patterns that would inform his later artistic themes, reflecting a deliberate rejection of conventional educational or career trajectories in favor of self-reliant improvisation.\n\nAround age 18, Tesfaye initiated his musical endeavors through self-taught bedroom recordings, initially composing tracks aimed at pop performers rather than personal release. Lacking formal training, he drew ambient influence from Toronto's urban R\\u0026B and hip-hop milieu but prioritized raw, drug-prolonged sessions to channel unvarnished personal realism over polished technique. This experimental phase underscored his independent streak, prioritizing introspective creation amid chaos over structured paths.\n\n## Career Trajectory\n\n### Mixtape Breakthrough and Trilogy (2009–2012)\n\nIn late 2010, Abel Tesfaye, performing under the pseudonym The Weeknd, began anonymously uploading songs to YouTube, including \"What You Need,\" \"Loft Music,\" and \"The Morning,\" which originated from sessions for his debut project and quickly attracted underground attention in Toronto's music scene for their atmospheric, hedonistic R\\u0026B sound. This direct-to-fan approach bypassed traditional industry gatekeepers, allowing organic sharing among listeners drawn to the raw, sample-heavy production and themes of excess.\n\nOn March 21, 2011, The Weeknd self-released the mixtape *House of Balloons* for free via his XO imprint's website, comprising nine tracks that expanded on the YouTube teasers with a cohesive narrative of party-fueled despair and addiction, produced primarily by Illangelo and Doc McKinney. The project gained viral traction online, amplified by endorsements from Toronto artists like Drake, who incorporated elements from its sessions into his 2011 album *Take Care*, highlighting shared regional influences without formal co-signing at the time. Follow-up mixtapes *Thursday* (August 18, 2011) and *Echoes of Silence* (December 21, 2011) continued the free digital distribution model, each delving deeper into nocturnal introspection and substance-laden lyrics, collectively forming an informal trilogy that solidified his cult following through word-of-mouth and peer-to-peer sharing.\n\nBy September 11, 2012, the momentum prompted a joint venture deal between XO and Republic Records under Universal Music Group, enabling wider physical and digital commercialization while retaining creative independence. This culminated in the compilation album *Trilogy* on November 13, 2012, remastering and bundling the three mixtapes with three new tracks, which debuted at number 4 on the Billboard 200 chart upon release. Critics praised the unpolished authenticity and innovative blend of 1980s pop samples with modern trap elements, though initial commercial promotion remained restrained, underscoring the efficacy of grassroots distribution in establishing viability before major-label involvement.\n\n### Kiss Land and Initial Mainstream Push (2013–2014)\n\nKiss Land, The Weeknd's debut studio album, was released on September 10, 2013, via XO and Republic Records. The project marked a transition from the anonymity of his earlier mixtapes to a more formalized release structure, incorporating synth-pop elements alongside confessional lyrics exploring isolation and fleeting encounters. It debuted at number 2 on the Billboard 200 chart, selling 86,000 copies in its first week and demonstrating commercial viability prior to broader pop crossover.\n\nThe album's themes were shaped by Tesfaye's initial international touring experiences post-Trilogy, with tracks evoking disorientation in foreign settings akin to a metaphorical \"Kiss Land.\" Promotional singles like \"Belong to the World,\" released on July 16, 2013, hinted at this pivot, achieving modest radio play and signaling a shift toward structured promotion while retaining atmospheric introspection. Other cuts such as \"Live For\" featuring Drake further bridged underground roots with emerging mainstream accessibility, though none achieved significant chart dominance.\n\nThe Kiss Land Fall Tour, commencing in late 2013, amplified the album's reach through live performances that solidified Tesfaye's reputation for immersive shows, including festival slots that drew expanding audiences. This period saw initial media focus on his depicted lifestyle of excess—drugs, transient relationships, and nocturnal excess—often framed by outlets as unfiltered authenticity mirroring his lyrics, despite the material's self-aware, performative undertones evident in its cinematic horror influences. Empirical indicators of independence included the tour's sold-out venues and album sales exceeding 300,000 units domestically by year-end, underscoring self-sustained momentum absent blockbuster hits. Such coverage, while boosting intrigue, overlooked the calculated artistry in portraying hedonism as both lure and trap, prioritizing narrative sensationalism over causal analysis of thematic construction.\n\n### Beauty Behind the Madness and Pop Ascendancy (2015–2016)\n\nBeauty Behind the Madness, The Weeknd's second studio album, was released on August 28, 2015, through XO and Republic Records. The project debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart, marking his first entry into the top position on that ranking. Its lead singles, \"Can't Feel My Face\" and \"The Hills,\" both reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100, with the former holding the peak for three nonconsecutive weeks and the latter for six weeks, making The Weeknd the first artist since The Beatles in 1964 to replace his own song at the top of the chart.\n\nThe album's production incorporated collaborations with pop producers like Max Martin, who co-produced \"Can't Feel My Face\" and contributed to refining its synth-pop and R\\u0026B elements for radio compatibility, contributing to its crossover appeal. This shift facilitated widespread airplay and streaming, with the record achieving over 1.5 million worldwide sales in 2015 alone and later certified multi-platinum in multiple markets, including 5× Platinum in the United States by the RIAA. At the 58th Grammy Awards in 2016, Beauty Behind the Madness earned the award for Best Urban Contemporary Album, alongside wins for \"Earned It\" in Best R\\u0026B Performance, underscoring industry validation of its commercial pivot.\n\nPromotional efforts, including performances at events tied to Drake's OVO Sound affiliation and partnerships with Apple Music—such as headlining the Apple Music Festival in London—amplified its reach through targeted streaming pushes. These initiatives aligned with data-driven metrics, as the album's tracks garnered hundreds of millions of streams in its initial months, evidencing a merit-based ascent driven by listener engagement rather than hype. While some early fans critiqued the polished sound as a departure from his raw mixtape origins, the quantifiable chart dominance and sustained sales refuted sellout narratives, establishing a self-reinforcing pop-R\\u0026B framework that propelled his independent empire.\n\n### Starboy and Commercial Peak (2016–2019)\n\nThe Weeknd released his third studio album, *Starboy*, on November 25, 2016, through XO and Republic Records. The project debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart, marking the third-largest debut week of 2016 with 348,000 equivalent album units. Featuring collaborations with Daft Punk on the title track and \"I Feel It Coming,\" the album showcased a shift toward synth-funk and electronic influences while maintaining the artist's signature dark R\\u0026B elements.\n\nThe lead single \"Starboy,\" featuring Daft Punk, achieved diamond certification from the RIAA in 2022, representing over 10 million units in the United States. Similarly, \"I Feel It Coming,\" also featuring Daft Punk, reached number four on the Billboard Hot 100 and earned 8× platinum certification by late 2024. These tracks drove the album's commercial success, with all 18 songs charting on the Billboard Hot 100 simultaneously. The supporting Starboy: Legend of the Fall Tour, spanning 2017, grossed $82.2 million from 77 shows and over one million tickets sold.\n\nIn March 2018, The Weeknd surprise-released the EP *My Dear Melancholy,*, which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, becoming his third consecutive chart-topping project. The six-track EP delved into introspective heartbreak themes amid personal turmoil following a high-profile breakup, blending atmospheric production with raw emotional lyrics. That same month, he collaborated with Kendrick Lamar on \"Pray for Me\" for the *Black Panther* soundtrack, released February 9, 2018, which underscored his versatility in cinematic contexts.\n\nDuring this period, XO Records expanded with signings including rapper Nav in 2016 and hip-hop duo 88Glam in 2017, bolstering the label's roster and contributing to The Weeknd's growing entrepreneurial footprint. These releases and ventures solidified his commercial dominance, with *Starboy* era revenues highlighting peak earnings from streaming, sales, and live performances.\n\n### After Hours and Pandemic-Era Stardom (2019–2021)\n\nThe Weeknd released his fourth studio album, *After Hours*, on March 20, 2020, through XO and Republic Records. The project served as a conceptual continuation of the narrative arc from his prior work *Starboy*, depicting a hedonistic character's descent into isolation, regret, and self-destruction following a failed relationship, underscored by themes of excess and emotional turmoil. Accompanied by interconnected music videos featuring viral visuals—such as the protagonist's bloodied, bandaged face symbolizing injury and detachment—the album revived 1980s synth-pop aesthetics with pulsating electronic production and retro-futuristic imagery. It debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, marking the largest opening week for an R\\u0026B album in the chart's history at the time, and topped charts in multiple countries including Australia, Austria, and Canada.\n\nThe lead single \"Heartless,\" released on November 27, 2019, introduced the album's sound with trap-infused beats and introspective lyrics, peaking at number three on the Billboard Hot 100. Follow-up \"Blinding Lights,\" issued in November 2019 ahead of the album, propelled its commercial dominance, achieving over five billion streams on Spotify by August 2025—the first song to reach that milestone—and establishing it as the platform's most-streamed track ever. Released amid the COVID-19 pandemic's onset, *After Hours* sustained momentum through heightened streaming amid lockdowns, with social media platforms like TikTok amplifying engagement; \"Blinding Lights\" alone featured in over 1.5 million user videos, fostering viral challenges and fan recreations that compensated for canceled live events. Virtual adaptations, including an immersive TikTok concert in July 2020 simulating the album's nightclub vibe, further bridged the gap left by restrictions, leveraging digital interactivity to maintain fan connection and drive plays.\n\nCulminating the era, The Weeknd headlined the Super Bowl LV halftime show on February 7, 2021, at Raymond James Stadium, self-funding approximately $7 million to retain creative control and extend the *After Hours* storyline with bandaged-faced doppelgangers and high-production choreography. The performance, drawing an estimated 96 million viewers, reinforced the album's visual motifs and synth-driven hits like \"Blinding Lights\" and \"Earned It,\" amplifying its cultural resonance despite ongoing pandemic disruptions. This adaptive strategy, rooted in digital and broadcast platforms, underscored how external isolation inadvertently boosted the album's escapist appeal and streaming metrics.\n\n### Dawn FM and Conceptual Experimentation (2021–2023)\n\nDawn FM, The Weeknd's fifth studio album, was released on January 7, 2022, through XO and Republic Records, adopting a conceptual framework styled as a late-night radio broadcast set in a liminal afterlife space. The project features narration by Jim Carrey, who voices a DJ character introducing segments and framing the narrative as a journey from excess toward redemption, with interludes evoking 1970s-1980s FM radio aesthetics. Guest appearances include Tyler, the Creator on \"Here We Go... Again,\" Lil Wayne on \"I Don't Want You to Leave,\" and Calvin Harris on production for several tracks, emphasizing collaborative experimentation over solo introspection.\n\nMusically, Dawn FM pivoted toward bright synth-pop and new wave influences, drawing from 1980s electronic dance and soft rock to contrast the darker tones of prior works, with tracks like \"Gasoline\" showcasing stuttering synths, breakbeats, and lower-register vocals akin to post-punk revival styles. This shift represented a deliberate aesthetic evolution, prioritizing euphoric, club-oriented arrangements—such as the Bernard Sumner-inspired delivery in select cuts—over the hedonistic R\\u0026B of earlier albums, while maintaining thematic continuity in exploring consequence and renewal. The album debuted at number 2 on the US Billboard 200, reflecting initial commercial viability amid its format innovation.\n\nListener engagement metrics underscored sustained appeal for this experimental direction, with Dawn FM accumulating over 5.66 billion streams on Spotify by late 2022, ranking among the platform's top albums that year despite varied critical responses emphasizing its hauntological nod to past pop eras over groundbreaking novelty. Tracks maintained high retention through algorithmic playlist integration, evidenced by consistent daily plays exceeding millions into 2023, prioritizing empirical playback data over consensus acclaim.\n\nThe After Hours Til Dawn Tour, launching on July 14, 2022, in Philadelphia, blended Dawn FM's radio motifs with hits from After Hours and earlier eras, staging a multimedia spectacle that provided narrative closure to themes of nocturnal indulgence by simulating a dawn transition via lighting and set design. This integration drove record-breaking financial performance for an R\\u0026B/hip-hop act in its initial phases, contributing to overall grosses surpassing $350 million from sold-out stadium shows by mid-2023, with over 2 million tickets sold in the first year alone, validating the conceptual risks through audience turnout metrics.\n\n### The Idol, Hurry Up Tomorrow, and Persona Closure (2023–2025)\n\nIn June 2023, Abel Tesfaye, known as the Weeknd, co-created the HBO series *The Idol* alongside Sam Levinson and Reza Fahim, starring as the cult leader Tedros in a plot involving a pop singer's entanglement with a self-help group revealed as a manipulative cult. The five-episode series premiered on HBO and Max on June 4, 2023, but drew widespread criticism for its graphic depictions of exploitation and uneven execution, leading to production turmoil including reshoots under Tesfaye's increased directorial input to align with his vision. HBO canceled the series after one season on August 28, 2023, citing completion of its intended story arc amid low viewership and backlash.\n\nTesfaye released *Hurry Up Tomorrow*, the concluding album in the trilogy initiated by *After Hours* (2020) and *Dawn FM* (2022), on January 31, 2025, via XO and Republic Records. The 22-track project features collaborations including Playboi Carti on \"Timeless,\" Anitta on \"São Paulo,\" Justice on \"Wake Me Up,\" and Future, Florence + the Machine, and Travis Scott on \"Reflections Laughing,\" blending synth-pop, R\\u0026B, and experimental elements to narrate themes of rebirth and finality. Preceded by singles \"Timeless\" and \"São Paulo,\" the album served as the multimedia capstone, integrating with a companion film and tour announcements.\n\nOn February 2, 2025, at the 67th Annual Grammy Awards, Tesfaye ended his boycott—begun in 2021 after *After Hours* was overlooked for Album of the Year— with a surprise performance of \"Cry for Me\" and \"Timeless\" featuring dancers in stylized choreography. This appearance aligned with promotions for *Hurry Up Tomorrow*, underscoring the project's role in resolving his public narrative arcs. Concurrently, he announced a new tour, the psychological thriller film *Hurry Up Tomorrow* (directed by Trey Edward Shults, starring Tesfaye alongside Jenna Ortega and Barry Keoghan, released May 16, 2025), and a broader reinvention termed \"new everything.\"\n\nIn January 2025 interviews, Tesfaye articulated the retirement of the \"Weeknd\" persona post-*Hurry Up Tomorrow*, attributing the decision to a mental breakdown that reframed his career trajectory and a reluctance to \"overstay at the party,\" while affirming continued music production under his birth name, Abel Tesfaye. This closure, echoed in album lyrics and visuals depicting existential unraveling and renewal, marked the endpoint of the character's drug-fueled, hedonistic saga originating from his early mixtapes, with the trilogy's releases providing empirical markers of thematic culmination through escalating conceptual cohesion and commercial data like chart dominance.\n\n## Artistry\n\n### Influences and Inspirations\n\nTesfaye has repeatedly identified **Michael Jackson** and **Prince** as foundational influences on his vocal delivery and musical innovation within R\\u0026B and pop frameworks, emulating their stylistic boldness and falsetto techniques from albums like *Thriller* (1982) and *Purple Rain* (1984). **R. Kelly** also ranks among his core inspirations, particularly for narrative-driven song structures reflective of urban experiences. These artists' emphasis on emotional intensity and genre-blending informed Tesfaye's early pursuit of a singer's career, with Jackson's work specifically credited for igniting his ambitions.\n\nHis vocal foundation traces to Ethiopian music cassettes played by his mother, which shaped his \"natural singing voice\" through undiluted cultural immersion in Amharic-language tracks and traditional scales, predating broader Western exposures. This heritage manifests in melodic phrasings and emotional timbre, as Tesfaye has described the \"feeling\" in his delivery as inherently African and potent beyond technical metrics. Ethiopian sounds' influence persists in live performances where he incorporates Amharic elements, linking his diasporic roots to output without dilution.\n\nThe Toronto milieu contributed via **Drake**'s moody, atmospheric production, which Tesfaye adapted into his initial synth-heavy R\\u0026B while crediting Drake's style as a reciprocal spark for the city's \"Toronto sound\"—characterized by hedonistic introspection and hazy beats. Early immersion in this OVO-adjacent ecosystem, including co-writing on Drake's *Take Care* (2011), reinforced a localized aesthetic of nocturnal excess, though Tesfaye initially shunned heavy contemporary listening to cultivate a distinct edge. Alternative acts like **The Smiths** provided lyrical melancholy, blending with 1980s pop echoes to form his synth-R\\u0026B hybrid, verified through self-citations and production lineages avoiding direct emulation.\n\nCulturally, horror films and **Martin Scorsese**'s cinematic grit shaped visual and thematic motifs, as seen in *After Hours* (2020) drawing from Scorsese's 1985 film of the same name for its nocturnal descent into urban paranoia and moral ambiguity. Drug culture's visceral realism, filtered through these lenses, informs aesthetic homages rather than mere replication, prioritizing causal narrative drivers over stylistic borrowing. This selective sourcing underscores a deliberate curation, evidenced by Tesfaye's interviews emphasizing heritage and forebears over transient trends.\n\n### Songwriting, Production, and Themes\n\nThe Weeknd's songwriting process originated in anonymous, confessional mixtapes during 2010–2011, where Abel Tesfaye drew directly from personal experiences of substance abuse and transient relationships, often collaborating closely with producers like Martin \"Doc\" McKinney and Carlo \"Illangelo\" Montagnese to craft raw, stream-of-consciousness narratives. By the mid-2010s, following his mainstream breakthrough, Tesfaye shifted toward more structured, collaborative writing sessions involving songwriters such as Jason \"DaHeala\" Quenneville, incorporating polished hooks and verse-chorus frameworks while retaining autobiographical elements, as evidenced by co-writing credits on tracks like \"Starboy\" (2016) with McKinney and others. This evolution reflected a move from lo-fi introspection to commercially viable storytelling, with Tesfaye maintaining oversight through co-production roles across albums, including executive production on *Dawn FM* (2022).\n\nProduction techniques emphasize atmospheric synth layers, extensive reverb on vocals to evoke isolation, and gradual tempo escalations building to euphoric drops, hallmarks traceable to early work with McKinney and Illangelo using MIDI guitars and analog synths for textured soundscapes. In later projects, such as the *After Hours* (2020) to *Hurry Up Tomorrow* (2025) trilogy, Tesfaye co-produced with electronic specialists like Oneohtrix Point Never, integrating cinematic synth-pop elements—pulsing basslines and retro-futuristic pads—to underscore narrative arcs of excess and consequence, demonstrating his hands-on control via credits on over half the tracks in these releases.\n\nRecurring themes center on the realism of hedonistic pursuits—addiction's hollow grip, ephemeral pleasures from drugs and sex, and moral ambiguities arising from self-destructive cycles—often dissected in tracks like those from *House of Balloons* (2011), where lyrics portray indulgence as a pathway to emotional void rather than fulfillment. These motifs evolve into redemption narratives by *Hurry Up Tomorrow*, grounding abstract excess in Tesfaye's lived sobriety journey post-2014, with songs framing hedonism not as glamour but as causal precursor to isolation and regret, prioritizing unflinching autobiographical candor over sanitized pop tropes.\n\n### Vocal Delivery and Musical Style\n\nThe Weeknd's vocal delivery centers on a light-lyric tenor range, with chest voice extending from low bass F to tenor G#, and head voice/falsetto reaching into the fifth octave for an approximate three-octave span overall. His falsetto production yields resonant, bright-toned highs with seamless chest-to-head transitions, precise pitch control in melismatic runs, and emotive vibrato at 5-6.5 Hz frequency, evoking a haunted, ethereal quality. \nThis technique fuses R\\u0026B falsetto traditions—marked by ornamental phrasing and dynamic emotional inflections—with pop hooks' melodic accessibility and trap's rhythmic sparsity in select tracks, defying strict genre bounds under the alternative R\\u0026B umbrella.  \nHis style evolved from the lo-fi, hazy vocal layering in 2011 mixtapes like *House of Balloons*—prioritizing atmospheric immersion—to arena-optimized clarity in albums such as *Starboy* (2016), where polished production amplifies vocal projection. Auto-Tune integration, via tools like Antares EFX on leads, functions as subtle enhancement to preserve natural dynamics rather than rigid correction, aligning with engineer Carlo Montagnese's view that the artist's emotion-driven phrasing demands minimal intervention: \"His singing is extremely dynamic, based on feeling and emotion.\"\nRegarded as an originator of dark alternative R\\u0026B, The Weeknd's 2011 trilogy causally shifted the genre from EDM-pop hybrids toward introspective, moody electronics and falsetto-heavy introspection, evidenced by subsequent R\\u0026B diversification and peer adoption of similar sonic palettes.\n\n## Business Ventures\n\n### XO Label and Entrepreneurship\n\nAbel Tesfaye, known professionally as The Weeknd, co-founded XO in 2011 alongside managers Wassim Slaiby and Amir Esmailian, and creative director La Mar Taylor, initially as an independent imprint for self-releasing his debut mixtapes *House of Balloons*, *Thursday*, and *Echoes of Silence*. This structure enabled direct distribution via platforms like YouTube and free downloads, bypassing traditional gatekeepers and fostering organic fan growth through viral sharing, which amassed millions of streams prior to any major-label involvement.\n\nIn September 2012, XO formalized a joint venture with Republic Records, a Universal Music Group subsidiary, transitioning to a distribution partnership that preserved Tesfaye's master ownership and creative autonomy while accessing broader marketing resources. Under this model, XO operates as a subsidiary imprint, signing and developing artists with emphasis on equity retention; for instance, rapper NAV, signed in 2016, secured hits like \"Myself\" (peaking at No. 64 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 2018) and leveraged XO's infrastructure for collaborations, including with Drake. This approach contrasts with conventional major-label advances that often cede long-term royalties, as XO prioritizes backend profit shares—reportedly allowing artists up to 50% ownership post-recoupment—evident in NAV's catalog generating sustained streaming income without full label recoupment burdens.\n\nXO's entrepreneurship extends to diversified revenue streams beyond recordings, including merchandise lines launched in 2017 that have yielded approximately $1 million in initial sales through limited-edition drops tied to album cycles. Festival integrations, such as branded activations at events like Coachella, further amplify earnings via on-site sales and sponsorships, though exact figures remain proprietary. By 2022, an expanded Universal partnership incorporated merchandising rights and future catalog administration, solidifying XO's role in Tesfaye's portfolio.\n\nThe label's acumen is underscored by its contribution to Tesfaye's catalog valuation, with XO-anchored masters driving streaming royalties—exemplified by over 86 billion total Spotify streams across his discography as of October 2025—and enabling financing pursuits valued at up to $1.3 billion in prior sales attempts and $1 billion in 2025 debt raises secured against music IP. This ownership-centric model empirically empowers creators against exploitation risks, as retained equity from hits like \"Blinding Lights\" (over 4 billion streams) translates to perpetual income, positioning XO as a blueprint for artist-led ventures in a streaming-dominated industry.\n\n### Fashion, Investments, and Brand Extensions\n\nTesfaye has cultivated a distinctive personal style characterized by monochromatic black ensembles, minimalism, and tailored menswear, which has influenced trends in contemporary fashion. His affinity for all-black outfits and custom pieces, such as those tied to album eras like *Starboy*, extends to capsule collections that reinforce his enigmatic image. In 2017, he launched an XO-branded artist capsule for his *Starboy: Legend of the Fall* tour, featuring apparel that aligned with his tour aesthetic and broadened his merchandise reach.\n\nTesfaye partnered with H\\u0026M on apparel lines to commercialize his style, starting with the Spring Icons menswear collection in early 2017, which offered affordable staples like jackets and shirts under $100 inspired by his wardrobe. This was followed by an 18-piece Fall 2017 collection incorporating XO motifs on hoodies, t-shirts, and bombers, available from September 28, emphasizing branded streetwear. However, after H\\u0026M's January 2018 ad controversy depicting a Black child in a hoodie labeled \"coolest monkey in the jungle,\" Tesfaye ended the collaboration, citing misalignment with his values. These ventures demonstrated a branding strategy linking fashion to his music narratives, though market performance data remains limited; the collections sold through H\\u0026M channels but faced criticism for overbranding in some reviews.\n\nBeyond apparel, Tesfaye has pursued investments in tech-adjacent and cannabis sectors to diversify revenue streams. In 2021, he invested in Flowhub, a point-of-sale platform for cannabis retailers, aligning with emerging legalization markets and his interest in wellness-adjacent industries. He followed with a stake in Koia, a protein shake brand, in March 2022, joining investors like Kevin Hart's Hart Beat Ventures to support functional beverage growth. Tracxn reports five total investments by mid-2025, spanning forex tech, digital remittance, and film studios, reflecting a calculated approach to high-growth areas rather than music core. These moves cultivate a mogul persona that bolsters album promotion by signaling financial independence and trend foresight.\n\nA key brand extension was Tesfaye's self-financing of the Super Bowl LV halftime show on February 7, 2021, investing $7 million personally to execute an *After Hours*-themed production with masked performers and narrative continuity from his prior visuals. This strategy prioritized artistic control over traditional sponsorships, yielding high ROI through amplified visibility; his manager estimated recoupment via post-show touring at $1.3 million per performance average, enhancing overall brand equity amid pandemic constraints. Such extensions tie directly to image cultivation, where self-funded spectacles sustain hype across album cycles, evidenced by 2017 earnings of $92 million partly from consistent branding and extensions. By 2025, pursuits like a potential $1 billion music rights-backed financing underscore scalable diversification, maintaining ownership while unlocking capital for further ventures.\n\n## Other Activities\n\n### Acting Pursuits\n\nTesfaye's first credited acting role was an uncredited cameo as himself in the 2019 crime thriller *Uncut Gems*, directed by Josh and Benny Safdie, where he appears in a nightclub scene confronting the protagonist Howard Ratner, played by Adam Sandler, reflecting his early \"punk\"-ier persona from around 2012. The film grossed $35 million worldwide against a $19 million budget, with Tesfaye's brief appearance serving primarily as a nod to his rising music fame rather than a substantive performance.\n\nIn 2023, Tesfaye took a lead role as Tedros, a sleazy nightclub owner and cult-like figure manipulating a pop star, in the HBO miniseries *The Idol*, which he co-created with Sam Levinson and Reza Fahim. Premiering on June 4, 2023, the series drew 913,000 total viewers across HBO linear and Max streaming on its debut night, marking a 17% decline from the premiere of Levinson's *Euphoria* in 2019. Viewership dropped further, with the second episode attracting 800,000 viewers in same-day metrics, indicating limited broader appeal despite ties to music promotion through integrated performances and soundtrack releases. Tesfaye described Tedros as intentionally \"a loser\" exploiting industry vulnerabilities, aligning the character with themes of hedonism from his music catalog, though empirical reception via audience scores and ratings underscored constraints from his novice status and persona overlap.\n\nTesfaye's acting output remains sparse, with roles often blurring into extensions of his musical identity, as evidenced by the self-referential lead in the 2025 film *Hurry Up Tomorrow*, directed by Trey Edward Shults, where he portrays a fictionalized version of himself stalked by a fan. This pattern suggests causal linkage to brand synergy over independent dramatic range, with no major box office or critical benchmarks yet to indicate expanded versatility beyond music-adjacent narratives.\n\n### Philanthropy and Social Contributions\n\nAbel Tesfaye, known as The Weeknd, was appointed a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) in October 2021, focusing on global hunger relief efforts. Through his XO Humanitarian Fund, he has contributed and pledged over $6.5 million to WFP initiatives, enabling the delivery of food assistance to millions facing severe hunger. This includes raising approximately $5 million from his North American Stadium Tour in 2022, where $1 per ticket sold and proceeds from exclusive merchandise were directed to the fund.\n\nIn April 2021, prior to his ambassadorship, Tesfaye donated $1 million to WFP's Ethiopia relief efforts amid conflict in the Tigray region, funding 2 million meals for affected populations; this aid targeted areas of acute food insecurity exacerbated by violence, with WFP reporting distribution to displaced families. His Ethiopian heritage, stemming from his parents' origins, informed this targeted support, though broader critiques of celebrity philanthropy note potential inefficiencies in selective regional aid; nevertheless, WFP metrics indicate the donation directly supported immediate caloric needs in a crisis where famine risks affected over 350,000 people at the time. Subsequent contributions included $2 million in April 2024 to provide 18 million loaves of bread to families in Gaza, addressing acute malnutrition in conflict zones.\n\nTesfaye's philanthropy extends to crisis response without overt political advocacy, emphasizing direct resource allocation. In June 2020, he donated $500,000 to the MusiCares COVID-19 Relief Fund to aid musicians facing income loss from pandemic shutdowns, and another $500,000 to the Scarborough Health Network in his Ontario hometown for frontline worker support and community health needs. These efforts, totaling over $1 million for COVID-19 relief, prioritized verifiable frontline impacts such as medical equipment procurement and financial aid to vulnerable artists, aligning with a pattern of quantifiable outcomes over symbolic gestures. Overall, his reported donations exceeded $8 million by 2022 across hunger and emergency aid, with WFP attributing specific meal equivalents to his funding as a measure of efficacy.\n\n## Personal Life\n\n### Relationships and Privacy\n\nThe Weeknd, born Abel Tesfaye, began a high-profile on-and-off relationship with model Bella Hadid in 2015, first spotted together at Coachella that April before confirming their romance publicly later that year. The couple split in November 2016 amid reports of differing lifestyles, reconciled briefly in 2018 after being seen kissing at Coachella, and ended permanently in 2019, with Tesfaye later reflecting on the emotional toll in his music without detailing private matters. \n\nIn early 2017, shortly after his initial split from Hadid, Tesfaye dated singer Selena Gomez for approximately 10 months, beginning in January and ending in October amid compatibility issues and her health concerns. Their romance drew intense media scrutiny, including paparazzi photos from trips to Italy and Miami, but Tesfaye has not publicly commented extensively on it beyond lyrical allusions in songs like \"Call Out My Name,\" which references unrequited emotional investment. \n\nSince 2019, Tesfaye has adopted an even stricter stance on privacy, rarely confirming romantic involvements and avoiding disclosures about potential partners, such as rumored links to DJ Simi Khadra starting in 2022. He has expressed aversion to marriage, describing it as \"scary\" in a 2017 interview and indicating a preference for having children prior to wedlock, though as of October 2025, he remains unmarried with no children.  This reticence extends to legal measures like non-disclosure agreements and limited social media engagement, critiquing media intrusions as violations that fuel unsubstantiated speculation rather than respecting personal boundaries. Patterns in his relationships correlate with recurring lyrical themes of transient heartbreak and emotional detachment, derived from firsthand experiences, though these do not imply endorsement of relational instability as normative.\n\n### Sobriety, Health, and Personal Growth\n\nIn January 2015, Abel Tesfaye was arrested in Las Vegas on suspicion of misdemeanor battery after punching a police officer in the head during a hotel scuffle involving a fight between his entourage and hotel security. He was released after posting $500 bail and later pleaded no contest to the charge in October 2015, receiving probation and avoiding jail time. The incident highlighted impulsive behavior amid his documented history of heavy substance use, which he later described as enabling erratic actions during peak addiction periods.\n\nTesfaye has acknowledged drugs as a creative crutch in his early years, contributing to extended, unstructured song lengths and periodic writer's block that persisted into later albums like *Starboy* (2016). By 2021, he reported quitting hard drugs entirely, adopting a \"sober lite\" approach limited to occasional marijuana and alcohol, which he credited with eliminating dependency for artistic output. This transition followed an \"off-and-on\" relationship with substances into 2020, after which he maintained abstinence from harder drugs.\n\nPost-2021 sobriety, Tesfaye demonstrated enhanced professional reliability, completing high-intensity tours such as the *After Hours Til Dawn* stadium run from 2022 to 2023—delayed from 2020 but executed without substance-related cancellations—grossing over $200 million across 70 dates despite a brief 2022 vocal loss at SoFi Stadium from which he recovered within weeks.  This contrasts with earlier career unreliability, including limited live performances tied to drug-induced vocal strain and creative inconsistency before 2016. The shift supported sustained output, with annual releases like *Dawn FM* (2022) and *Hurry Up Tomorrow* (2025), linking reduced substance reliance to prolonged career endurance under rigorous stage demands requiring precise choreography and endurance.\n\n## Controversies\n\n### Feuds with Peers\n\nThe Weeknd's most notable tensions with peers have centered on his early mentor and collaborator Drake, stemming from a mix of professional expectations and personal overlaps. In 2010, Drake first promoted The Weeknd's nascent mixtape tracks on his OVO blog, providing crucial exposure that helped launch the artist's career. By 2011, they collaborated on \"Crew Love\" from Drake's album *Take Care*, but The Weeknd declined to sign with Drake's OVO Sound label, opting instead for a major deal with Republic Records, which reportedly left Drake feeling unappreciated. Tensions escalated in November 2015 amid Drake's public feud with Meek Mill over ghostwriting allegations, when The Weeknd revealed in a *Rolling Stone* interview that he had written complete songs for Drake—tracks ultimately unused—which amplified perceptions of reliance on external contributions in Drake's process.\n\nDespite the strain, the pair reconciled professionally with Drake's feature on The Weeknd's \"Starboy\" single in September 2016, which debuted at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and propelled the album to over 18 million global sales without apparent commercial disruption from the discord. Subsequent friction arose in 2017 when The Weeknd briefly dated model Bella Hadid, followed by her short romance with Drake, prompting cryptic social media posts from The Weeknd interpreted as shading his Toronto counterpart. Lyrics on The Weeknd's 2019 track \"Lost in the Fire\" were seen by some as indirect jabs at Drake regarding ex-partners and trustworthiness, though neither artist escalated publicly.\n\nIn April 2024, amid Drake's broader conflicts with artists like Kendrick Lamar and Future, The Weeknd contributed to Future and Metro Boomin's album *We Still Don't Trust You*, with lines such as references to \"pillow talkin'\" and fake alliances viewed as subliminal shots at Drake's personal disclosures and alliances. Drake responded subtly in November 2024 during a livestream, requesting a host turn off The Weeknd's playing track with the comment, \"We don't listen to that.\" These exchanges reflect normative competitive undercurrents in hip-hop and R\\u0026B, where public spats rarely halt output—The Weeknd's *Dawn FM* (2022) and *After Hours* (2020) both exceeded 5 million units sold globally, while Drake maintained dominance—prioritizing career momentum over prolonged confrontation.\n\nPerceived friction with Usher in 2020 arose from The Weeknd's comments in a *Variety* interview accusing Usher's 2012 single \"Climax\" of mimicking his dark R\\u0026B aesthetic, particularly after producer Diplo credited Usher with innovating the sound. The Weeknd later clarified in an *Esquire* profile that no genuine feud existed, stating he had apologized to Usher, whom he cited as an influence, and emphasized admiration over animosity.\n\n### Plagiarism and Creative Ownership Disputes\n\nIn December 2015, The Weeknd (Abel Tesfaye) and the song's co-writers faced a copyright infringement lawsuit over \"The Hills,\" the lead single from his album *Beauty Behind the Madness*, alleging unauthorized sampling of a bassline from the score of the 2013 British sci-fi film *The Machine*, composed by Tom Raybould. The suit, filed by Cutting Edge Music on behalf of Raybould, claimed the track's low-end synth riff and atmospheric elements directly lifted from the film's soundtrack without clearance or credit, despite Tesfaye publicly praising the movie on Twitter prior to the song's release. Audio comparisons highlighted structural similarities in the bass progression and tension-building motifs, though defenders argued such elements are common in electronic and darkwave production genres influenced by 1980s synth aesthetics. The case settled out of court with an undisclosed agreement, resulting in no formal admission of plagiarism but leading to retroactive credits for Raybould in subsequent releases and performances.\n\nSimilar ownership claims arose in September 2021 when songwriters Suniel Fox and Henry Strange sued Tesfaye, along with co-producers, over \"Call Out My Name\" from the 2018 EP *My Dear Melancholy,*, asserting it copied melodic and chord structures from their 2017 instrumental track \"Vibeking.\" Plaintiffs pointed to side-by-side analyses showing overlapping piano riffs and emotional builds, positioning the dispute as an instance of uncredited derivation rather than homage. The Weeknd's team contested the allegations, emphasizing independent creation amid shared genre conventions in R\\u0026B balladry, but the parties reached a confidential settlement in March 2023, avoiding trial and public forensic audio breakdown.\n\nAdditional creative ownership friction emerged in 2019 when comic book creator Eymun Talasazan filed a trademark infringement suit against Tesfaye for using \"Starboy\" as an album title and persona, claiming prior rights to the term from his 2010 graphic novel series featuring a character of the same name. The complaint argued dilution of Talasazan's established brand in visual media, though Tesfaye's usage drew from Prince's symbol-era pseudonymity and 1980s new wave influences, not direct emulation. The case resolved via settlement, with no evidence of bad-faith copying presented in court filings, underscoring how thematic overlaps in pop culture often lead to preemptive legal resolutions rather than proven theft. These disputes highlight a pattern where Tesfaye's production, reliant on layered samples and nostalgic synth recreations, prompts claims but typically concludes in negotiated credits or payments, distinguishing referential artistry from verifiable infringement absent exhaustive waveform matching.\n\n### Lyrics Scrutiny and Cultural Backlash\n\nThe Weeknd's lyrics, particularly from his early mixtapes and collaborations, have faced accusations of promoting homophobia and misogyny, primarily from social media users and outlets critiquing specific lines for perceived insensitivity. In the 2019 track \"Lost in the Fire\" with Gesaffelstein, released on January 11, the line \"It was just a phase, you were tryna be a freak\" was interpreted by critics as dismissing same-sex attraction in women as temporary experimentation, sparking backlash on platforms like Twitter within days of release. This interpretation framed the narrative as biphobic, with commentators arguing it reinforced violence against bisexual women by invalidating their experiences. However, textual analysis reveals the lyrics as a first-person heterosexual fantasy, where the narrator expresses jealousy over an ex-partner's bisexual encounters to reclaim intimacy, rather than a blanket condemnation of homosexuality; the song's chorus emphasizes mutual desire (\"I wanna f**k you and your best friend\"), aligning with hedonistic themes absent broader anti-LGBTQ patterns across Tesfaye's discography, which consistently depicts heterosexual male perspectives on sex and addiction without recurrent homophobic motifs.\n\nAccusations of misogyny stem from objectifying language in tracks like \"The Hills\" (2015), where women are referred to derogatorily amid depictions of drug-fueled encounters, and \"Often\" (2014), which details casual sex with emphasis on physicality. Critics, including academic analyses, have labeled these as endorsing submissiveness or body-part reductionism, tying them to a toxic persona romanticizing abuse in Toronto's nightlife scene. Tesfaye countered in an August 2020 Esquire interview that such lyrics represent a fictional character drawn from his youth, not personal endorsement, evolved since his sobriety; he emphasized narrative distance, noting the same tracks portray women as complicit in excess (\"She asked me if I do this every day, I said often\"). Empirical fan reception supports this, with albums like *Beauty Behind the Madness* (2015) selling over 3 million copies globally and streaming billions without sustained boycotts, indicating audiences distinguish artistic excess from advocacy.\n\nThis scrutiny reflects broader cultural pressures to retroactively censor expression based on subjective offense, often amplified by ideologically aligned media, yet lacking causal evidence of harm; \"Lost in the Fire\" peaked at number 27 on the Billboard Hot 100 despite the uproar, underscoring artistic liberty's resilience against selective outrage that overlooks intent and context in favor of impact policing. Such backlash attempts, rooted in post-#MeToo sensitivity norms, have not demonstrably altered Tesfaye's output or popularity, as his catalog's hedonistic realism—mirroring raw human impulses—prioritizes unfiltered storytelling over sanitized conformity.\n\n### Grammy Snub and Industry Politics\n\nThe album *After Hours*, released on March 20, 2020, achieved unprecedented commercial dominance, topping the Billboard 200 for four non-consecutive weeks, generating over 444,000 album-equivalent units in its debut week, and spawning the single \"Blinding Lights,\" which became the longest-running number-one hit on the Hot 100 with 90 weeks and the most-streamed song of 2020 globally. Despite this empirical success, the album and its singles received zero nominations for the 63rd Grammy Awards, announced on November 24, 2020, marking a complete shutout amid widespread industry surprise.\n\nIn response, The Weeknd publicly accused the Recording Academy of corruption, tweeting on nomination day that \"the Grammys remain corrupt\" and demanding transparency from the process, which relies on secretive expert committees for genre categorization and final selections rather than pure voter merit. On March 11, 2021, he announced a boycott of future submissions, stating to *The New York Times*, \"Because of the secret committees, I will no longer allow my label to submit my music to the Grammys,\" citing longstanding opacity in the nomination system that the Academy itself had partially reformed in 2019 amid payola scandals and voting irregularities. Speculation centered on genre classification disputes, as new 2020 R\\u0026B voting rules empowered specialized committees, potentially leading pop/R\\u0026B hybrid works like *After Hours* to fall between categories without consensus, highlighting a structural undervaluation of R\\u0026B-leaning pop in Academy preferences that favor narrower genre silos over crossover commercial impact.\n\nThis exclusion underscored a disparity between verifiable market metrics and Grammy nods: while *After Hours* drove billions in streams and sales—far outpacing many nominated albums in raw consumption data—the Academy's process prioritized subjective committee judgments, often critiqued for reflecting voter demographics skewed toward legacy industry insiders rather than contemporary audience realities. The snub's causal roots appear tied to institutional gatekeeping, where merit-based dominance yields to opaque politics, as evidenced by the Academy's historical underrepresentation of urban/R\\u0026B genres despite their streaming supremacy, prompting broader artist skepticism toward the awards' legitimacy.\n\nPublic and fan backlash vindicated The Weeknd's commercial primacy, with \"Blinding Lights\" sustaining over 4 billion Spotify streams by 2021 and *After Hours* certifications exceeding 3 million units in the U.S., outcomes unmarred by Grammy validation and instead amplified by organic listener metrics that bypassed institutional filters. The boycott persisted until February 2, 2025, when he staged a surprise performance at the 67th Grammy Awards, delivering \"Cry for Me\" and \"Timeless\" featuring Playboi Carti, signaling a pragmatic return amid the Academy's ongoing reforms without formal submission or nomination involvement. This event underscored empirical artist leverage over awards politics, as his enduring streaming dominance—independent of Grammy endorsement—affirmed market-driven success as the ultimate arbiter.\n\n### The Idol Production and Reception Issues\n\nThe HBO series *The Idol*, co-created by Abel Tesfaye (The Weeknd), Sam Levinson, and Reza Fahim, encountered significant production challenges prior to its June 5, 2023 premiere. Initial filming under director Amy Seimetz concluded in February 2022, but Levinson subsequently overhauled the narrative, shifting focus from lead Lily-Rose Depp's character to Tesfaye's cult-leader figure, prompting extensive reshoots that inflated costs and delayed release by over a year. HBO acknowledged that early footage \"did not meet standards,\" leading to revisions amid reports of a disorganized set environment.\n\nUpon airing, the series faced immediate backlash for scenes perceived as exploitative and misogynistic, particularly a prolonged Episode 2 sequence involving Depp's character in a domineering sexual encounter with Tesfaye's, labeled by critics as \"torture porn\" and gratuitous. Outlets like *TIME* accused it of reveling in the exploitation it purported to critique, while mainstream reviews amplified claims of female objectification despite the show's satirical intent toward music industry predation. Tesfaye defended the content in a June 2023 *GQ* interview, stating the scenes were deliberately unsexy and designed to evoke discomfort, embarrassment, and unease rather than arousal, aligning with the character's manipulative dynamic. He reiterated this in subsequent comments, noting the negative reactions were \"very much expected\" given the purposeful aversion to eroticism.\n\nEmpirical viewership data underscored the series' underwhelming performance over its five episodes, with the premiere drawing 913,000 total viewers across HBO linear and Max streaming—17% below *Euphoria*'s 2019 launch—and subsequent episodes showing declines, such as Episode 2's dip.  Critical aggregation reflected this, yielding a 19% Rotten Tomatoes score, but audience metrics indicated broader disinterest rather than cancellation solely from amplified minority outrage in biased media circles. HBO axed the show on August 29, 2023, after one season, citing unsustainable costs against low retention amid the production's reported $54-75 million reshoots, though Tesfaye's music career sustained no measurable downturn from the fallout.  This outcome highlights how preemptive sensitivity to discomfort-driven critiques, often elevated by institutional outlets, can overshadow artistic provocation when unbolstered by audience engagement.\n\n## Legacy and Achievements\n\n### Commercial Milestones and Records\n\nThe Weeknd's single \"Blinding Lights\" achieved unprecedented streaming success, becoming the first song to surpass 5 billion streams on Spotify as of August 31, 2025. This milestone underscored its dominance, having previously topped Billboard's Greatest Hot 100 Songs chart and logged 90 weeks on the Hot 100, the longest run for any track in that chart's history. His overall catalog has amassed over 85 billion streams on Spotify as lead artist, with seven tracks exceeding 2 billion streams each—the most for any artist—and 29 songs surpassing 1 billion, reflecting sustained digital consumption.\n\nOn physical and equivalent sales metrics, The Weeknd has generated 116.3 million equivalent album units worldwide, led by *Starboy* with 23.4 million units, including 1.4 million in pure sales. His albums have also shown remarkable longevity on charts; *Starboy* reached 400 weeks on the Billboard 200 by July 2025, marking his first to achieve that endurance. He holds the distinction of entering over 100 songs on the Billboard Hot 100, with seven reaching number one, including \"Blinding Lights,\" \"Save Your Tears,\" and \"The Hills.\"\n\nLive performances have further quantified his commercial prowess, with the After Hours Til Dawn Tour grossing over $600 million and selling more than 4 million tickets worldwide since 2022, establishing it as one of the highest-earning tours by a Black artist. This revenue stream complemented his ascent from self-released mixtapes like *House of Balloons* in 2011, which gained viral traction on platforms like YouTube without initial major-label support, evolving into stadium-level draws through organic fan growth and hit-driven albums.\n\n### Awards, Recognition, and Critical Assessment\n\nThe Weeknd has received four Grammy Awards from 14 nominations, including Best Urban Contemporary Album for *Beauty Behind the Madness* in 2016 and Best R\\u0026B Performance for \"Earned It\" that same year. His absence from nominations for the commercially dominant *After Hours* album in 2021 prompted a public boycott of the Grammys, which he described as lacking transparency and fairness, underscoring perceived mismatches between artistic merit, sales performance, and award outcomes. He ended the boycott with a surprise performance at the 67th Annual Grammy Awards on February 2, 2025, featuring \"Timeless\" with Playboi Carti, following the submission of his album *Hurry Up Tomorrow* for consideration. This return highlighted ongoing tensions in the awards process, where subjective voter preferences can lag behind verifiable public reception metrics like streaming volumes and chart longevity.\n\nBeyond Grammys, he holds records for the most Juno Awards won by a male artist, with 22 honors, including Artist of the Year, Album of the Year for *Dawn FM*, and Single of the Year for \"Sacrifice\" at the 2023 ceremony. He has secured six American Music Awards, recognizing achievements in categories like Favorite Soul/R\\u0026B Male Artist. These accolades, while affirming peer and industry validation, often correlate more closely with domestic Canadian success for Junos and broad popularity for AMAs than with unfiltered artistic innovation, as evidenced by his early mixtape era receiving outsized praise relative to later pop-leaning works.\n\nCritical assessment of The Weeknd's oeuvre reveals a trajectory from underground acclaim to polarized mainstream evaluation, with early releases like the *House of Balloons* mixtape lauded for their raw, atmospheric R\\u0026B experimentation, contrasting later albums critiqued for formulaic pop shifts. *Dawn FM* earned an 8.0 from Pitchfork for its conceptual radio-station motif, yet *Hurry Up Tomorrow* drew a 7.8 alongside descriptors of it being \"opulent, elegant, and occasionally exasperating,\" reflecting fatigue with repetitive thematic indulgence. Reviewers like The Guardian noted its exhausting sincerity over 90 minutes, prioritizing sonic excess over lyrical depth. Such critiques, often from outlets with established tastes favoring niche genres, undervalue empirical indicators of influence—such as sustained fan engagement and billions in streams—which demonstrate broader causal impact beyond critic consensus, positioning awards as retrospective rather than predictive measures of cultural resonance.\n\n### Cultural Impact and Broader Influence\n\nThe Weeknd's early mixtapes, released in 2011, spearheaded the dark R\\u0026B subgenre by integrating moody atmospheres, explicit narratives of hedonism and despair, and unconventional samples from punk and alternative rock, diverging from the era's dominant EDM-infused pop-R\\u0026B sound. This approach disrupted traditional R\\u0026B conventions, which had leaned toward neo-soul introspection or upbeat commercialism, by prioritizing raw, nocturnal aesthetics that echoed 1980s influences like Michael Jackson while incorporating Ethiopian vocal inflections from his heritage. Adoption of this subgenre is evident in subsequent artists adopting similar atmospheric production and thematic candor, fostering a wave of alternative R\\u0026B that prioritized emotional vulnerability over polished escapism.\n\nHis visual storytelling in music videos, characterized by cinematic surrealism and gothic opulence, has shaped contemporary pop aesthetics, establishing a template for immersive, narrative-driven visuals that blend high fashion with dystopian motifs. This influence extends to fashion, where his preference for monochromatic, oversized silhouettes and emo-grunge elements has been emulated in streetwear trends, contributing to a broader cultural shift toward androgynous, nocturnal styling in urban youth culture. By normalizing explicit explorations of addiction, fleeting intimacy, and psychological fragmentation in mainstream lyrics, The Weeknd challenged prudish undercurrents in R\\u0026B, prompting a reevaluation of genre boundaries and enabling more unfiltered depictions of urban vice that resonated amid rising mental health discourse.\n\nAs an Ethiopian-Canadian artist, The Weeknd's incorporation of heritage elements—such as Amharic linguistic traces and cultural motifs referencing the Red Terror era his parents fled—introduced realistic diversity into global pop, countering homogenized representations by grounding abstract themes in immigrant resilience and non-Western sonic palettes. His initial free online release of mixtapes via platforms like YouTube and blogs democratized music access, bypassing label gatekeeping and elite curation; this model empirically empowered independent artists by demonstrating viral organic growth—garnering millions of streams pre-label deal—and inspired a causal chain of direct-to-consumer strategies that eroded traditional industry hierarchies. Long-term, this has projected a more merit-based ecosystem, where empirical listener data over executive fiat determines viability, though mainstream adoption has since hybridized with corporate co-optation.\n\n## Tours and Performances\n\n### Major World Tours\n\nThe Weeknd's Starboy: Legend of the Fall Tour, supporting his 2016 album *Starboy*, ran from November 2016 to November 2017 and grossed $82.2 million across numerous dates in North America and Europe, marking a shift toward larger arena and stadium venues. This tour featured enhanced production elements, including upgraded stadium setups that elevated the visual and auditory experience beyond previous efforts.\n\nHis subsequent After Hours til Dawn Tour, launched in January 2022 after delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic, became his most ambitious outing, spanning stadiums worldwide and grossing $635.5 million with 5.1 million tickets sold as of August 2025. The tour's European leg alone generated $158.1 million from 30 shows attended by over 1.6 million fans, setting records such as the highest single-night attendance at London's Wembley Stadium with 80,000 tickets sold. Pandemic adaptations included virtual experiences like the immersive TikTok concert \"The Weeknd Experience\" in August 2020, bridging the gap until live touring resumed.\n\n| Tour Name                  | Duration          | Gross Revenue     | Tickets Sold |\n|----------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|--------------|\n| Starboy: Legend of the Fall| 2016–2017        | $82.2 million    | Not specified |\n| After Hours til Dawn      | 2022–ongoing     | $635.5 million   | 5.1 million |\n\nThese tours demonstrated evolving production with narrative staging that integrated thematic elements from *After Hours* and *Dawn FM*, such as cinematic visuals and character-driven performances, contributing to their commercial dominance. Overall, The Weeknd's concert career has amassed $734 million in grosses from over 200 shows since 2012.\n\n### Iconic Live Events and Stadium Shows\n\nThe Weeknd's Super Bowl LV halftime show on February 7, 2021, marked a pivotal solo spectacle, featuring a 13-minute medley of hits such as \"Starboy,\" \"The Hills,\" \"Can't Feel My Face,\" and \"Blinding Lights,\" staged amid a narrative of masked performers and his own bandaged visage to evoke the *After Hours* album's aesthetic. He personally contributed $7 million to production expenses, supplementing the NFL's budget, to realize the elaborate vision without corporate sponsorship constraints. The broadcast attracted approximately 96.6 million U.S. viewers, underscoring his capacity to command massive audiences in a format typically shared among multiple acts.\n\nIn April 2022, The Weeknd co-headlined the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival's closing night, stepping in after Kanye West's withdrawal, and delivered a set blending his catalog with Swedish House Mafia collaborations, including renditions of \"Heartless,\" \"Save Your Tears,\" and \"Moth to a Flame.\" This performance, reportedly the highest-paid in Coachella history up to that point, highlighted his draw as a festival closer, drawing tens of thousands to the Empire Polo Club amid a resurgence of live events post-pandemic.\n\nThe Weeknd made a surprise return to the Grammy Awards stage on February 2, 2025, performing \"Cry for Me\" and \"Timeless\" featuring Playboi Carti, flanked by dancers under strobe lighting, ending a prior boycott over nomination disputes. This appearance, broadcast to millions, reaffirmed his live prowess in high-stakes televised formats despite industry tensions.\n\nA planned one-night stadium show at the Rose Bowl on January 25, 2025, tied to the *Hurry Up Tomorrow* album release, was cancelled due to Los Angeles wildfires, depriving fans of what was billed as an in-the-round spectacle but preventing it from manifesting as a landmark event. These standalone outings, distinct from extended tours, empirically demonstrate his appeal through peak viewership and attendance metrics, such as the Super Bowl's audience scale exceeding many comparable broadcasts.\n\n## Discography\n\n### Studio Albums\n\nThe Weeknd's studio albums, beginning with his debut proper following the 2012 *Trilogy* compilation of earlier mixtapes, have consistently achieved high commercial performance on the Billboard 200 chart.\n\nHis first studio album, *Kiss Land*, released on September 10, 2013, debuted and peaked at number two on the Billboard 200 with 95,000 album-equivalent units in its first week.
