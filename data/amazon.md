## Introduction

Amazon, officially known as Amazon.com, Inc., is an American multinational technology company headquartered in Seattle, Washington. Founded in 1994 by Jeff Bezos, Amazon started as an online bookstore but has since evolved into one of the world's largest e-commerce platforms, cloud computing providers, and digital streaming services. Often referred to as a "tech giant," Amazon operates in various sectors, including retail, entertainment, and artificial intelligence, and is a key player in the global economy. With a mission to be "Earth's most customer-centric company," Amazon has reshaped consumer behavior and business models worldwide [Amazon History](https://www.aboutamazon.com/about-us/our-history).

## Historical Background

Amazon was founded on July 5, 1994, by Jeff Bezos in Bellevue, Washington, initially as an online bookstore. Bezos chose the name "Amazon" to evoke the image of something vast and powerful, inspired by the Amazon River, the largest river in the world by volume. The company went public in 1997, raising $54 million through its initial public offering (IPO) despite not turning a profit at the time [History of Amazon IPO](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/15/amazons-ipo-20-years-ago.html).

In its early years, Amazon expanded beyond books to include music, videos, and other products, adopting an aggressive growth strategy. By the late 1990s and early 2000s, it introduced innovative features like customer reviews and personalized recommendations. The launch of Amazon Prime in 2005, a subscription service offering free two-day shipping, marked a significant milestone in customer loyalty programs [Amazon Prime History](https://www.forbes.com/sites/blakemorgan/2019/07/17/how-amazon-prime-changed-the-shipping-industry/).

Amazon also pioneered cloud computing with the introduction of Amazon Web Services (AWS) in 2006, which has become a major revenue driver and a backbone for countless internet services worldwide [AWS History](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/). Over the decades, Amazon has acquired numerous companies, including Whole Foods Market in 2017 for $13.7 billion, expanding its footprint into physical retail [Whole Foods Acquisition](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-whole-foods-m-a-amazon-com-idUSKBN1971RV).

Beyond e-commerce and cloud computing, Amazon has made significant strides in entertainment through Amazon Prime Video, which competes with Netflix and Disney+. The company also produces consumer electronics like the Kindle e-reader, Echo smart speakers, and Fire tablets. Additionally, Amazon is investing heavily in artificial intelligence, logistics innovation, and sustainability initiatives, such as its pledge to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2040 [Amazon Sustainability](https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/).

However, Amazon faces criticism over labor practices, tax policies, and its impact on small businesses. Allegations of poor working conditions in warehouses and anti-competitive behavior have led to scrutiny from regulators and activists worldwide [Amazon Labor Criticism](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/dec/02/amazon-workers-face-increased-risk-of-injury-during-holiday-rush-report).
