  "content": "# Tom Hanks\n\nThomas Jeffrey Hanks (born July 9, 1956) is an American actor, filmmaker, and producer known for his versatile portrayals across comedy and drama, establishing him as one of the most influential figures in contemporary cinema.\n\nHanks rose to prominence in the 1980s with lead roles in films like *Splash* (1984) and *Big* (1988), which showcased his comedic timing and everyman appeal, before transitioning to more serious dramatic work that earned him widespread critical recognition. He won consecutive Academy Awards for Best Actor for his performance as a lawyer with AIDS in *Philadelphia* (1993) and as the titular character in *Forrest Gump* (1994), roles that highlighted his ability to embody complex emotional depth and historical resonance.\n\nThroughout his career, Hanks has starred in landmark films including *Saving Private Ryan* (1998), *Cast Away* (2000), and the *Toy Story* franchise, contributing to domestic box office earnings exceeding $5 billion and worldwide totals surpassing $10 billion, ranking him among the highest-grossing actors of all time. In 2016, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama in recognition of his meritorious contributions to national security, national interests, world peace, and cultural enrichment through his artistic endeavors. Hanks has also extended his influence into television production, notably as executive producer of the Emmy-winning miniseries *Band of Brothers* (2001), further demonstrating his commitment to storytelling grounded in historical events.\n\n## Early life and education\n\n### Family background and childhood\n\nThomas Jeffrey Hanks was born on July 9, 1956, in Concord, California, to Amos Mefford Hanks, an itinerant cook, and Janet Marylyn Frager, a hospital worker. His parents divorced in 1961 when Hanks was five years old, after which he primarily lived with his father, who remarried multiple times and worked various transient jobs that necessitated frequent moves across Northern California. This instability resulted in Hanks residing in ten different homes by the age of ten, often as the \"new kid\" in unfamiliar communities, which he later described as fostering a sense of isolation and perpetual outsider status.\n\nThe pattern of relocations stemmed from his father's successive marriages and short-term employment, including stints as a cook in remote areas, leading to shifts between cities like Oakland and rural spots; Hanks has recounted how these disruptions instilled early self-reliance amid emotional disconnection from consistent family structures. Genealogical research traces Hanks' paternal lineage to John Hanks (1680–1740), making him a third cousin four times removed to President Abraham Lincoln through shared ancestry via Lincoln's mother, Nancy Hanks.\n\nAs a child during the 1960s space race, Hanks developed a keen interest in space exploration, building plastic model rockets and avidly following live broadcasts of NASA missions from Apollo 7 onward, which he credited with sparking a lifelong fascination. He aspired to become an astronaut, simulating zero-gravity scenarios in his family's swimming pool, though the family's nomadic lifestyle limited sustained pursuits until later stability.\n\n### Formal education and early influences\n\nHanks graduated from Skyline High School in Oakland, California, in 1974, where he participated in school plays that first kindled his interest in performance.\n\nFollowing high school, he enrolled at Chabot College, a community college in Hayward, California, initially to fulfill general education requirements but soon shifted to theater studies after attending a production of Eugene O'Neill's *The Iceman Cometh* staged by the college's drama department. The performance, featuring Joe Spano in the lead role of Theodore Hickman, impressed Hanks deeply; he later recounted listening repeatedly to recordings of Jason Robards portraying the character, which crystallized his aspiration to act professionally. These experiences at Chabot provided foundational skills in theater amid his limited prior exposure, though he balanced studies with part-time jobs to manage finances.\n\nAfter two years at Chabot, Hanks transferred in 1976 to California State University, Sacramento, as a theater major. He departed the program after roughly one year, however, to pursue an internship at the Great Lakes Shakespeare Festival in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1977—his initial foray into paid professional work, earning $45 weekly while handling tasks from set assistance to minor roles. This move, driven by opportunity rather than formal completion, exposed him to rigorous ensemble discipline under artistic director Vincent Dowling, fostering practical resilience in an unstable early career phase without a degree.\n\n## Career\n\n### 1980–1989: Television debut and initial films\n\nHanks began his television career with the ABC sitcom *Bosom Buddies*, which aired from November 27, 1980, to March 27, 1982, over two seasons comprising 37 episodes. In the series, he portrayed Kip Wilson, an advertising executive who, along with his friend Henry Desoto (played by Peter Scolari), disguises himself as a woman named Buffy to reside in a women-only apartment building, providing opportunities to develop his comedic timing through physical humor and ensemble dynamics. Despite earning a 6.8/10 rating on IMDb and 80% on Rotten Tomatoes, the show achieved modest viewership and served primarily as a launching pad for Hanks' visibility in Hollywood.\n\nHanks made his feature film debut in the slasher *He Knows You're Alone* (1980), playing Elliot, a psychology student entangled in a bride-stalking killer's pursuits on Staten Island. The low-budget production marked his initial foray into cinema amid the era's horror boom but garnered limited commercial success.\n\nIn 1984, Hanks starred in two comedies that elevated his profile: *Splash*, a romantic fantasy directed by Ron Howard where he played Allen Bauer, a man falling for a mermaid (Daryl Hannah), which grossed $69.8 million domestically on an $8 million budget, ranking among the year's top performers. He followed with *Bachelor Party*, portraying Rick Gassko, a groom overwhelmed by a chaotic pre-wedding revelry involving excess and mishaps, further showcasing his aptitude for relatable, hapless protagonists.\n\nBy 1986, Hanks took leading roles in *The Money Pit*, as Walter Fielding, a lawyer navigating home renovation disasters with his partner (Shelley Long), blending slapstick with domestic frustration. That year, he also appeared in *Nothing in Common*, directed by Garry Marshall, as David Basner, a high-flying ad executive reconciling with his divorcing parents, including Jackie Gleason in his final role, introducing subtle dramatic elements to his comedic foundation.\n\nHanks' portrayal of Josh Baskin in *Big* (1988), a boy transformed into an adult navigating corporate life and wonder, solidified his \"everyman\" appeal through authentic innocence and charm, earning the film $115.2 million domestically and $151.9 million worldwide against an $18 million budget, alongside a BAFTA Award for Best Original Screenplay. These roles in light-hearted, accessible narratives built his reputation for embodying ordinary men thrust into extraordinary predicaments, prioritizing empirical appeal over critical acclaim at the time.\n\n### 1990–1999: Transition to drama and Academy Awards\n\nIn the early 1990s, Tom Hanks sought to escape typecasting in light comedies by pursuing more serious dramatic roles, marking a deliberate career pivot toward character-driven performances. This shift culminated in critical recognition, including two consecutive Academy Awards for Best Actor. His collaboration with directors like Jonathan Demme and Robert Zemeckis facilitated this transition, emphasizing emotional depth over physical humor.\n\nHanks appeared in the ensemble comedy-drama *A League of Their Own* (1992), portraying Jimmy Dugan, a washed-up baseball player coaching a women's team during World War II, which earned $107 million at the North American box office. The film blended humor with themes of gender roles and perseverance, serving as a bridge from his comedic past. Later that year, he starred opposite Meg Ryan in the romantic comedy *Sleepless in Seattle* (1993), playing a widowed father whose story captivates a journalist, contributing to its romantic appeal amid his evolving dramatic focus.\n\nThe pivotal role came in *Philadelphia* (1993), where Hanks portrayed Andrew Beckett, a gay lawyer fired after his AIDS diagnosis is discovered, earning him the Academy Award for Best Actor at the 66th ceremony on March 21, 1994, for a performance noted for its physical transformation and emotional vulnerability. The film grossed $207 million worldwide, addressing AIDS stigma through a legal drama co-starring Denzel Washington.\n\nBuilding on this acclaim, Hanks played the title character in *Forrest Gump* (1994), a slow-witted Alabama man whose life intersects key events in 20th-century American history, securing his second consecutive Best Actor Oscar at the 67th Academy Awards on March 27, 1995. The film grossed $678.2 million globally, becoming a cultural phenomenon with iconic lines like \"Life is like a box of chocolates\" and influencing quotable dialogue in popular media.\n\nIn *Apollo 13* (1995), Hanks depicted astronaut Jim Lovell in Ron Howard's recreation of the 1970 NASA mission's near-disaster, with the production involving close cooperation from NASA personnel and Apollo-era consultants for technical accuracy, emphasizing themes of ingenuity and heroism. The film achieved $355.2 million in worldwide earnings and received nine Oscar nominations.\n\nHanks starred as Captain John Miller in Steven Spielberg's *Saving Private Ryan* (1998), leading a squad to rescue a paratrooper behind enemy lines in World War II, praised for its visceral opening sequence depicting the D-Day invasion with unprecedented realism informed by veteran accounts and practical effects. The film grossed $481 million worldwide, earning Hanks his fourth Best Actor nomination and revitalizing interest in WWII narratives.\n\n### 2000–2009: Commercial successes and production expansion\n\nHanks portrayed Chuck Noland, a FedEx executive stranded on a deserted island after a plane crash, in the survival drama *Cast Away* (2000), directed by Robert Zemeckis. The film earned $429 million worldwide against an $85 million budget.) For this role, Hanks won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Motion Picture – Drama. He followed with *Road to Perdition* (2002), directed by Sam Mendes, playing a mob enforcer protecting his son amid gangster violence, which grossed $104 million globally. In *Catch Me If You Can* (2002), directed by Steven Spielberg, Hanks depicted FBI agent Carl Hanratty pursuing con artist Frank Abagnale, contributing to the film's $352 million worldwide gross.\n\nThe decade saw Hanks voice Woody in the *Toy Story* franchise, including the 1999 sequel *Toy Story 2* that extended into ongoing cultural impact through merchandise and re-releases, bolstering his voice acting appeal. In *The Terminal* (2004), directed by Spielberg, he starred as Viktor Navorski, a man trapped in a New York airport due to bureaucratic passport issues, grossing $219 million worldwide and highlighting immigration procedural themes. Hanks provided motion-capture performance for multiple characters in the animated *The Polar Express* (2004), directed by Robert Zemeckis, which amassed $318 million globally despite mixed critical reception for its pioneering technology.) *The Da Vinci Code* (2006), directed by Ron Howard, cast Hanks as symbologist Robert Langdon unraveling religious mysteries, grossing $760 million worldwide amid protests from Christian organizations decrying the adaptation's portrayal of historical and theological claims as blasphemous.)  *Charlie Wilson's War* (2007), directed by Mike Nichols, featured Hanks as Congressman Charlie Wilson covertly funding Afghan resistance against Soviet forces, earning $119 million.\n\nHanks expanded into production through Playtone, co-founded with Gary Goetzman in 1998, which backed independent projects achieving commercial breakthroughs. Playtone produced *My Big Fat Greek Wedding* (2002), a romantic comedy that grossed $368 million on a $5 million budget, marking one of the decade's top indie successes by leveraging cultural specificity for broad appeal.  This venture built on Hanks' earlier directorial effort *That Thing You Do!* (1996), fostering a pattern of nurturing ensemble-driven stories and collaborations with directors like Zemeckis and Spielberg, sustaining his box-office draw averaging over $200 million per major release in the period.\n\n### 2010–2019: Character roles and stage debut\n\nIn the 2010s, Tom Hanks shifted toward more nuanced character roles, frequently portraying historical or real-life figures in ensemble-driven narratives, diverging from his earlier dominance in blockbuster leads. This period emphasized biographical dramas and thrillers where Hanks embodied professionals facing high-stakes dilemmas, complemented by his return to live theater.\n\nHanks directed and starred in the 2011 romantic comedy *Larry Crowne*, playing a downsized retail worker who returns to college and sparks a romance with his speech professor, portrayed by Julia Roberts. Released on July 1, 2011, the film marked Hanks' feature directorial debut and focused on midlife reinvention amid economic uncertainty.\n\nIn 2013, Hanks led *Captain Phillips*, directed by Paul Greengrass, as merchant mariner Richard Phillips, whose ship was hijacked by Somali pirates in 2009. The thriller dramatized the real-life incident, earning critical acclaim for its tension and Hanks' portrayal of resilience under duress, though he received no Academy Award acting nomination despite the film's six Oscar nods, including Best Picture. The movie grossed $218.8 million worldwide on a $40 million budget.\n\nHanks portrayed attorney James B. Donovan in Steven Spielberg's 2015 Cold War drama *Bridge of Spies*, negotiating a prisoner exchange between the U.S. and Soviet Union in 1962. As the lead in this fact-based story of espionage and diplomacy, Hanks depicted Donovan's principled defense of a Soviet spy amid public backlash. The film received six Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, but none for Hanks' performance.\n\nThe year 2016 saw Hanks as Captain Chesley \"Sully\" Sullenberger in Clint Eastwood's *Sully*, recounting the 2009 \"Miracle on the Hudson\" emergency landing of US Airways Flight 1549. Hanks captured the pilot's calm expertise and subsequent NTSB scrutiny, contributing to the film's $243.9 million global box office on a $60 million budget.\n\nIn Steven Spielberg's 2017 film *The Post*, Hanks played Ben Bradlee, the executive editor of *The Washington Post*, supporting Meryl Streep's Katharine Graham in the decision to publish the Pentagon Papers exposing government deceptions about the Vietnam War. The role highlighted Bradlee's journalistic tenacity in a narrative of press freedom.\n\nHanks reprised his voice role as Woody in Pixar's *Toy Story 4* (2019), where the cowboy doll grapples with purpose after being donated to a new child, aiding Bonnie's toys in an adventure. This installment concluded Woody's arc with themes of loyalty and independence, grossing over $1 billion worldwide.\n\nThat same year, Hanks made his Broadway debut in Nora Ephron's *Lucky Guy*, starring as tabloid columnist Mike McAlary from April 1 to July 3, 2013, at the Broadhurst Theatre. The play chronicled McAlary's career highs and lows, culminating in his Pulitzer-winning coverage of police brutality. Hanks earned a Tony Award nomination for Best Actor in a Play and drew praise for his commanding stage presence and rapid adaptation to live performance demands.\n\n### 2020–present: Health interruptions, recent films, and theater revival\n\nIn March 2020, Tom Hanks and his wife Rita Wilson tested positive for COVID-19 while in Queensland, Australia, where Hanks was preparing to film his role in the Elvis biopic; they experienced mild symptoms, were briefly hospitalized, and quarantined on location before returning to the United States in April. This early high-profile diagnosis, announced via social media on March 11, heightened public awareness of the pandemic's spread beyond initial hotspots.\n\nHanks resumed work amid production delays, with *Greyhound* releasing exclusively on Apple TV+ on July 10, 2020; he starred as Commander Ernest Krause, a U.S. Navy officer shepherding a convoy of 37 Allied ships across the Atlantic during World War II while evading German U-boat attacks, adapting C.S. Forester's 1955 novel *The Good Shepherd* for the screenplay. In 2021, *Finch* debuted on Apple TV+ on November 5, depicting Hanks as a robotics engineer in a solar-ravaged post-apocalyptic America who builds a robot companion to care for his dog during a cross-country journey.\n\nThe year 2022 brought multiple releases: in *Elvis*, directed by Baz Luhrmann and released June 24, Hanks portrayed the controversial promoter Colonel Tom Parker, Elvis Presley's manager, whose decisions shaped the singer's career and finances. *A Man Called Otto*, a U.S. remake of the Swedish film *A Man Called Ove* released December 29 in limited theaters (expanding January 2023), featured Hanks as a curmudgeonly retiree whose isolation cracks through neighborly interactions, earning $64.3 million domestically and $113.4 million worldwide against a $50 million budget. Hanks also voiced Geppetto, the woodcarver who crafts the puppet Pinocchio in memory of his deceased son, in Robert Zemeckis's live-action/animated Disney+ adaptation released September 8.\n\nIn 2024, Hanks reunited with Zemeckis for *Here*, released November 1, a drama spanning generations in a single fixed-location living room using de-aging visual effects to portray characters across time, co-starring Robin Wright as his onscreen spouse and reflecting on their three-decade collaboration since *Forrest Gump*. By 2025, Hanks had co-written and starred in the Off-Broadway premiere of *This World of Tomorrow* at The Shed in New York, beginning previews October 30; the time-travel play, based on his short stories and co-authored with James Glossman, casts him as a disillusioned future scientist seeking lost simplicity alongside Kelli O'Hara. That year, he narrated NBC's 10-part documentary series *The Americas*, which premiered February 23 with a two-hour special, exploring ecosystems and wildlife from Alaska to Patagonia, scored by Hans Zimmer.\n\n## Producing and other professional ventures\n\n### Playtone Productions\n\nPlaytone Productions was established in 1998 by Tom Hanks and producer Gary Goetzman as a film and television production company based in Los Angeles.\n\nAmong its early theatrical successes, Playtone produced *My Big Fat Greek Wedding* (2002), a romantic comedy that achieved the highest domestic gross for an independent film to date at $241 million on a budget of approximately $5 million. The company followed with *The Polar Express* (2004), an animated adaptation that advanced motion-capture technology and contributed to Playtone's growing portfolio of family-oriented features. In 2008, Playtone served as executive producer on *Mamma Mia!*, a jukebox musical that generated $610 million in worldwide box office revenue. The company also backed *Where the Wild Things Are* (2009), a live-action adaptation of Maurice Sendak's children's book that emphasized visual effects despite mixed critical reception.\n\nPlaytone expanded into prestige television through partnerships, notably co-producing HBO's *Band of Brothers* (2001), a World War II miniseries depicting the U.S. Army's Easy Company, which secured seven Primetime Emmy Awards out of 19 nominations. This project exemplified Playtone's emphasis on ensemble casts and historical accuracy in military narratives, a pattern continued with *The Pacific* (2010), another HBO miniseries focused on U.S. Marines in the Pacific theater that earned multiple Emmy nominations.\n\nIn recent years, Playtone produced *Masters of the Air* (2024), an Apple TV+ miniseries chronicling the U.S. Army Air Forces' 100th Bomb Group during World War II, which recorded Apple's most-watched series premiere to date based on initial viewership metrics. Overall, Playtone's HBO collaborations have amassed 46 Emmy wins from 113 nominations, underscoring the company's track record in high-budget, fact-based ensemble productions centered on American military history.\n\n### Directing and writing efforts\n\nHanks's directorial debut came with the 1996 comedy-drama *That Thing You Do!*, which he also wrote as his first feature screenplay, chronicling the meteoric but fleeting rise of a fictional 1960s rock band from Erie, Pennsylvania. The film, released on October 4, 1996, featured original songs with lyrics co-written by Hanks, including the title track, and served as a launchpad for emerging talent under his Playtone banner, such as actors Giovanni Ribisi and Steve Zahn. Critics noted its nostalgic evocation of early rock enthusiasm tempered by the era's commercial pressures, though it earned modest box office returns of approximately $13 million domestically against a $10 million budget.\n\nHis second and most recent feature as director was *Larry Crowne* in 2011, a romantic comedy he co-wrote with Nia Vardalos and in which he starred alongside Julia Roberts, depicting a middle-aged man's reinvention through community college after corporate downsizing. Drawing from Hanks's observations of economic displacement, the film premiered on July 1, 2011, but received mixed reception for its earnest sentimentality and predictable plotting, grossing $72 million worldwide on a $30 million budget. \n\nBeyond directing, Hanks has contributed screenplays to other projects, including adapting his 2019 novella *Uncommon Type* into the script for the World War II thriller *Greyhound* (2020), which he executive produced but did not direct. In theater, he co-wrote the 2025 Off-Broadway play *This World of Tomorrow* with James Glossman, a science-fiction narrative centered on a 21st-century scientist's time-travel quest driven by personal longing, which premiered at The Shed in New York featuring Hanks in the lead role of Bert Allenberry opposite Kelli O'Hara. The work explores themes of temporal displacement and emotional reconnection, marking Hanks's return to stage writing amid his selective behind-the-camera pursuits.\n\n## Literary contributions\n\n### Published works\n\nTom Hanks entered literary fiction with short stories, beginning with \"Alan Bean Plus Four,\" published in *The New Yorker* on October 27, 2014, which depicts four friends attempting a moon landing in the style of 1960s space race adventures. In 2017, he released his debut collection, *Uncommon Type: Some Stories*, on October 17 via Alfred A. Knopf, comprising 17 tales unified by the motif of typewriters—reflecting Hanks's personal collection of over 100 vintage models—exploring themes of everyday life, regret, and whimsy through concise, character-focused narratives akin to his film roles. \n\nThe collection achieved commercial success as a *New York Times* bestseller, lauded by some for its accessible prose and gentle humanism, evoking a \"kinder, gentler world\" in ordinary American vignettes, science fiction snippets, and mock newspaper columns. However, critical reception was mixed, with detractors citing blandness, clichés, and \"special banality of mere competence,\" rendering stories forgettable despite technical polish. \n\nHanks expanded into longer-form fiction with his first novel, *The Making of Another Major Motion Picture Masterpiece*, published May 9, 2023, by Alfred A. Knopf, tracing the evolution of a fictional superhero film from a 1940s comic book to modern production, blending historical flashbacks, Hollywood satire, and family drama across five generations. Reviewers noted its sparkling wit and curiosity-driven detail but criticized narrative sagging under excessive minutiae, marking a shift from short-form brevity to expansive, film-industry-infused storytelling. No further short fiction collections or novels have been published as of 2025, with Hanks's output limited to these verified works outside screenplays and play scripts.\n\n## Awards and honors\n\n### Major film awards\n\nTom Hanks earned two Academy Awards for Best Actor, a rare consecutive achievement, for his portrayal of Andrew Beckett, a lawyer with AIDS, in *Philadelphia* (1993) at the 66th ceremony on March 21, 1994, and for Forrest Gump, a developmentally disabled man reflecting on American history, in *Forrest Gump* (1994) at the 67th ceremony on March 27, 1995.\n\nHe secured four Golden Globe Awards for Best Actor in a Motion Picture, highlighting his versatility across comedy and drama: for *Big* (1988) in the Musical or Comedy category at the 46th ceremony on January 28, 1989; *Philadelphia* in Drama at the 51st on January 22, 1994; *Forrest Gump* in Drama at the 52nd on January 21, 1995; and *Cast Away* (2000) in Drama at the 58th on January 21, 2001.\n\nAt the inaugural Screen Actors Guild Awards on March 4, 1995, Hanks won the first Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role for *Forrest Gump*, flashing his SAG card onstage to emphasize the guild's peer-driven recognition.\n\nThese wins, concentrated in the mid-1990s, marked the peak of Hanks's critical acclaim for dramatic roles, though he received further Best Actor Oscar nominations for *Big* (1989 ceremony), *Apollo 13* (1996), *Saving Private Ryan* (1999), *Captain Phillips* (2014), *Bridge of Spies* (2016), and *Sully* (2017), underscoring sustained industry regard without additional victories.\n\n### Other recognitions and lifetime achievements\n\nIn 2016, Hanks received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Barack Obama, recognizing his contributions to American culture through film. This honor, the highest civilian award in the United States, highlighted his role in portraying quintessentially American characters and advancing historical narratives.\n\nHanks was awarded the Cecil B. DeMille Award at the 77th Golden Globe Awards on January 5, 2020, for outstanding contributions to the world of entertainment over his lifetime. The award acknowledged his versatile career spanning comedies, dramas, and voice roles. In 2014, he received the Kennedy Center Honors, celebrating his lifetime artistic achievements alongside honorees like Sting and Lily Tomlin.\n\nEarlier, in 2002, Hanks became the youngest recipient of the American Film Institute's Life Achievement Award at age 46, honoring his profound impact on American cinema. In June 2025, the West Point Association of Graduates selected him for the Sylvanus Thayer Award, given annually since 1958 to an outstanding U.S. citizen for unselfish service to society; the award cited his public service through historical films depicting military valor, such as those on World War II, though the planned ceremony was canceled in September to prioritize cadet preparation.\n\nHanks ranks among the highest-grossing actors worldwide, with his films accumulating over $10.9 billion in global box office earnings across 58 movies as of 2025. His voice performance as Woody in the *Toy Story* franchise has contributed significantly to its success, with the series grossing billions and earning nominations for him in categories like Favorite Voice from an Animated Movie at the People's Choice Awards.\n\n## Legacy and public perception\n\n### Cultural influence and iconic roles\n\nTom Hanks' portrayal of Forrest Gump in the 1994 film *Forrest Gump* has profoundly influenced popular culture through its depiction of unyielding optimism amid historical turmoil, with quotable lines such as \"Life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get\" becoming enduring memes and references in media and everyday discourse.  The character's naive resilience, witnessing events from the Vietnam War to civil rights movements, provoked reflection on American history while emphasizing personal perseverance over cynicism.\n\nIn the *Toy Story* franchise, Hanks voiced Woody, the loyal cowboy doll, contributing to a series that revolutionized family animation as the first feature-length computer-animated film in 1995, establishing a blueprint for Pixar and Disney productions focused on themes of friendship and growth.  Woody's archetype of steadfast leadership amid rivalry shaped depictions of relatable heroism in animated storytelling, sustaining cultural relevance across four films spanning 1995 to 2019.\n\nHanks' role as Captain John Miller in *Saving Private Ryan* (1998) introduced unprecedented realism to World War II portrayals, particularly through the Omaha Beach D-Day sequence, which altered cinematic depictions of combat by prioritizing visceral, limited-perspective brutality over glorified heroism. This approach renewed public interest in WWII narratives, influencing subsequent films, television, and games by grounding military stories in empirical chaos and squad-level sacrifice.\n\nAs astronaut Jim Lovell in *Apollo 13* (1995), Hanks embodied technical ingenuity and collective resilience during the 1970 mission's crisis, reinforcing perceptions of NASA's valor and human adaptability in space exploration, which rekindled audience appreciation for real engineering triumphs over fatalistic views of failure.  These roles collectively advanced the \"everyman\" archetype in Hollywood, portraying ordinary individuals thrust into crises who prevail through grit and cooperation, countering escapist tropes with causal depictions of earned heroism. \n\n### Reputation as an actor and producer\n\nTom Hanks has cultivated a reputation as \"America's Dad,\" embodying a wholesome, everyman persona that resonates with audiences through his approachable demeanor and relatable characters. This image stems from his consistent portrayal of decent, resilient figures in both comedic and dramatic roles, earning praise for his versatility across genres. His films have amassed over $11.8 billion in worldwide box office earnings, underscoring his commercial reliability.\n\nHanks' collaborations with directors like Steven Spielberg and Robert Zemeckis have bolstered his standing in historical dramas, where his performances contribute to projects emphasizing factual grounding over embellishment. Films such as *Saving Private Ryan* and *The Pacific* highlight this partnership, with Hanks' involvement signaling commitment to authentic depictions of wartime experiences.\n\nAs a producer, Hanks has elevated ensemble-driven narratives focused on realism, notably through *Band of Brothers*, which he co-executive produced with Spielberg. The miniseries drew acclaim for its meticulous recreation of Easy Company's World War II exploits, prioritizing veteran interviews and period authenticity to convey the unvarnished realities of combat. Hanks emphasized practical effects and historical consultation to avoid sensationalism, fostering trust in productions that resist contemporary ideological overlays.\n\nCritics have occasionally faulted Hanks for typecasting in sentimental roles, as seen in *Larry Crowne* (2011), where reviewers noted the film's overly gentle, fairy-tale tone amid economic themes, diluting dramatic tension with unearned optimism. More recently, his 2025 *Saturday Night Live* appearance prompted observations of reduced vigor, with viewers citing shaky delivery in sketches as indicative of waning physical dynamism. Despite such critiques, his core appeal endures through disciplined craftsmanship rather than flashy reinvention.\n\n### Controversies, criticisms, and debunked claims\n\nIn March 2020, Tom Hanks and his wife Rita Wilson tested positive for COVID-19 while in Australia, leading to quarantine; this event was misconstrued by QAnon adherents and online conspiracy theorists who falsely linked him to pedophilia rings, including unsubstantiated claims of involvement with Jeffrey Epstein's network, based on misinterpreted social media posts about mask-wearing and symbolic imagery like a glove emoji.  No credible evidence supported these accusations, which originated from fringe social media and were repeatedly debunked as fabrications exploiting Hanks' public health disclosures without forensic or testimonial backing. \n\nDuring the February 17, 2025, *Saturday Night Live* 50th anniversary special, Hanks reprised his 2016 \"Black Jeopardy\" character Doug, a MAGA hat-wearing Trump supporter depicted as awkwardly navigating racial dynamics, such as hesitating to shake the Black host's hand; conservative commentators and social media users criticized the sketch for stereotyping right-leaning voters as inherently racist or ignorant, prompting calls for boycotts despite Hanks' established \"America's Dad\" persona.   Figures like Megyn Kelly labeled it a \"racist\" portrayal of MAGA supporters, arguing it alienated half the electorate, while defenders viewed it as satirical exaggeration rooted in the original skit's premise. \n\nIn her April 2025 memoir *The 10: A Memoir of Family and the Open Road*, Hanks' daughter E.A. Hanks (Elizabeth Ann) alleged physical and emotional abuse by her late mother, Samantha Lewes (Hanks' first wife, divorced in 1987), including neglect and violence during periods of Lewes' primary custody, amid the mother's untreated mental health issues; Hanks publicly endorsed the book as \"very honest,\" stating he was \"not surprised\" and that \"we all come from checkered, cracked lives,\" without disputing the claims or attributing blame.  \n\nOn November 6, 2024, during a *Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend* podcast episode promoting the 25th anniversary rerelease of *That Thing You Do!*, Hanks delivered a humorous rant dismissing film critics' influence, calling them \"cocksuckers\" and asserting that a movie's enduring value is determined by audience time investment over reviews, as evidenced by the film's cult following despite initial mixed reception.  The comment, delivered in jest amid laughter, drew attention for its vulgarity but aligned with Hanks' broader defense of populist metrics like viewership longevity against elite critique.\n\n## Personal life\n\n### Marriages and family\n\nTom Hanks married actress Samantha Lewes (born Susan Dillingham) in 1978 after meeting as theater students at California State University, Sacramento; the couple divorced in 1987. They had two children: son Colin Hanks, born July 24, 1977, who has worked as an actor and director in films such as *Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle*, and daughter Elizabeth Ann \"E.A.\" Hanks, born May 17, 1982, a writer and story analyst.\n\nHanks married Greek-American actress Rita Wilson on April 30, 1988, after meeting on the set of the sitcom *Bosom Buddies*; the couple remains married as of 2025. They have two sons: Chester \"Chet\" Marlon Hanks, born August 4, 1990, an actor and rapper who has discussed personal struggles with addiction, and Truman Theodore Hanks, born December 6, 1995, a filmmaker.\n\nThrough his paternal lineage, Hanks is the third cousin four times removed of President Abraham Lincoln, sharing common ancestor John Hanks (1680–1740) via Lincoln's mother, Nancy Hanks. Hanks has supported his children's careers, including casting Colin in projects like the *Band of Brothers* miniseries he produced.\n\n### Health issues\n\nIn October 2013, Hanks publicly disclosed his diagnosis of type 2 diabetes during an appearance on *Late Show with David Letterman*, attributing it to decades of fluctuating blood sugar levels exacerbated by repeated cycles of significant weight gain and loss for film roles. He described ignoring medical warnings about his \"yo-yo dieting\" habits, which involved rapid changes in body weight, as a key factor leading to the condition.\n\nHanks' weight alterations for roles included losing approximately 26 pounds for his portrayal of an AIDS-afflicted lawyer in the 1993 film *Philadelphia*, achieved through a controlled but grueling regimen that left him feeling \"woozy\" during production. Such extreme transformations, repeated across multiple projects, contributed to the metabolic stress he later connected to his diabetes onset.\n\nOn March 11, 2020, Hanks and his wife Rita Wilson tested positive for COVID-19 while in Queensland, Australia, for pre-production on an Elvis Presley biopic, marking one of the earliest high-profile U.S. celebrity cases and prompting their hospitalization for monitoring due to symptoms including fatigue, colds, and body aches. They were discharged after about a week and entered self-isolation, with Hanks reporting gradual improvement and full recovery by late March, allowing their return to the United States.\n\nAs of 2025, at age 69, Hanks has reported no major ongoing health complications, managing his diabetes through sustained weight loss, exercise, and dietary adjustments initiated post-diagnosis, while stating he feels in better physical condition than during his 30s due to disciplined habits and reduced stressors like raising young children. He has emphasized resilience in aging, viewing his 60s as preferable to earlier decades marked by metabolic slowdowns, without indications of debilitating issues impeding his professional output.\n\n### Political engagement and philanthropy\n\nHanks has consistently supported Democratic candidates and causes, including a $30,800 donation to the DNC Services Corp on May 31, 2012. He endorsed Barack Obama in 2008 and subsequent Democratic presidential campaigns through Joe Biden in 2020, reflecting a pattern of alignment with the party's platforms. This engagement has drawn criticism for exemplifying Hollywood elitism, particularly in portrayals and commentary perceived as dismissive of conservative viewpoints, such as in depictions of MAGA supporters.\n\nIn 2025, the West Point Association of Graduates selected Hanks as recipient of the Sylvanus Thayer Award, recognizing his service to the nation through advocacy for veterans and patriotic filmmaking, though the planned ceremony was canceled to refocus on the academy's core mission of training leaders. The decision faced backlash, with former President Trump praising the cancellation and labeling Hanks \"woke,\" highlighting tensions between his left-leaning politics and recognition for military-themed contributions.\n\nHanks' philanthropy emphasizes support for veterans, including advocacy for funding the National World War II Memorial in Washington, D.C., where he urged congressional appropriations beyond the initial 10% allocation in 1999. He co-founded the Hanx coffee brand in 2022, directing 100% of profits to organizations aiding military members and veterans' families, such as the Bob Woodruff Foundation and others focused on injury recovery and service support. Contributions from Hanks and his wife Rita Wilson also back the WWII Foundation and related initiatives preserving military history.\n\nHis interest in World War II history informs this work, stemming from projects like *Saving Private Ryan*, which spurred broader veteran advocacy. Countering perceptions of detachment, Hanks rode the New York City subway incognito on October 21, 2025, blending with commuters in everyday attire, an act underscoring personal relatability amid critiques of celebrity insulation.",
