Bordered by Germany, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia, Italy, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein, Austria spans an area of approximately 83,879 square kilometers (32,386 square miles) and has a population of about 9 million people as of 2023.

Austria is renowned for its Alpine landscapes, historical architecture, and contributions to classical music, being the birthplace of composers like Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Johann Strauss. A member of the European Union (EU) since 1995, Austria plays a significant role in European politics and economics while maintaining a policy of neutrality [CIA World Factbook](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/austria/).\n\n## Historical Background\nAustria's history is deeply intertwined with the broader narrative of Central Europe, marked by periods of imperial dominance, conflict, and transformation.\n\n- **Early History**: The region now known as Austria was inhabited by Celtic tribes before becoming part of the Roman Empire around 15 BCE. After the fall of Rome, it was settled by Germanic tribes and later became part of the Frankish Empire under Charlemagne.\n- **Habsburg Dynasty**: From the 13th century, Austria emerged as a key territory under the Habsburg family, who ruled vast swathes of Europe for centuries. The Habsburgs established Vienna as a cultural and political center, and by the 16th century, their empire included modern-day Austria, Hungary, and parts of Italy and Spain [Encyclopaedia Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/place/Austria/History).\n- **Austro-Hungarian Empire**: In 1867, the Austro-Hungarian Compromise created a dual monarchy between Austria and Hungary, lasting until the empire's dissolution after World War I in 1918. The Treaty of Saint-Germain (1919) redefined Austria's borders and prohibited union with Germany [History.com](https://www.history.com/topics/europe/austria-hungary).\n- **20th Century**: Austria faced significant upheaval during the 20th century. It was annexed by Nazi Germany in 1938 (the *Anschluss*), becoming part of the Third Reich until the end of World War II in 1945. Post-war, Austria was occupied by Allied forces until 1955, when it regained full sovereignty under the condition of permanent neutrality through the Austrian State Treaty [Austrian Federal Chancellery](https://www.bundeskanzleramt.gv.at/en/topics/austrian-history.html).\n- **Modern Era**: Since 1955, Austria has maintained its neutrality, focusing on diplomacy and peacekeeping. It joined the United Nations in 1955 and the European Union in 1995, marking its integration into broader European frameworks.\n\n## Current Status and Relevance\nToday, Austria is a federal parliamentary republic with a high standard of living and a robust economy.
