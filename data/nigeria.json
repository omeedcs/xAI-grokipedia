It is bordered by Niger to the north, Chad and Cameroon to the east, Benin to the west, and the Gulf of Guinea to the south. With a population of over 200 million people, Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa and the seventh most populous in the world. Its capital is Abuja, while Lagos serves as the economic and cultural hub. Nigeria is a culturally diverse nation, home to over 250 ethnic groups and languages, with English as the official language [CIA World Factbook](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/nigeria/).\n\nNigeria's economy is one of the largest in Africa, driven by oil production, agriculture, and a growing technology sector. However, the country faces challenges such as political instability, corruption, and economic inequality. This article provides an in-depth look at Nigeria's history, current status, notable facts, and related topics.\n\n## Historical Background\n\nNigeria's history is rich and complex, spanning thousands of years of indigenous civilizations, colonial rule, and post-independence struggles.\n\n- **Pre-Colonial Era**: Before European contact, Nigeria was home to several advanced kingdoms and empires, including the Kingdom of Nri (9th century), the Oyo Empire, the Kingdom of Benin, and the Hausa city-states. These societies were known for their intricate political systems, trade networks, and artistic achievements, such as the famous Benin Bronzes [BBC History - Nigeria](https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/topics/nigeria).\n- **Colonial Period**: In the late 19th century, Britain established control over the region, amalgamating the northern and southern protectorates in 1914 to form the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria. Colonial rule exploited local resources, particularly palm oil and later oil, while introducing Western education and Christianity alongside existing Islamic and traditional beliefs [Encyclopedia Britannica - Nigeria](https://www.britannica.com/place/Nigeria).\n- **Independence and Civil War**: Nigeria gained independence from Britain on October 1, 1960. However, ethnic tensions and political instability led to the Nigerian Civil War (1967–1970), also known as the Biafran War, when the southeastern region attempted to secede as the Republic of Biafra. The conflict resulted in millions of deaths due to violence and famine [History.com - Nigerian Civil War](https://www.history.com/topics/africa/nigerian-civil-war).\n- **Post-Independence Era**: Since the war, Nigeria has experienced periods of military rule and democratic governance. The return to civilian rule in 1999 marked a significant milestone, though challenges like corruption and insurgency persist [Council on Foreign Relations - Nigeria](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/nigerias-struggle-democracy).\n\n## Current Status and Relevance\n\nNigeria plays a pivotal role in African and global affairs due to its economic power, cultural influence, and strategic location.\n\n- **Political Landscape**: Nigeria operates as a federal presidential republic, with a president as the head of state and government. The country is divided into 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory. Political instability and corruption remain significant issues, though democratic institutions have strengthened since 1999 [Freedom House - Nigeria](https://freedomhouse.org/country/nigeria).\n- **Economy**: Nigeria's economy is Africa's largest by nominal GDP, driven by oil exports, which account for a significant portion of government revenue. However, over-reliance on oil has led to economic volatility. Other sectors like agriculture, telecommunications, and entertainment (notably Nollywood, the second-largest film industry globally) are growing [World Bank - Nigeria](https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/nigeria).\n- **Social Issues**: Nigeria faces challenges such as poverty, with over 40% of the population living below the poverty line, and security threats from groups like Boko Haram in the northeast. Access to education and healthcare remains limited in many regions [UNICEF - Nigeria](https://www.unicef.org/nigeria/).\n- **Global Influence**: As a member of the United Nations, African Union, and OPEC, Nigeria is a key player in international diplomacy. Its cultural exports, including music genres like Afrobeats, have gained worldwide popularity [Al Jazeera - Afrobeats](https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2022/10/1/how-afrobeats-is-taking-over-the-world).\n\n## Notable Facts and Details\n\n- **Demographics**: Nigeria is home to over 200 million people, with major ethnic groups including the Hausa, Yoruba, and Igbo.

Festivals like the Durbar and traditional dishes like jollof rice are iconic [UNESCO - Nigerian Culture](https://en.unesco.org/creativity/sites/creativity/files/nigeria_cultural_policy_en.pdf).\n- **Challenges**: Issues like environmental degradation due to oil spills in the Niger Delta, high unemployment, and inadequate infrastructure hinder development [Amnesty International - Niger Delta](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2021/06/niger-delta-oil-spills-decoders/).\n\n## Related Topics\n\n- **Nollywood**: Nigeria's film industry, based in Lagos, produces thousands of movies annually, making it a global cultural phenomenon.\n- **Boko Haram**: An Islamist insurgent group active in northern Nigeria, responsible for widespread violence and displacement since 2009.\n- **Niger Delta**: A region rich in oil but plagued by environmental issues and conflict over resource control.\n- **Afrobeats**: A music genre originating in Nigeria, blending traditional sounds with modern influences, popularized by artists like Burna Boy and Wizkid.\n\n## References\n\n- [CIA World Factbook - Nigeria](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/nigeria/)\n- [BBC History - Nigeria](https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/topics/nigeria)\n- [Encyclopedia Britannica - Nigeria](https://www.britannica.com/place/Nigeria)\n- [History.com - Nigerian Civil War](https://www.history.com/topics/africa/nigerian-civil-war)\n- [Council on Foreign Relations - Nigeria](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/nigerias-struggle-democracy)\n- [Freedom House - Nigeria](https://freedomhouse.org/country/nigeria)\n- [World Bank - Nigeria](https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/nigeria)\n- [UNICEF - Nigeria](https://www.unicef.org/nigeria/)\n- [Al Jazeera - Afrobeats](https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2022/10/1/how-afrobeats-is-taking-over-the-world)\n- [Ethnologue - Nigeria](https://www.ethnologue.com/country/NG)\n- [National Geographic - Niger River](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/niger-river/)\n- [UNESCO - Nigerian Culture](https://en.unesco.org/creativity/sites/creativity/files/nigeria_cultural_policy_en.pdf)\n- [Amnesty International - Niger Delta](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2021/06/niger-delta-oil-spills-decoders/)",
