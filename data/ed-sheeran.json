  "content": "# Ed Sheeran\n\nEdward Christopher Sheeran MBE (born 17 February 1991) is an English singer-songwriter and musician recognized for his blend of pop, folk, and hip-hop influences delivered through acoustic guitar and live looping techniques. Rising from independent releases and busking in London, Sheeran signed with Asylum Records in 2011, launching a career marked by consistent chart dominance and genre-blending songcraft.\n\nSheeran's commercial breakthrough came with his second album, × (2014), which produced the global hits \"Thinking Out Loud\" and \"Photograph,\" the former earning him Grammy Awards for Song of the Year and Best Pop Solo Performance in 2016. His third album, ÷ (2017), shattered streaming records with singles like \"Shape of You,\" which won Best Pop Solo Performance at the 2018 Grammys and became one of the most streamed songs ever. By 2025, Sheeran had secured four Grammy wins overall, alongside multiple Brit Awards, and released his eighth studio album, *Play*, which debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart, marking his ninth such achievement there.\n\nWith reported pure album and single sales approaching 100 million units globally, augmented by billions of streams, Sheeran ranks among the highest-grossing live acts, exemplified by his ÷ Tour (2017–2019), one of the decade's top earners. His work has faced legal scrutiny, notably a 2024 U.S. court victory defending \"Thinking Out Loud\" against copyright claims akin to Marvin Gaye's \"Let's Get It On,\" underscoring tensions in pop music's reliance on familiar chord progressions. Sheeran's unpretentious persona and prolific output—spanning mathematical-symbol-titled albums like = (2021) and - (2023)—have sustained his appeal amid evolving industry dynamics.\n\n## Early life\n\n### Family background and childhood\n\nEdward Sheeran was born Edward Christopher Sheeran on 17 February 1991 at the Royal Halifax Infirmary in Halifax, West Yorkshire, England. His parents, John and Imogen Sheeran, both pursued careers in the arts—John as a lecturer and curator specializing in Caravaggio exhibitions, and Imogen as a designer of jewellery and visual arts. The couple, originally from London, raised Sheeran alongside his older brother Matthew, who later became a composer for film and classical music. Sheeran's paternal grandparents emigrated from Ireland, with his grandfather William Sheeran from Belfast and grandmother Nancy Mulligan from County Tipperary, instilling a connection to Irish heritage that influenced his later songwriting.\n\nThe family relocated to Framlingham, Suffolk, when Sheeran was approximately four years old, seeking a rural environment that aligned with their artistic lifestyles. In this setting, Sheeran was immersed in a household emphasizing creativity, with frequent exposure to music and visual arts from his parents' professional circles. He exhibited early musical aptitude, beginning to perform and write songs as a child, often drawing from folk influences prevalent in the family's collection.\n\nDuring his childhood, Sheeran contended with a pronounced stutter that affected his speech, a challenge he addressed by practicing rapid-fire rapping to Eminem albums, which helped build fluency through rhythmic delivery. This period also saw him embracing his distinctive red hair and physical traits, including a birthmark, amid a self-described \"weird\" persona that fostered resilience. The supportive family dynamic encouraged his pursuits without formal pressure, laying foundational habits for his independent musical development.\n\n### Education and initial musical pursuits\n\nSheeran attended Thomas Mills High School in Framlingham, Suffolk, where he completed his General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) qualifications, including an A grade in art. His academic performance in music was weaker during this period. He left the school at age 16 in 2007 to pursue a music career full-time, forgoing further post-GCSE studies such as A-levels. \n\nFrom an early age, Sheeran engaged in musical activities, beginning with singing in his local church choir at age four. He received his first guitar around age 11 and self-taught the instrument, drawing initial inspiration from performers like Eric Clapton. During his school years, he began composing original songs and participated in local performances, including an audition for the television series *Britannia High* in 2007 at age 16. He also reunited with a middle school band to perform covers such as \"Teenage Dirtbag\" over two decades later, highlighting early group efforts.\n\nFollowing his departure from school, Sheeran relocated to London at age 17 in 2008, where he supported himself through odd jobs including newspaper delivery and pizza preparation while busking on streets and performing at open mic nights to build experience and exposure. These grassroots efforts marked the transition from school-based pursuits to independent professional development, culminating in early independent releases by 2005 despite his youth.\n\n## Career\n\n### 2004–2010: Independent beginnings and early releases\n\nSheeran began recording music in 2004 at age 13, independently releasing his debut collection *Spinning Man* that year by personally burning CDs and creating covers for 14 tracks, including songs like \"I Love You.\") This self-produced effort marked his initial foray into distributing original acoustic and folk-influenced material, drawing from personal experiences and early songwriting. In 2005, he followed with *The Orange Room EP*, a five-track release featuring songs such as \"Moody Ballad of Ed,\" \"Misery,\" and \"Addicted,\" which showcased his developing singer-songwriter style rooted in indie folk and emotional ballads.\n\nBy 2006, Sheeran issued a self-titled EP containing 13 tracks that expanded on his raw, loop-pedal-assisted performances, often recorded in home setups. This period saw continued independent output, including the 2007 EP *Want Some?*, which highlighted his growing experimentation with hip-hop elements alongside acoustic roots. In 2008, at age 17, Sheeran relocated from Suffolk to London to intensify his career pursuits, performing over 300 gigs annually in small venues and busking at locations like train stations to hone his live act and build a grassroots audience. His sets typically featured original compositions and covers, emphasizing vocal delivery and minimal instrumentation.\n\nSheeran's independent momentum accelerated in 2009 with the release of *You Need Me, I Don't Need You EP*, a track that later gained traction for its defiant lyrics on industry independence. By 2010, he produced *Loose Change EP* and *Songs I Wrote with Amy*, the latter a collaborative effort with songwriter Amy Wadge yielding introspective tracks like \"Fire Alarms\" and \"Cold Coffee,\" distributed via limited CD runs and online platforms. These releases, alongside performances at events like the Ipswich Arts Festival in July 2010, solidified his reputation in the UK underground scene, relying on self-promotion without major label support. Throughout 2004–2010, Sheeran's output totaled several EPs with low production runs, focusing on authenticity over commercial polish, and he supported emerging acts while opening for established artists like Just Jack.\n\n### 2011–2013: Breakthrough with + (\"Plus\")\n\n![Ed Sheeran performing at the 2012 Frequency Festival][float-right]\nFollowing an appearance on the BBC's *Later... with Jools Holland* on 26 April 2011, Sheeran signed with Asylum Records, an imprint of Atlantic Records. His debut major-label studio album, *+*, was released in September 2011 and debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart.\n\nThe album's lead single, \"The A Team\", released on 10 June 2011, peaked at number three on the UK Singles Chart. Subsequent singles from *+* included \"You Need Me, I Don't Need You\" (released 26 August 2011, peaking at number four), \"Lego House\" (13 November 2011), \"Drunk\" (19 February 2012), and \"Give Me Love\" (18 November 2011 as a double A-side with \"Lego House\" re-release). These tracks contributed to the album's commercial success, with *+* certified 9× Platinum in the UK by 2018 for sales exceeding 2.7 million units.\n\nSheeran supported the album with the + Tour, his first headlining tour comprising 97 dates across two years, including extensive UK and international performances starting in late 2011. In recognition of his breakthrough, Sheeran won British Male Solo Artist and British Breakthrough Act at the 2012 Brit Awards.  \"The A Team\" also received the Ivor Novello Award for Best Song Musically and Lyrically in 2012.\n\n### 2014–2015: Commercial expansion with × (\"Multiply\")\n\nEd Sheeran's second studio album, × (pronounced \"multiply\"), was released on 23 June 2014 by Asylum Records. The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart in the United States, selling 210,000 copies in its first week ending 29 June 2014. In the United Kingdom, × became the best-selling artist album of 2014 up to October, surpassing competitors with strong physical and digital sales.\n\nThe lead single \"Sing\", featuring Pharrell Williams, was released on 1 June 2014 and peaked at number one on the UK Singles Chart. Subsequent singles included \"Don't\" in October 2014, which reached number one in the UK after a streaming boost, \"Thinking Out Loud\" in November 2014, topping charts in multiple countries, and \"Photograph\" in 2015, achieving platinum status. By December 2015, four singles from × had each earned platinum certification in the US, contributing to the album's global sales exceeding 10 million units.\n\nSheeran launched the x Tour, also known as the Multiply Tour, to promote the album, commencing in 2014 with dates across Europe, North America, and Australia, extending into 2015. The tour culminated major shows, including stadium performances, and earned him the Breakthrough award at the 2015 Billboard Touring Awards for its commercial impact. In the UK, × sales surpassed 2 million copies by March 2015, with its second million achieved in just 15 weeks, faster than the first, driven by hits like \"Thinking Out Loud\".\n\nGlobally, × amassed over 9 million equivalent album sales by later analyses, marking it as Sheeran's breakthrough to mainstream commercial dominance following his debut +. The album's success solidified his position as a top-selling artist, with sustained chart performance reflecting broad appeal through acoustic pop and ballad elements.\n\n### 2016–2018: Global dominance with ÷ (\"Divide\")\n\nFollowing a self-imposed hiatus from social media and new music releases after the completion of his Multiply Tour in 2015, Sheeran announced his return with two new singles, \"Shape of You\" and \"Castle on the Hill\", on January 6, 2017. These tracks debuted at numbers one and two, respectively, on the UK Singles Chart, marking the first time an artist achieved this feat with simultaneous releases. \"Shape of You\" became Sheeran's first number-one single as a lead artist on the Billboard Hot 100, where it held the top position for 12 non-consecutive weeks, and was certified as the best-selling global single of 2017 by the IFPI.\n\nThe third studio album, ÷ (pronounced \"Divide\"), followed on March 3, 2017, via Asylum and Atlantic Records, debuting at number one on the Billboard 200 with 451,000 album-equivalent units, including 322,000 pure album sales in its first week. In the UK, it sold 672,000 units in its debut week, the third-fastest sales week for an album in the country's history at that time. The album was named the best-selling of 2017 worldwide, with over 9.6 million equivalent units by year's end, and topped annual charts in the United States according to Nielsen Music data.\n\nThe supporting ÷ Tour commenced on March 16, 2017, featuring minimalist production with Sheeran performing solo with a loop pedal, guitar, and beatbox in stadiums worldwide. By the end of 2018, the tour had grossed $432 million in ticket sales that year alone, setting a record for the highest earnings by any artist in a single calendar year. Performances included high-profile stadium residencies, such as four nights at London's Wembley Stadium generating $28.7 million.\n\nAt the 60th Annual Grammy Awards on January 28, 2018, ÷ won Best Pop Vocal Album, Sheeran's first victory in that category, recognizing its commercial and artistic impact. The era solidified Sheeran's position as a dominant force in global music, with ÷ contributing to a more than 10% rise in UK music industry sales in 2017, driven by its streaming and physical sales performance.\n\n### 2019–2022: Collaborations and = (\"Equals\")\n\nIn July 2019, Sheeran released *No.6 Collaborations Project*, his fourth studio album and first dedicated to collaborations, featuring 15 tracks with artists including Justin Bieber, Khalid, Camila Cabello, Cardi B, Chance the Rapper, and Bruno Mars.  The album debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart and remained there for four consecutive weeks, driven by singles such as \"I Don't Care\" with Bieber, which reached number one in multiple countries including the UK and Australia.  Following the conclusion of his Divide Tour on 16 August 2019, which grossed over $776 million and became the highest-grossing tour in history at the time, Sheeran announced a hiatus from music and social media to prioritize his marriage and personal life.\n\nDuring 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Sheeran maintained a low public profile, with his primary personal milestone being the birth of his first daughter in August. He resumed musical output in 2021, previewing his fifth studio album * = * (\"Equals\") with the single \"Bad Habits\" on 25 June, followed by \"Shivers\" on 10 September. The 14-track solo album, released on 29 October 2021 through Asylum and Atlantic Records, debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart—his fifth consecutive studio album to do so—and topped charts in over 50 countries, accumulating 689,000 combined UK sales by mid-2022, making it the year's biggest-selling album up to that point.  \n\nIn 2022, Sheeran extended * = *'s reach through remixes and additional collaborations, including a version of \"Bad Habits\" with Bring Me the Horizon performed at the BRIT Awards, where he won Songwriter of the Year, and a remix of \"2step\" featuring Lil Baby, which peaked at number eight on the UK Singles Chart.  He launched the Mathematics Tour in June 2022, supporting * = * with stadium performances across Europe and North America, while also contributing to tracks like a remix with Taylor Swift and Burna Boy alignments in promotional efforts. \n\n### 2023–2024: Reflection with - (\"Subtract\") and Autumn Variations\n\nIn early 2023, Sheeran announced the release of his sixth studio album, *−* (pronounced \"Subtract\"), on May 5, 2023, marking the conclusion of his mathematical symbol-themed album series. The album's creation was shaped by a series of personal crises beginning in 2022, including the death of his close friend Jamal Edwards in February, his wife Cherry Seaborn's diagnosis with a tumor during her pregnancy in March, and ongoing legal battles over alleged copyright infringement in songs like \"Thinking Out Loud.\" These events prompted Sheeran to confront themes of grief, depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation, leading to a raw, acoustic sound stripped of electronic production. Co-produced with Aaron Dessner of The National, the record was assembled from pre-existing demos recorded live in the studio without overdubs, emphasizing unpolished singer-songwriter intimacy over the pop polish of prior works.\n\n*−* debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart and the Billboard 200, selling over 14,000 copies in its first week in the UK alone, with lead single \"Eyes Closed\" released in January 2023 topping charts in several countries including Australia and the Netherlands. Critics noted its emotional depth but divided on its execution, praising tracks like \"Salt Water\" for vulnerability while critiquing formulaic elements in others. To promote it, Sheeran launched the − Tour in May 2023, an intimate theater run comprising 29 shows across North America, featuring full acoustic performances of the album in smaller venues like Ruth Eckerd Hall in Clearwater, Florida, contrasting his stadium-scale Mathematics Tour.\n\nFollowing *−*, Sheeran surprise-released his seventh studio album, *Autumn Variations*, on September 29, 2023, via his Gingerbread Man Records imprint, just four months after the prior record. Produced entirely by Aaron Dessner (with one exception), the 14-track set drew inspiration from seasonal introspection and personal relationships, recorded in a collaborative, organic process akin to *−* but with a folk-infused warmth evoking autumnal themes. It peaked at number four on the Billboard 200 and featured singles like \"American Town,\" reflecting on life's transitions amid Sheeran's ongoing recovery from 2022's traumas. Reception was mixed, with some outlets lauding its honesty and others dismissing it as overly sentimental and lacking innovation. Sheeran incorporated songs from *Autumn Variations* into his extended +−=÷× Tour sets through 2024, blending them with *−* material to showcase this reflective phase before shifting to new projects.\n\n### 2025–present: Play and ongoing tours\n\nIn September 2025, Sheeran released his eighth studio album, *Play*, through Gingerbread Man Records and Atlantic Records, marking a departure from the introspective tone of his prior release *Subtract* (2023) toward a lighter, more playful collection influenced by Indian and Persian musical elements. The album, comprising 13 tracks with a runtime of approximately 44 minutes, was promoted with merchandise such as pink hoodies and deluxe editions, and featured revamped remixes for select songs released in October 2025. Sheeran described *Play* as initiating a new creative phase following the completion of his mathematical-themed album series (+, −, =, ÷, ×).\n\nConcurrent with *Play*'s launch, Sheeran announced the LOOP Tour, a global outing supporting the album, featuring a new stage design and setlist incorporating material from the record alongside prior hits. The tour commenced on December 1, 2025, at Zenith in Paris, France, followed by dates including Munich on December 3, Coventry on December 5, Manchester on December 7, and Dublin on December 9, with further European, UK, Australian, and North American legs extending into 2026, including stadium shows at venues like SoFi Stadium and MetLife Stadium. This followed the wind-down of his +−=÷× Tour (also known as the Mathematics Tour), which included a historic performance in Bhutan in early 2025 and concluded in September 2025 in Düsseldorf, Germany, after spanning over 100 dates since 2022.\n\nAs of October 2025, ticket sales for the LOOP Tour's initial European dates were brisk, reflecting sustained demand for Sheeran's live performances, which emphasize acoustic loops, high-energy crowd interaction, and marathon set lengths often exceeding two hours. The tour's structure prioritizes stadium and arena formats, building on Sheeran's established format of minimal production to focus on vocal and guitar-driven delivery.\n\n## Musical style and influences\n\n### Core elements and evolution\n\nEd Sheeran's core musical style centers on acoustic-driven pop and folk, infused with hip-hop rhythms and R\\u0026B melodic phrasing, emphasizing simplicity in structure through basic guitar chord progressions and layered vocal harmonies.  His songwriting prioritizes relatable, narrative-driven lyrics rooted in autobiographical themes such as love, loss, and everyday struggles, delivered with a conversational tone that prioritizes emotional directness over complex orchestration. This approach often manifests in verse-chorus forms with hook-oriented melodies designed for broad accessibility, as evidenced by the commercial success of tracks like \"Shape of You,\" which blend tropical house beats with his signature rhythmic delivery.\n\nA hallmark of his performances is the use of a Boss RC-20 loop pedal (later upgraded models), allowing real-time building of multi-instrumental tracks from solo guitar and vocal inputs, which underscores his self-reliant, troubadour-like ethos originating from busking days. This technique preserves an organic, unpolished feel even in stadium settings, contrasting with heavily produced studio counterparts while highlighting technical proficiency in fingerpicking and beatboxing elements.\n\nThe evolution of Sheeran's style traces from raw, minimalist acoustic folk in his 2004–2010 independent releases, where tracks relied almost exclusively on guitar-vocal loops and hip-hop cadences inspired by Eminem and early mixtapes, to broader genre experimentation post-2011 breakthrough.  By the × (2014) era, productions incorporated electronic drums, synths, and dance influences for radio appeal, expanding into R\\u0026B and pop-rock hybrids, yet retaining core lyrical intimacy. Subsequent albums like ÷ (2017) and = (2021) further diversified with global fusions—such as Afrobeats in \"Bamba\" collaborations and orchestral ballads—reflecting a \"pick-and-mix\" adaptability driven by prolific writing habits, where daily composition yields refined, genre-agnostic outputs.  Recent works, including Autumn Variations (2023), revert toward stripped-back acoustic introspection amid personal challenges, demonstrating cyclical refinement rather than linear departure from foundational singer-songwriter principles.\n\n### Key influences and collaborations\n\nSheeran's early musical development drew heavily from singer-songwriters and folk traditions, with Damien Rice emerging as a transformative figure; at age 11 in 2002, Sheeran attended a Rice performance of \"Cannonball,\" which he later described as life-changing, inspiring his loop pedal technique and solo performance style. Van Morrison's influence stemmed from familial exposure, as Sheeran's parents favored the Northern Irish artist's work, contributing to his appreciation for soulful, narrative-driven folk-blues. Eric Clapton and Derek and the Dominos shaped his guitar playing; Sheeran pinpointed Clapton's \"Layla\" (1970) as the trigger for learning acoustic guitar at age 11, emulating its unplugged rendition. Hip-hop elements entered via Eminem's \"Stan\" (2000), which Sheeran credited for introducing storytelling through rhyme, blending rap's cadence with his folk roots.\n\nCollaborations have amplified Sheeran's pop-folk hybrid, often bridging genres. His 2017 track \"Perfect Duet\" with Andrea Bocelli reimagined his ballad in operatic style, peaking at No. 21 on the Billboard Hot 100. With Taylor Swift, \"Everything Has Changed\" (2012) from her Red album marked an early crossover hit, reaching No. 57 on the Hot 100 and showcasing acoustic synergy. The 2019 No.6 Collaborations Project featured 22 artists, including Justin Bieber on \"I Don't Care\" (No. 2 Hot 100) and Khalid on \"Beautiful People\" (No. 5), emphasizing eclectic pairings from pop to rap. Later efforts included \"2step\" remix with Lil Baby (2022), integrating trap beats, and \"Bad Habits\" with Bring Me the Horizon, fusing electronic pop with metalcore. These partnerships, totaling over 50 credited features by 2023, reflect Sheeran's strategy of genre-blending without diluting his core songwriting.\n\n## Business ventures\n\n### Gingerbread Man Records\n\nGingerbread Man Records is a British independent record label established by singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran in partnership with Warner Music Group. The label was incorporated on 30 March 2015 as Gingerbread Man Records Limited, with Sheeran announcing its formation earlier that month to support emerging artists he admired, functioning as a vanity imprint for targeted releases rather than a full-scale operation. Distributed through Warner Music UK, it allows Sheeran to curate and promote talent while retaining creative control, reflecting his stated intent to \"give back\" by signing acts from his early career network without the constraints of major-label bureaucracy.\n\nThe label's inaugural signing was Irish singer-songwriter Jamie Lawson, whose self-titled debut album was released on 9 October 2015, marking the imprint's launch and achieving moderate commercial success, including a UK Albums Chart peak at number 11. Subsequent signings included Northern Irish artist Foy Vance, whose album *The Wild Swan* followed in 2016, benefiting from Sheeran's promotional support during his own tours. In June 2021, British singer-songwriter Maisie Peters joined the roster, releasing her debut single \"Psycho\" (co-written with Sheeran) on 2 July 2021 and her album *You Signed Up for This* later that year, which entered the UK Albums Chart at number 7.\n\nSheeran has also utilized the label for select personal projects, including his 2025 album *Play*, released under Gingerbread Man Records and Atlantic Records UK, emphasizing independent distribution flexibility within his Warner deal. The imprint maintains a low-profile roster focused on singer-songwriters, prioritizing artistic development over mass-market volume, with ongoing activity evidenced by its official YouTube channel launched in August 2015 for artist content.\n\n### Bertie Blossoms management\n\nIn 2019, Ed Sheeran co-founded Bertie Blossoms, a two-story bar and restaurant located at 83 Portobello Road in London's Notting Hill district, in partnership with his long-time manager Stuart Camp. The venue, redeveloped from the former Spanish restaurant Galicia which closed in 2018, was acquired for an estimated £1.5 million and operates under companies including That Dive Bar Portobello Limited. Its name derives from the partners' girlfriends at the time—Liberty \"Bertie\" Shaw (Camp's partner) and Cherry Seaborn (Sheeran's wife, evoking cherry blossoms)—reflecting a personal touch in the business naming.\n\nBertie Blossoms functions as a gastro pub specializing in tapas-inspired dishes that fuse Spanish influences with British comfort food, alongside an extensive cocktail and drinks menu in a low-lit, vibrant setting. Sheeran and Camp oversee its operations through direct involvement, with Sheeran assuming directorial roles in the operating entities by June 2021 to consolidate control over his broader pub and property holdings valued at approximately £26 million at the time. Early management included Alex Hughes as on-site manager, who departed in April 2020 amid operational adjustments.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Sheeran opted not to place Bertie Blossoms staff on government furlough, instead covering full wages for waiters, bar staff, chefs, and kitchen assistants to maintain employment stability. Sheeran later acknowledged a \"rocky start\" for the venue amid lockdowns, but it has continued operations, emphasizing neighborhood dining with global culinary elements. The business represents one facet of Sheeran's diversification beyond music, leveraging his personal network for hands-on oversight rather than delegating to external firms.\n\n## Other professional activities\n\n### Acting roles\n\nSheeran made his professional acting debut in the 2007 British musical drama series *Britannia High*, where he appeared as a contestant auditioning for a fictional boyband, performing a dance routine before being rejected by a judge. In 2014, he guest-starred in an episode of the New Zealand soap opera *Shortland Street*, portraying a character who provides an impromptu guitar lesson to a teenager. The following year, he played Teddy, a figure from a character's past, in the Australian soap *Home and Away*.\n\nOne of his more extended television roles came in 2015 as Sir Cormac, an ambitious protégé knight, appearing in five episodes of the FX historical series *The Bastard Executioner*. Sheeran received particular attention for his 2017 cameo in the HBO fantasy series *Game of Thrones*, where he portrayed Eddie, a Lannister soldier sharing a campfire scene and original song with Arya Stark (played by Maisie Williams); the appearance was arranged by showrunners as a surprise for Williams, a fan of his work. In 2018, he provided voice acting as Brendan Beiderbecke, a musician character, in the *Simpsons* episode \"Haw-Haw Land.\" His sole credited dramatic television role to date is as Mick, a homeless individual taken in by a couple, in the 2019 Amazon Prime anthology series *Modern Love* (season 1, episode 7).\n\nSheeran's film roles have largely been brief cameos, often as himself or uncredited parts. In *Bridget Jones's Baby* (2016), he appeared in a bar scene mistaken by the protagonist for a barista. He played himself in the 2019 romantic comedy *Yesterday*, advising the lead character on songwriting, and had an uncredited role as a stormtrooper (also appearing briefly as an alien resistance member) in *Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker* that same year. Additional film cameos include himself in the 2021 Netflix action film *Red Notice* and an appearance in the 2023 comedy *Sumotherhood*. In 2025, he provided the voice for Ed Shearin, a sheep character, in the animated film *Zootopia 2*. These roles reflect Sheeran's occasional forays into acting, typically leveraging his celebrity status rather than pursuing it as a primary career.\n### Charity initiatives and philanthropy\n\nEd Sheeran has engaged in philanthropy primarily focused on children's health, local community support in Suffolk, England, and music education initiatives. During the COVID-19 pandemic, he donated over £1 million to charities in his hometown area, including funding for a children's hospital ward.\n\nA key beneficiary of his efforts has been East Anglia's Children's Hospices (EACH), where Sheeran serves as an ambassador. In January 2024, an auction of clothing and accessories donated by Sheeran raised nearly £30,000 for the organization, which provides care for children with life-threatening conditions in Cambridgeshire, Essex, Norfolk, and Suffolk. He has repeatedly contributed items such as worn garments, jewelry, and instruments; for instance, in July 2013, he signed a guitar to support hospice fundraising. Additional donations in 2025, including boxer shorts, bongo drums, jeans, and jewelry, continued to generate funds through EACH shops and online sales.\n\nIn January 2025, Sheeran established the Ed Sheeran Foundation to promote music education among children in the United Kingdom, emphasizing skills in playing instruments, production, songwriting, and performance. The foundation provides grants to schools, projects, and community groups.\n\nOther notable contributions include selling splatter paintings in August 2025, which raised more than $1 million for unspecified charities, and a $10,000 donation in September 2017 to the Jim Pattison Children's Hospital Foundation in Saskatchewan, Canada. Sheeran has also supported broader causes such as AIDS/HIV awareness, at-risk youth programs, and cancer research through endorsements and event participation. In April 2017, he visited Liberia to highlight street children issues for Comic Relief's Red Nose Day campaign.\n\n## Personal life\n\n### Relationships and family\n\nEd Sheeran was born to John Sheeran, an art curator, exhibition organizer, lecturer, editor, and publisher, and Imogen Sheeran, a former cultural publicist and jewellery designer. He has an older brother, Matthew Sheeran, who works as a composer, orchestrator, and arranger.\n\nIn his early career, Sheeran dated Scottish singer-songwriter Nina Nesbitt from 2012 to 2013; their relationship inspired songs such as \"Nina\" and \"Photograph.\" He later dated Athina Andrelos, a Greek tour promoter, from 2014 to 2015, which influenced tracks like \"Don't\" from his album *X*.\n\nSheeran began a relationship with Cherry Seaborn, a childhood acquaintance from Thomas Mills High School in Suffolk, in July 2015 after reconnecting at a party hosted by singer Ed Sheeran. The couple became engaged in December 2017 and married privately in January 2019 at Framlingham Castle in Suffolk, with a small guest list including close family and friends. Seaborn, a former Duke University field hockey player, works in public relations and has largely stayed out of the public eye.\n\nSheeran and Seaborn have two daughters: Lyra Antarctica Seaborn Sheeran, born in August 2020, and Jupiter Seaborn Sheeran, born in May 2022. The couple announced the births via Instagram, with Sheeran expressing a desire to prioritize family privacy amid his career demands.\n\n### Health challenges and lifestyle\n\nSheeran has spoken publicly about his struggles with alcohol consumption, describing periods of excessive drinking, including up to ten pints per night during tours and daily habits in earlier years. Following the death of his friend Jamal Edwards in February 2022 and amid family pressures, he quit hard liquor and drugs, attributing the decision to a wake-up call from his wife's pregnancy and his own addictive tendencies. By April 2025, he reported having altered his relationship with alcohol but clarified he does not intend permanent sobriety, having ceased pints after candid discussions with his wife.\n\nHe has also detailed challenges with eating behaviors, including binge eating to the point of illness and self-described bulimia-like episodes tied to his \"very addictive personality,\" particularly during the early phases of his career success around 2010-2015. These issues compounded body image insecurities, where he felt embarrassed about his habits and appearance.\n\nMental health difficulties emerged prominently after Edwards' death and his wife Cherry Seaborn's tumor diagnosis in 2021 while six months pregnant with their second child, leading to depression, feelings of parental shame, and anxiety including panic attacks. Sheeran sought therapy to address these, noting in 2023 interviews that the losses and health scares triggered a downward spiral he actively confronted.\n\nIn response, Sheeran adopted lifestyle modifications emphasizing sobriety from harder substances, reduced alcohol intake, and cessation of smoking. By 2025, he undertook a fitness regimen including daily exercise such as running, swimming, sit-ups, and Pilates, alongside dietary shifts away from daily takeaways and beer, resulting in a 14-pound weight loss and self-described \"best shape of my life.\" He expressed goals for visible abdominal definition, framing these changes as sustainable habits rather than temporary fixes, though acknowledging occasional setbacks.\n\n### Relocation to the United States\n\nIn September 2025, Ed Sheeran announced his intention to relocate temporarily to the United States with his wife, Cherry Seaborn, and their daughters for the duration of his upcoming tour. On the September 7 episode of *The 2 Johnnies Podcast*, he stated, \"I'm just about to move to America,\" explaining that the decision stemmed from the logistics of extended touring, as he preferred not to commute frequently from London to U.S. venues like San Diego.\n\nSheeran highlighted Nashville as his preferred U.S. destination, calling it his favorite American city and a longstanding aspiration for shifting toward country music production. This aligns with his prior U.S. real estate investments, including a 2013 purchase of a house in Hendersonville near Nashville to facilitate songwriting away from paparazzi scrutiny. In July 2025, he acquired a £9 million apartment in Brooklyn Heights, New York, adding to his overseas holdings after initially renting the property for two years.\n\nFollowing viral media coverage framing the move as a permanent exit from the UK, Sheeran clarified on September 10 via Instagram that it was not a full relocation or tax-driven decision, but rather a family-based adjustment to the tour schedule: \"I'm not moving, I'm going on tour with my family and relocating to the continent I'm touring on.\" He affirmed plans to return to the UK afterward, retaining ownership of his Suffolk estate and other domestic properties. This temporary arrangement underscores practical touring needs over long-term emigration, despite Sheeran's expressed fondness for American music scenes.\n\n## Controversies and legal issues\n\n### Plagiarism lawsuits and intellectual property disputes\n\nIn 2016, Ed Sheeran and co-writer Johnny McDaid settled a copyright infringement claim brought by songwriters Martin Harrington and Thomas Leonard, who alleged that Sheeran's 2014 single \"Photograph\" copied elements from their 2011 composition \"Amazing,\" originally performed by Matt Cardle; the settlement amounted to approximately £16 million (around $20 million USD at the time).\n\nSheeran faced another high-profile lawsuit in 2018 when British grime artist Sami Chokri (performing as Sami Switch) and co-writer Ross O'Donoghue accused him of infringing their 2015 track \"Oh Why\" in the 2017 hit \"Shape of You,\" specifically claiming subconscious copying of the phrase \"Oh-I-oh-I\" hook and related musical elements; royalties from the song, which has exceeded 5 billion streams, were temporarily suspended pending resolution. On April 6, 2022, the UK High Court ruled in Sheeran's favor, with Justice Antony Zacaroli determining that no deliberate or subconscious copying occurred, as the shared elements were commonplace in popular music and Sheeran had no access to \"Oh Why\" prior to writing his song. In June 2022, Sheeran was awarded over £900,000 in legal costs from Chokri. Following the verdict, Sheeran publicly criticized such claims as \"really, really scary,\" arguing they undermine songwriters by implying basic chord progressions and phrases are proprietary.\n\nThe most protracted dispute involved Sheeran's 2014 song \"Thinking Out Loud,\" sued in 2016 by the heirs of Ed Townsend, co-writer of Marvin Gaye's 1973 hit \"Let's Get It On,\" who contended that Sheeran copied the chord progression, bass line, rhythm, and \"groove\" despite Sheeran's testimony of only passing familiarity with Gaye's track; the case highlighted tensions between protecting original expressions and common musical tropes like the I-III-IV-V progression in 6/8 time. A Manhattan federal jury acquitted Sheeran on May 4, 2023, after a trial where he demonstrated live that the shared elements were \"fundamental musical building blocks\" ubiquitous in soul and pop genres, not unique to Gaye's composition. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the ruling on November 1, 2024, rejecting arguments that the verdict ignored broader \"combination\" claims, and the U.S. Supreme Court denied certiorari on June 16, 2025, ending the litigation. Sheeran described the suits as exhausting, stating post-verdict that ongoing accusations risk paralyzing creativity by treating generic ideas as copyrightable.\n\n### Public feuds and media criticisms\n\nEd Sheeran has faced recurring media criticisms for his music's perceived simplicity and ubiquity, with outlets and online communities often describing his work as formulaic or lacking artistic depth. For instance, a 2018 Vice article characterized him as the \"world's biggest pop star, and he sucks,\" highlighting backlash over his Grammy wins and dominance in pop radio. Similarly, discussions on platforms like Reddit's r/popheads in 2021 attributed dislike to his appeal to a \"basic heteronormative audience,\" framing his success as culturally unadventurous rather than innovative. These views reflect a broader tension in music journalism, where commercial triumphs are sometimes dismissed by critics favoring niche or experimental styles, despite Sheeran's albums consistently achieving high streaming numbers—such as *Divide* (2017) surpassing 10 billion Spotify streams by 2020.\n\nIn response, Sheeran has publicly challenged the relevance of music critics, arguing that streaming platforms empower audiences to judge directly via data, rendering traditional reviews obsolete. During a March 2023 Rolling Stone UK interview promoting his album *Subtract*, he stated, \"Why do you need to read a review? Listen to it,\" dismissing critics as disconnected from modern consumption where over 100,000 tracks upload daily to Spotify. This stance provoked rebuttals from media figures, with NME and The Big Issue defending criticism's role in navigating overload and countering industry hype, accusing Sheeran of underestimating guidance for listeners amid algorithmic biases. Sheeran's position aligns with empirical listener metrics—his tracks like \"Shape of You\" holding Billboard Hot 100 records—over subjective elite tastes, though detractors contend it ignores critique's function in fostering discernment beyond popularity.\n\nA notable public feud emerged in November 2024 over Band Aid's \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\" re-release for its 40th anniversary. Sheeran denied permission for his 2014 vocals to be used, aligning with British-Ghanaian artist Fuse ODG's critique that the song perpetuates \"damaging stereotypes\" of Africa as a passive charity case, per ODG's Instagram post. Bob Geldof, co-organizer, defended the track's fundraising legacy—which raised over £100 million historically—and questioned Sheeran's withdrawal, prompting media coverage framing it as a clash between charitable intent and cultural sensitivity. Sheeran did not directly engage Geldof but supported ODG's call for artists to \"speak up,\" highlighting tensions in Western-led aid narratives amid evolving global views on representation.\n\n## Political views\n\n### Stance on UK politics and Brexit\n\nEd Sheeran has expressed a pro-European identity, stating in a 2017 interview that he was \"born a European and I fucking love being a European,\" which implied support for remaining in the European Union during the 2016 referendum, though he did not explicitly disclose his vote. He has criticized aspects of Brexit's implementation, particularly its effects on the music industry, signing an open letter in October 2018 warning Prime Minister Theresa May that a \"botched Brexit\" would damage creative sectors by complicating cross-border touring and performances. In January 2021, alongside artists including Elton John and Sting, Sheeran co-signed another letter to the government decrying the post-Brexit trade deal as having \"shamefully failed\" British musicians by ending visa-free movement within the EU, thereby increasing costs and logistical barriers for touring. \n\nRegarding broader UK politics, Sheeran has described himself as generally uninvolved, stating in 2017 that he does not \"get involved in politics\" despite public perceptions labeling him a Conservative supporter, which he rejected. He has voiced admiration for Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, calling himself a \"big Corbyn fan\" in July 2017 and later praising Corbyn in December 2017 for \"car[ing] about other people\" and embodying values he supports, though he emphasized he is \"not Mr Political\" and avoided explicit party endorsement.  In March 2025, Sheeran authored an open letter to Prime Minister Keir Starmer and government officials, urging an immediate £250 million investment in music education to hire 1,000 additional teachers and sustain programs, signed by over 100 artists including Harry Styles and Elton John; this initiative focused on policy rather than partisan alignment. \n\n### Views on social issues and international aid\n\nSheeran has expressed concerns about urban crime and safety in the United Kingdom, particularly in London. In a July 2024 interview on the Theo Von podcast, he described every area of the city as \"sketchy,\" noting that even affluent neighborhoods face risks from muggings and violence, while poorer areas are similarly unsafe, reflecting broader failures in public safety amid rising street crime.\n\nIn January 2024, Sheeran signed an open letter alongside artists including Liam Gallagher, urging UK politicians to prioritize addressing poverty through policy reforms, emphasizing the need for systemic action on economic inequality.\n\nRegarding abortion, Sheeran distanced himself from pro-life advocacy in May 2018 ahead of Ireland's referendum repealing the Eighth Amendment. He stated that anti-abortion campaigners' use of his song \"Small Bump\"—which recounts a personal miscarriage experience—did not reflect the track's intent, and he had not authorized its promotion in that context.\n\nSheeran has faced calls for bans in conservative regions over perceived support for LGBTQ+ rights, including a February 2024 demand from Malaysia's opposition leader to prohibit his concert there due to his advocacy for the community, though specific statements from Sheeran remain limited to broader inclusivity in his public persona.\n\nOn international aid, Sheeran has critiqued Western celebrity-driven efforts for fostering dependency and stereotypes. In November 2024, he publicly opposed the unauthorized inclusion of his 2014 vocals in the 40th-anniversary re-release of Band Aid's \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\" and affirmed he would have declined participation, citing recognition of the \"harm initiatives like it inflict on Africa\" by portraying the continent as perpetually needy and disempowering local agency. He endorsed Ghanaian-British artist Fuse ODG's parallel statement condemning the song for \"dehumanising Africans\" through savior narratives that overlook African progress and self-determination. This stance echoes his 2014 refusal to join Band Aid 30 for analogous reasons, favoring approaches that promote autonomy over performative charity.\n\n## Cultural impact and reception\n\n### Commercial success and industry influence\n\nEd Sheeran's commercial achievements include massive album sales, streaming records, and tour revenues that rank among the highest in music history. His debut three studio albums—*+*, *x*, and *÷*—collectively sold 22 million pure units globally, averaging 7.4 million per album. In the United States, he ranks as the 15th best-selling digital singles artist with certified sales exceeding 103 million units, per Recording Industry Association of America data. His 2025 release *Play* debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart, marking his ninth chart-topping album there with 67,654 equivalent units in its first week, including strong physical sales across CDs, vinyl, and cassettes.\n\nStreaming has amplified his reach, with Sheeran accumulating over 60 billion plays as lead artist on Spotify as of October 2025. Tracks like \"Shape of You\" from *÷* hold records for prolonged chart dominance, spending extended weeks in Billboard Hot 100's top tiers, while \"Perfect\" surpassed 3.5 billion Spotify streams, contributing to his Guinness World Record recognition for streaming milestones. Live performances underscore his earning power: the ÷ Tour (2017–2019) grossed $775 million across 255 dates, setting a benchmark for solo artist tours at the time. The subsequent +–=÷× Tour (Mathematics Tour, 2022–2025) exceeded $875 million in ticket sales over 188 shows, further solidifying his position among top-grossing acts.\n\nSheeran's industry influence extends through songwriting credits for other major artists, shaping pop and contemporary hits. He co-wrote One Direction's \"Little Things\" (2012), which topped the UK Singles Chart, and Rudimental's \"Lay It All on Me\" featuring his vocals. Additional contributions include tracks for Justin Bieber, Taylor Swift, and Hoodie Allen, with over 30 documented songs demonstrating his melodic and lyrical craftsmanship adopted across genres. This behind-the-scenes role has earned him credits on multi-platinum releases, influencing production trends toward acoustic-pop hybrids and loop-pedal innovation in live settings. His net worth, estimated at $350 million in 2025, reflects diversified revenue from music, endorsements, and investments, positioning him as one of the UK's wealthiest musicians under 40.\n\n### Critical assessments and public perception\n\nEd Sheeran's albums have consistently received mixed reviews from critics, who often commend his melodic craftsmanship and emotional delivery while faulting his output for formulaic structures and commercial predictability. His debut album *+* (2011) earned generally favorable notices for its raw acoustic folk elements, achieving a Metacritic aggregate score reflecting positive consensus among reviewers. Subsequent releases like *×* (2014) and *÷* (2017) maintained this pattern, with praise for hit singles such as \"Thinking Out Loud\" tempered by critiques of over-reliance on pop tropes and loop pedal performances.\n\nLater works faced increasing scrutiny for perceived lack of innovation; the 2021 album *=* drew divided responses, with some outlets appreciating its intimacy amid the COVID-19 pandemic but others dismissing it as sanitized balladry lacking edge. His 2025 release *Play* scored 61 on Metacritic, typifying detractors' views as \"sweetly generic\" and \"uninspired,\" with accusations of automated lyricism sparking AI involvement rumors despite denials. Pitchfork rated it 4.3 out of 10, highlighting half-hearted genre experiments, while The Arts Desk called it \"lowest common denominator\" despite polished production. Sheeran countered such evaluations in 2023, stating music critics serve no purpose in the streaming age where audiences directly sample content.\n\nPublic perception diverges markedly from critical consensus, with Sheeran enjoying widespread popularity as an \"everyman\" figure whose relatable lyrics resonate with mainstream audiences. A YouGov survey found 55% favorable views, 24% neutral, and only 10% dislike, underscoring his appeal despite overexposure complaints. Fans value his grounded persona and songwriting accessibility, driving record-breaking streams and sales that affirm commercial validation over elite approbation. Detractors, often citing averageness in vocals and arrangements, represent a vocal minority amid his dominance as the decade's most-streamed artist. This critic-public schism highlights Sheeran's formula's efficacy in capturing broad sentiment, prioritizing emotional directness over avant-garde experimentation.\n\n## Accolades\n\n### Major awards and nominations\n\nEd Sheeran has received four Grammy Awards from 17 nominations, primarily recognizing his songwriting and pop albums. His wins include Song of the Year for \"Thinking Out Loud\" at the 58th Annual Grammy Awards on February 15, 2016. He also secured Best Pop Solo Performance for \"Shape of You\" and Best Pop Vocal Album for *÷* at the 60th Annual Grammy Awards in 2018. Nominations have spanned categories such as Album of the Year for *÷* in 2018 and Best Pop Vocal Album for *-* in 2024, reflecting consistent industry acknowledgment of his commercial output.\n\n| Year | Category | Work | Result |\n|------|----------|------|--------|\n| 2016 | Song of the Year | \"Thinking Out Loud\" | Won |\n| 2018 | Best Pop Solo Performance | \"Shape of the You\" | Won |\n| 2018 | Best Pop Vocal Album | *÷* | Won |\n\nAt the Brit Awards, Sheeran has won seven honors from over 20 nominations, establishing him as a dominant figure in British music accolades. Early successes include British Breakthrough Act and British Male Solo Artist in 2012, followed by British Album of the Year for *x* in 2015 and British Male Solo Artist that same year. He received the Brit Awards Global Success Award in 2018 for international impact. Recent nominations include British Single for collaborations like \"Bloodstream\" in 2016.\n\nThe Ivor Novello Awards, focused on songwriting excellence, have recognized Sheeran multiple times for lyrical and musical craftsmanship. \"The A Team\" won Best Song Musically and Lyrically in 2012, while he earned Songwriter of the Year in 2015 and again in 2018 for works including *÷*. These prizes underscore his compositional strengths beyond performance metrics.\n\nSheeran has also garnered wins at the Billboard Music Awards, including Top Artist in 2018, and MTV Video Music Awards, such as Best Pop Video for \"Shape of You\" in 2017. In 2025, he received MTV VMA nominations for Best Pop and Best Cinematography for \"Sapphire.\" His tally exceeds 300 nominations across ceremonies, with strengths in pop and songwriter categories reflecting sales-driven validation rather than unanimous critical consensus.\n\n### Record-breaking achievements\n\nEd Sheeran holds 16 Guinness World Records titles related to his music career as of May 2023, encompassing achievements in chart performance, streaming, and sales.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, Sheeran achieved the record for the most simultaneous entries in the Top 20 of the Official Singles Chart with 16 tracks on 10 March 2017, led by \"Shape of You\" at No. 1 and including \"Galway Girl\" at No. 2. He was the first artist to debut two singles simultaneously in the UK Top 10, with \"Shape of You\" at No. 1 and \"Castle on the Hill\" at No. 2 on the chart dated 19 January 2017. Additionally, his single \"Thinking Out Loud\" set the record for the longest climb to No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart, taking 19 weeks from its initial entry in June 2014.\n\nSheeran's ÷ (Divide) album, released on 3 March 2017, established multiple streaming benchmarks, including the highest first-week streams on Spotify globally with nearly 375 million plays. The lead single \"Shape of You\" broke the Spotify record for most streams in 24 hours upon its premiere on 6 January 2017. By February 2023, ÷ had become the most-streamed album on Spotify with 12.835 billion plays. In the UK, \"Shape of You\" accumulated 6.291 million streams, marking it as the biggest streaming single of the Official Chart's streaming era through July 2024.\n\nOn the sales front, Sheeran's debut album + (Plus), released in 2011, holds the Guinness record for the fastest-selling pop album in the UK by a male artist, with first-week sales comprising 62% physical copies, 26% downloads, and 12% streaming equivalents.\n\nSheeran's live performances have set venue-specific attendance records, including 72,102 at U.S. Bank Stadium on 14 August 2023, the highest for any concert at that venue; 73,874 at Nissan Stadium on 22 July 2023, surpassing prior marks; and over 80,000 at SoFi Stadium in September 2023. His ÷ Tour amassed 8.1 million attendees by August 2019, contributing to its recognition as the highest-attendance music tour at that point per Guinness metrics, though later tours have expanded totals.\n\n## Works\n\n### Discography\n\nEd Sheeran's discography consists of studio albums primarily released via Asylum Records and its parent labels, achieving consistent commercial dominance on global charts. His early independent releases were extended plays (EPs), starting with *The Orange Room* in 2005 at age 14, which garnered limited distribution without charting on major albums lists. These preceded his major-label transition, yielding albums that collectively account for tens of millions in sales; the first three studio albums alone generated 22 million units worldwide.\n\nThe following table summarizes his main studio albums, including release dates and UK chart peaks as tracked by the Official Charts Company. All have debuted at number one in the UK, reflecting sustained market performance.\n\n| Album                  | Release date       | UK peak |\n|------------------------|--------------------|---------|\n| + (Plus)              | 12 September 2011 | 1       |\n| × (Multiply)          | 23 June 2014      | 1       |\n| ÷ (Divide)            | 3 March 2017      | 1       |\n| = (Equals)            | 29 October 2021   | 1       |\n| − (Subtract)          | 5 May 2023        | 1       |\n| Autumn Variations     | 29 September 2023 | 1       |\n| Play                  | 12 September 2025 | 1       |\n\nSheeran has also issued compilation albums, such as *+–=÷× (Tour Collection)*, which reached number one on the UK Albums Chart in January 2025. *Play*, his most recent studio release as of October 2025, earned a silver certification in the UK for over 60,000 units shortly after launch.\n\nKey EPs include *No. 5 Collaborations Project* (2011), featuring guest artists that boosted his early visibility, and later efforts like *5* (2017), a collaborative mini-album. His singles output exceeds 60 as lead artist, with 14 reaching number one on the UK Singles Chart and 41 top-ten entries overall. Standout tracks include \"Shape of You\" from *÷*, which topped the US Billboard Hot 100 for 12 non-consecutive weeks and received 8× Platinum certification from the RIAA. \"The A Team,\" his 2011 breakthrough, peaked at number three in the UK. Many singles have driven album sales through streaming equivalents, contributing to certifications like 3× Platinum for *+* in the UK by 2022.\n\n### Filmography and television appearances\n\nSheeran made his screen acting debut in 2007, appearing as a student in the British musical drama television series *Britannia High*, an early role before his music career gained prominence.\n\nIn 2014, he featured in a cameo as himself on the New Zealand soap opera *Shortland Street*, performing during a promotional visit to the country. That same year, Sheeran hosted *Saturday Night Live*, where he both performed music and participated in sketches, marking one of his initial high-profile U.S. television engagements.\n\nSubsequent appearances included guest spots as himself on Australian soap *Home and Away* in 2015 and the U.S. sitcom *Undateable* later that year. Also in 2015, he portrayed the knight Sir Cormac in the historical drama series *The Bastard Executioner*.\n\nSheeran's film cameos began with *Bridget Jones's Baby* (2016), where he played himself performing \"Perfect\" at a wedding scene, and *Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping* (2016), a mockumentary satire featuring him as a collaborator with the lead character. In 2017, he appeared as the Lannister soldier Eddie in *Game of Thrones* season 7, episode 1, singing a folk song around a campfire with other recruits.\n\nFurther television roles encompassed Brendan Beiderbecke in *The Simpsons* (2018), a character aiding the protagonist's songwriting, and Mick, a busker, in the Amazon anthology *Modern Love* (2019). In films, he cameo-ed as himself in *Yesterday* (2019), interacting with the lead in a music-themed narrative, and provided an uncredited Stormtrooper voice in *Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker* (2019).\n\nHis most recent notable appearance was a cameo as himself in the action-comedy *Red Notice* (2021), sharing a scene with Dwayne Johnson during a museum heist sequence. Sheeran has primarily limited his acting to brief, often self-referential cameos tied to his musical persona, avoiding lead roles.\n\n| Year | Title | Role | Medium |\n|------|--------|------|--------|\n| 2007 | *Britannia High* | Student | Television |\n| 2014 | *Shortland Street* | Himself | Television |\n| 2015 | *Home and Away* | Himself | Television |\n| 2015 | *Undateable* | Himself | Television |\n| 2015 | *The Bastard Executioner* | Sir Cormac | Television |\n| 2016 | *Bridget Jones's Baby* | Himself | Film |\n| 2016 | *Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping* | Himself | Film |\n| 2017 | *Game of Thrones* | Eddie | Television |\n| 2018 | *The Simpsons* | Brendan Beiderbecke | Television |\n| 2019 | *Modern Love* | Mick | Television |\n| 2019 | *Yesterday* | Himself | Film |\n| 2019 | *Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker* | Stormtrooper (voice, uncredited) | Film |\n| 2021 | *Red Notice* | Himself | Film |\n\n### Concert tours and live performances\n\nEd Sheeran's live performances evolved from busking and small club gigs in his early career to large-scale stadium tours, often featuring his signature use of a loop pedal to layer guitar, vocals, and percussion solo on stage. His professional touring began with the + Tour (2011–2013), supporting his debut album +, which included arena shows across Europe and North America, building his reputation for energetic, self-accompanied sets.\n\nThe x Tour (2014–2015), promoting x, commenced on August 6, 2014, in Osaka, Japan, and concluded on December 12, 2015, in Auckland, New Zealand, spanning Asia, Europe, the Americas, and Oceania with a mix of arenas and stadiums. This tour marked his transition to headline major venues, including three consecutive sold-out nights at Wembley Stadium in July 2015, drawing over 240,000 attendees across the UK leg.\n\nThe ÷ Tour (2017–2019), in support of ÷, consisted of 260 shows across six continents, starting March 16, 2017, in Turin, Italy, and ending August 26, 2019, in Ipswich, England. It grossed $776 million from 8.9 million tickets sold, setting a then-record for the highest-grossing tour by surpassing U2's 360° Tour. The tour featured innovative staging with video projections and guest appearances, such as Elton John at select dates, and included record attendances like 72,000 at U.S. Bank Stadium in 2018.\n\nThe +–=÷× Tour (Mathematics Tour; 2022–2025), encompassing material from multiple albums including = and earlier works, ran 188 shows across four continents from April 23, 2022, in Dublin, Ireland, to September 7, 2025, in Düsseldorf, Germany. It generated $875.7 million in revenue from 8.8 million tickets, making Sheeran the first solo artist with two tours each exceeding $400 million. The tour emphasized high-production stadium spectacles and concluded with three nights in Germany attracting 195,000 fans.\n\nSheeran's tours have collectively grossed over $1.7 billion from nearly 19 million tickets sold since 2012, positioning him among the highest-grossing live acts. Notable one-off performances include his TikTok Live UEFA EURO 2020 show in 2021, which drew 5.5 million viewers, and appearances at events like the Queen's Platinum Jubilee Pageant in 2022.",
