  "content": "# Travis Scott\n\nJacques Bermon Webster II (born April 30, 1991), known professionally as Travis Scott, is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, and record producer recognized for pioneering a psychedelic trap subgenre characterized by atmospheric production and auto-tuned vocals. Raised in a Houston suburb, Scott began producing music as a teenager and gained initial traction through mixtapes and production credits for artists like Kanye West in the early 2010s.  \n\nScott's breakthrough came with his 2015 debut album *Rodeo*, followed by commercial successes including *Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight* (2016) and *Astroworld* (2018), the latter certified multi-platinum with over 16 million equivalent units sold worldwide. His discography has amassed more than 70 million equivalent album sales, bolstered by hit singles such as \"Goosebumps\" featuring Kendrick Lamar, which has exceeded 3 billion streams. Scott has received ten Grammy Award nominations, a Latin Grammy, and multiple Billboard Music Awards, while his tours, including the record-breaking *Circus Maximus* in 2024-2025, rank among the highest-grossing for a solo rapper.  \n\nBeyond music, Scott has built a business empire through Cactus Jack Records, apparel lines, and high-profile collaborations with Nike on sneakers and McDonald's on meal promotions, contributing to an estimated net worth of $80 million as of 2025. His signature high-energy, mosh-pit-encouraging performances have drawn praise for innovation but also scrutiny for safety issues, culminating in the 2021 Astroworld Festival crowd crush in Houston that killed ten attendees and injured hundreds amid overcrowding and compression against barriers. Multiple lawsuits alleged negligence by Scott and organizers Live Nation, though criminal charges against him were declined. Recent legal troubles include a 2024 arrest in Paris for an altercation with a security guard at a hotel, from which he was released without charges.\n\n## Early Life\n\n### Family Background and Childhood\n\nJacques Bermon Webster II, professionally known as Travis Scott, was born on April 30, 1991, in Houston, Texas, to parents Wanda Webster and Jacques Webster Sr.. Wanda worked in corporate roles, including at AT\\u0026T, while Jacques Sr. owned a music equipment rental business and pursued musical interests himself.. The family included Webster's two younger brothers, Jordan and Joshua, and maintained ties to extended relatives involved in music, such as his grandfather, a jazz composer..\n\nFrom ages one to six, Webster primarily resided with his paternal grandmother, Sealie, in Houston's South Park neighborhood, a low-income area marked by elevated crime rates that later informed elements of his artistic themes.. At around age six, following family relocation enabled by his father's business, he moved to the middle-class suburb of Missouri City, south of Houston, where his parents raised the children in a stable household.. This shift from urban hardship to suburban normalcy exposed Webster to contrasting environments, with the former fostering early resilience amid local dangers like gang activity..\n\nWebster's childhood interests leaned toward music production, influenced by his father's sound engineering background and access to equipment, though he did not formally study instruments until later.. Family dynamics emphasized self-reliance, as Webster has described periodic stays with his grandmother shaping his independence, while parental support provided resources for creative pursuits without early professional pressure..\n\n### Education and Initial Musical Pursuits\n\nWebster attended Elkins High School in Missouri City, Texas, graduating in 2008 at the age of 17 after completing the program a year early. During this period, he participated in musical theater and began skipping classes to experiment with music production, fostering an early interest in hip-hop beats and recording. He formed a hip-hop group called The Classmates with high school friends Chris Holloway and OG Chess, marking his initial foray into collaborative music efforts.\n\nFollowing high school, Webster enrolled at the University of Texas at San Antonio but dropped out during his sophomore year around 2009–2010 to prioritize music full-time. His parents had conditioned financial support for a home studio on his continued enrollment in college, but withdrew aid upon learning of the dropout, compelling him to relocate initially to New York City for greater exposure in the music scene. At age 16, while still in high school, Webster had already begun producing hip-hop tracks, entering his first songwriting contest and uploading early work to platforms like MySpace to build a rudimentary online presence. These pursuits reflected a self-directed shift from formal education toward hands-on audio engineering and beat-making, driven by dissatisfaction with academic structure.\n\n## Musical Career\n\n### Career Beginnings and Early Deals (2008–2012)\n\nIn 2008, at age 16, Jacques Webster—later known as Travis Scott—formed the hip hop duo The Graduates with childhood friend Chris Holloway while attending Elkins High School in Missouri City, Texas. The pair self-released an untitled EP exclusively via MySpace, consisting of eight tracks such as \"No Introductions,\" \"Day N' Nite,\" and \"Dream,\" which showcased early experimentation with production and rapping influenced by artists like Kanye West and Kid Cudi.\n\nAfter graduating high school in 2009, Scott enrolled in community college in Houston but dropped out during his second year, using funds intended for tuition and supplies to finance a move to New York City in pursuit of a music career. There, he immersed himself in the industry by producing beats, uploading demos online, and cold-calling labels for unpaid internships to gain experience in recording and A\\u0026R processes. His persistence led to initial production credits and connections, including work on early tracks that caught the attention of established figures in hip hop.\n\nBy 2012, Scott's networking efforts culminated in key deals that formalized his entry into major label structures. He signed his first major-label recording contract with Epic Records, securing resources for recording and distribution. In November of that year, he inked a publishing agreement with Kanye West's GOOD Music as part of its production wing, Very GOOD Beats, positioning him as an in-house producer amid West's orbit. These agreements, negotiated amid Scott's relocation between New York and Los Angeles, provided creative autonomy while leveraging GOOD Music's infrastructure, though they emphasized production over immediate artist releases.\n\n### Mixtape Era and Independent Releases (2012–2014)\n\nFollowing his signing to Epic Records and association with Grand Hustle Records in 2012, Travis Scott chose to release free mixtapes rather than immediately pursuing a commercial debut album, aiming to cultivate a dedicated fanbase through independent-style projects. This approach allowed him to experiment with production and showcase his emerging psychedelic trap aesthetic, characterized by heavy auto-tune vocals, atmospheric synths, and high-energy beats.\n\nScott's debut mixtape, *Owl Pharaoh*, was released for free on May 21, 2013, via SoundCloud under Grand Hustle and Epic. The 14-track project, largely self-produced by Scott, featured guest appearances including A$AP Ferg on \"Uptown\" and showcased tracks like \"Upper Echelon,\" which highlighted his chaotic, genre-blending style blending hip-hop with electronic and rock influences. Critics noted its ambitious but uneven execution, with Stereogum describing it as a \"messy splurge of ideas, both good and bad,\" praising its innovative energy while critiquing inconsistencies.\n\nBuilding on this foundation, Scott prepared his second mixtape, *Days Before Rodeo*, which served as a precursor to his anticipated debut album *Rodeo*. The lead single, \"Don't Play\" featuring Big Sean and The 1975, was released on May 6, 2014, emphasizing Scott's ability to fuse rap with indie rock elements. The full 12-track mixtape dropped for free on August 18, 2014, via SoundCloud and Grand Hustle, with production primarily by Scott alongside contributors like Mike Dean. Notable features included Rich Homie Quan and Young Thug on \"Mamacita,\" T.I. on \"SportsCenter,\" and Migos on \"Quintana Pt. 2,\" tracks that amplified the mixtape's club-ready, mosh-inducing vibe.\n\n*Days Before Rodeo* received acclaim for its cohesive production and heightened ambition, with Pitchfork later highlighting its restraint compared to Scott's fuller later works, crediting standout beats and vocal performances. The project solidified Scott's reputation for immersive, rage-fueled live shows and atmospheric soundscapes, generating significant buzz and paving the way for his major label breakthrough, as evidenced by sold-out promotional performances in cities like Atlanta.\n\n### Major Label Debut and Breakthrough (2015–2016)\n\nTravis Scott released his debut studio album, *Rodeo*, on September 4, 2015, through Grand Hustle Records and Epic Records. The album featured collaborations with artists including Future, 2 Chainz, The Weeknd, Swae Lee, and Chief Keef, and included singles such as \"3500\" released on July 10, 2015. *Rodeo* debuted at number three on the US Billboard 200 chart and topped the Rap Albums chart, selling 70,000 album-equivalent units in its first week. The project marked Scott's transition from mixtapes to a full-length major-label release, building on prior independent work and production credits with Kanye West's GOOD Music.\n\nFollowing *Rodeo*, Scott's single \"Antidote\" from the album gained significant traction, peaking at number 14 on the Billboard Hot 100 in early 2016 and achieving triple platinum certification by the RIAA. This success propelled Scott's visibility, leading to extensive touring including the Rodeo Tour, which spanned late 2015 into 2016 with over 100 performances. The tour showcased high-energy live productions incorporating pyrotechnics and elaborate stage designs, contributing to Scott's reputation for immersive concert experiences.\n\nIn 2016, Scott achieved a commercial breakthrough with his second studio album, *Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight*, released on September 2 via the same labels. The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, marking Scott's first chart-topping release and selling over 88,000 units in its debut week. Featuring tracks like \"Goosebumps\" with Kendrick Lamar and \"Pick Up the Phone\" with Young Thug and Drake, it solidified Scott's trap-influenced sound and auto-tuned vocal style as mainstream forces. This period established Scott as a leading figure in hip-hop, with *Birds* outperforming *Rodeo* in streaming and sales longevity.\n\n### Label Expansion and Collaborative Projects (2017–2018)\n\nIn March 2017, Travis Scott founded Cactus Jack Records as a vanity label and imprint under Epic Records, with the primary goal of nurturing new talent alongside his own projects. The label quickly became a platform for Scott's creative control, incorporating publishing through Cactus Jack Publishing.\n\nA key collaborative effort emerged later that year with the release of *Huncho Jack, Jack Huncho* on December 21, 2017, a joint album by Scott and Quavo under the duo name Huncho Jack. Distributed via Cactus Jack, Grand Hustle, Epic, Quality Control, and other imprints, the 13-track project featured production from Mike Dean and Southside, blending trap beats with auto-tuned hooks; it debuted at number three on the US Billboard 200, selling 68,000 album-equivalent units in its first week.\n\nLabel expansion continued into 2018 with the signing of Sheck Wes on February 2, in a joint venture between Cactus Jack, Interscope Records, and Kanye West's GOOD Music. This deal supported Wes's rising profile, particularly around his viral single \"Mo Bamba,\" and marked Cactus Jack's initial push to build a roster beyond Scott. Similarly, Houston rapper Don Toliver joined the label in 2018, further diversifying its artist base ahead of Scott's *Astroworld* album release on August 3, 2018, which was issued under the Cactus Jack banner.\n\n### Documentary, Group Efforts, and Interim Releases (2019–2020)\n\nIn August 2019, Travis Scott released the documentary *Look Mom I Can Fly* exclusively on Netflix, chronicling the period surrounding the creation and promotion of his 2018 album *Astroworld*. The 84-minute film details Scott's creative process, including studio sessions with producers like Mike Dean, as well as personal challenges such as family dynamics and his relationship with Kylie Jenner. Directed by the trio of Scott's creative collaborators, it premiered on August 28, 2019, and received mixed reviews, with some critics praising its raw portrayal of artistic ambition while others noted its self-indulgent elements.\n\nThroughout 2019, Scott focused on elevating his Cactus Jack Records imprint through collective projects, signing artists like Don Toliver and Sheck Wes to build a roster emphasizing trap-influenced hip-hop and psychedelic production. The label's flagship group effort culminated in the compilation album *JackBoys*, released on December 27, 2019, via Cactus Jack and Epic Records, featuring seven tracks from label affiliates. Key contributors included Scott on tracks like \"GANG GANG\" and the remix of \"HIGHEST IN THE ROOM\" with Lil Baby and Rosalía, alongside solo cuts from Don Toliver (\"Can't Say\") and Sheck Wes (\"Mo Bamba (Remix)\"). The project highlighted the collective's sound—blending auto-tuned melodies, heavy bass, and mosh-pit energy—serving as a showcase for Cactus Jack's emerging talent rather than a traditional Travis Scott solo release.\n\nInterim releases bridged Scott's solo work during this period, including the single \"HIGHEST IN THE ROOM\" on October 4, 2019, which debuted at number four on the Billboard Hot 100 before its remix inclusion on *JackBoys*. In December 2019, he collaborated with Ed Sheeran on \"Antisocial,\" a track from Sheeran's *No.6 Collaborations Project* that peaked at number 37 on the Hot 100, fusing Scott's hazy production with pop-rap hooks. Extending into 2020 amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Scott formed the duo The Scotts with Kid Cudi, releasing their self-titled EP on May 15, 2020, which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 with tracks like \"THE SCOTTS\" emphasizing atmospheric synths and introspective lyrics. These efforts maintained Scott's momentum without a full solo album, prioritizing collaborations and label development until later projects.\n\n### Recovery, Utopia, and Ongoing Tours (2021–present)\n\nFollowing the crowd surge at the Astroworld Festival on November 5, 2021, during Scott's headline performance in Houston, Texas, which resulted in 10 deaths from compression asphyxia and hundreds of injuries, Scott faced extensive scrutiny and litigation. A Houston grand jury declined to bring criminal charges against him on June 29, 2023, citing insufficient evidence of criminal intent or negligence on his part. All 10 wrongful death lawsuits filed by victims' families were settled out of court by May 2024, with the final settlement involving the family of 9-year-old victim Ezra Blount reached on May 23, 2024.  By October 2024, Scott and promoter Live Nation had settled nearly 100 personal injury claims ahead of an upcoming civil trial, though thousands of additional injury suits remained pending. \n\nScott resumed live performances in the aftermath, including headlining Coachella in April 2022 and appearing at the 2022 Grammy Awards, signaling a professional recovery amid ongoing civil proceedings. His fourth studio album, *Utopia*, was released on July 28, 2023, via Cactus Jack Records and Epic Records. The project debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 with 496,000 album-equivalent units in its first week, marking the third-largest opening week of 2023 and Scott's third consecutive chart-topping solo album. It also achieved his first number-one position on the UK Albums Chart and reached platinum certification in the United States by August 25, 2023, driven by strong streaming performance exceeding one million equivalent units sold shortly after release. \n\nTo support *Utopia*, Scott launched the Utopia Tour Presents Circus Maximus in August 2023, featuring elaborate stage production with circus-themed elements and guest appearances. The tour initially covered North American arenas, grossing millions and selling out venues like Chicago's United Center, before extending into 2024 with additional U.S. dates in cities including Louisville and Montreal. International legs followed, encompassing Europe (e.g., GelreDome in Arnhem, Netherlands, on June 28, 2024), South America starting September 7, 2024, in Chile, and further stops in Mexico, Puerto Rico, Australia, and Asia.  As of October 2025, the tour continued with scheduled performances in New Delhi, India, on October 19, 2025, and Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, reflecting sustained global demand despite the absence of Houston dates.\n\n## Business Ventures\n\n### Cactus Jack Records\n\nCactus Jack Records is an independent record label founded by rapper Travis Scott in March 2017. Scott established the imprint to nurture emerging talent, emphasizing support for other artists over personal financial autonomy, as he explained in a 2017 interview. The label maintains an exclusive distribution partnership with Epic Records, handling releases for Scott and its roster through Sony Music.\n\nThe label's artist roster includes rappers Don Toliver, Sheck Wes, SoFaygo, and Wallie the Sensei, along with producer Chase B; former signees encompass Smokepurpp and Malú Trevejo.  Key projects spotlight these acts via compilation albums, such as the December 2019 release *JackBoys*, which assembled tracks from Scott and label affiliates including Toliver and Wes.\n\nIn July 2025, Cactus Jack issued *JackBoys 2*, featuring contributions from Toliver, Wes, SoFaygo, Wallie the Sensei, and additional collaborators, which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 with 232,000 album-equivalent units, including 160,000 in pure sales. Scott's solo efforts, including *Astroworld* in 2018, have also appeared under the Cactus Jack banner in conjunction with Epic, contributing to the label's output of certified hits like the platinum single \"Nightcrawler.\"\n\n### Fashion and Sneaker Collaborations\n\nTravis Scott's fashion collaborations emphasize streetwear aesthetics infused with his Cactus Jack branding, often blending urban cowboy motifs, distressed elements, and custom graphics across apparel and accessories. In January 2017, he partnered with Helmut Lang on a limited-edition 19-piece men's capsule collection, including T-shirts, denim jeans, bomber jackets, hoodies, and leather goods, drawing inspiration from urban cowboy themes and reinterpreting archival designs from the brand's Spring/Summer 2004 lineup. That same year, Scott collaborated with Ksubi on a range of distressed denim pieces, bomber jackets, T-shirts, and hoodies featuring flaming skull graphics and co-branded logos. Earlier efforts included a 2016 capsule with Bape featuring limited-edition Baby Milo T-shirts sold at ComplexCon, and a Maharishi \"Year of the Cowboy\" collection with sheriff-patched hats, sweatshirts, trousers, and tour jackets.\n\nIn June 2021, Scott co-designed Dior Men's Spring/Summer 2022 collection with artistic director Kim Jones, marking the first such collaboration between the luxury house and a rapper; it incorporated Cactus Jack motifs into Dior's historic Oblique monogram pattern across tailored pieces, tracksuits, Saddles bags, and accessories, debuting at Paris Fashion Week. Select items from the collection, including the Dior B713 sneaker in eight colorways inspired by Y2K skate shoes, released in July 2022 for $1,450 per pair, with proceeds partly directed to Scott's Project H.E.A.L. community initiative. Despite the Astroworld Festival tragedy in November 2021 prompting indefinite postponement of some planned \"Cactus Jack Dior\" products originally slated for January 2022 launch, the partnership proceeded with limited apparel and footwear drops.\n\nScott's sneaker collaborations, primarily with Nike and its Jordan Brand subsidiary, commenced in November 2017 with the Air Force 1 Low \"AF100\" Triple-White edition, released at $150 to commemorate the model's 35th anniversary and featuring early Cactus Jack branding. The partnership expanded to Jordan Brand with the Air Jordan 4 \"Cactus Jack\" in June 2018, priced at $225 and drawing from Houston Oilers colors, followed by additional Air Force 1 variants like the \"Sail\" in August 2018. Key subsequent releases include the Air Jordan 1 High \"Mocha\" in May 2019 ($175), Air Jordan 6 \"Medium Olive\" in October 2019 ($250), and Air Jordan 1 Low \"Reverse Mocha\" in July 2022 ($150), characterized by signature reversed Swooshes, earthy palettes, and desert-inspired detailing across over 25 models by late 2024. In 2024, Scott launched his signature Jordan Jumpman Jack line, with the \"Sail\" colorway debuting April 30 at $200, followed by \"University Red\" on May 10 and \"Mocha\" on November 26, emphasizing performance features like reinforced uppers for stage use. These drops often involve limited quantities, friends-and-family exclusives, and raffles, contributing to resale values exceeding original prices by factors of 5-10 times due to high demand.\n\n### Major Brand Partnerships\n\nTravis Scott has secured high-profile partnerships with global brands, leveraging his Cactus Jack imprint to integrate music, fashion, and consumer products. These collaborations often align with album releases or cultural events, generating substantial revenue estimated in tens of millions annually across deals.\n\nIn September 2020, Scott partnered with McDonald's to launch the \"Travis Scott Meal,\" featuring a Quarter Pounder with cheese, bacon, lettuce, and sauce alongside fries and a Sprite, available nationwide in the U.S. The deal included branded merchandise like socks, T-shirts, and mugs sold separately, contributing to an estimated $20 million in earnings for Scott from direct payments and merch sales. The promotion boosted McDonald's U.S. sales amid pandemic recovery, with the chain reporting elevated drive-thru traffic and overall revenue uplift attributed partly to the celebrity tie-in.\n\nScott's ongoing collaboration with Nike, initiated around 2017 through Jordan Brand, has produced signature sneakers under the Cactus Jack label, including the Air Jordan 4 \"Cactus Jack\" released on June 9, 2018, featuring reversed Swoosh logos, paint splatter details, and heel branding. Subsequent drops like the Air Jordan 1 and Jumpman Jack models have sold out rapidly, with Nike paying Scott approximately $10 million yearly for creative input and endorsements. These partnerships emphasize Scott's influence in streetwear, blending his aesthetic with Nike's performance heritage.\n\nIn fashion, Scott collaborated with Dior Men for the Spring/Summer 2022 collection, unveiled at Paris Fashion Week on June 25, 2021, incorporating Cactus Jack motifs into tailored suiting and accessories that reinterpreted Dior's historic codes. Originally slated for early 2022 release, the capsule faced postponement following the Astroworld Festival incident but launched in stores on July 7, 2022.\n\nAdditional ventures include a 2020 creative partnership with PlayStation for the PS5 launch, featuring Scott in promotional content and earning at least $1 million. He also headlined a virtual Fortnite concert with Epic Games in April 2020, drawing 27 million viewers and generating $20 million in revenue through in-game purchases and branding. These deals underscore Scott's role in bridging entertainment and consumer tech.\n\n### Media and Entertainment Involvement\n\nTravis Scott has ventured into film acting, most notably starring in the 2023 surreal action film *Aggro Dr1ft*, directed by Harmony Korine and shot entirely in infrared footage. In the film, Scott portrays a supporting role alongside lead actor Jordi Mollà as an assassin navigating a demonic underworld, marking one of his earliest substantial acting credits beyond music-related projects. The movie premiered at the Venice Film Festival in September 2023 and received a limited theatrical release in 2024, with critics noting its experimental style but divided reception on its narrative coherence.\n\nScott served as the central subject and executive producer for the 2019 Netflix documentary *Look Mom I Can Fly*, which chronicles the creation of his album *Astroworld*, personal challenges including fatherhood, and tour preparations. Directed by Nicolas Heller, the film was released on August 28, 2019, and provides intimate access to Scott's creative process amid controversies like festival disputes. It garnered attention for its raw portrayal but faced criticism for glossing over certain relational dynamics.\n\nIn virtual entertainment, Scott headlined the \"Astronomical\" in-game concert event within *Fortnite* on April 24–25, 2020, attracting 12.3 million concurrent players across multiple showings and a total of 27 million unique viewers. The performance featured custom visuals, a giant avatar of Scott transforming amid psychedelic environments, and premiered his track \"The Scotts\" with Kid Cudi, setting records for virtual music events during the COVID-19 lockdowns. This collaboration with Epic Games highlighted Scott's adaptation to digital platforms, influencing subsequent virtual concerts by other artists.\n\nScott made a live appearance at WWE's *Monday Night Raw* on January 6, 2025, during its Netflix streaming debut at the Intuit Dome in Inglewood, California, where he escorted wrestler Jey Uso to the ring and hyped the crowd. His entrance incorporated his music as the show's theme, marking his professional wrestling debut and blending hip-hop with sports entertainment. The event drew significant viewership, with Scott also interacting backstage, further expanding his crossover appeal.\n\nScott has made cameo appearances in television series such as *Lovecraft Country* (2020), contributing to episodes through musical integration or brief on-screen presence, and performed on shows like *The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon*. These roles, often tied to soundtrack contributions rather than scripted acting, underscore his selective forays into scripted media outside music production.\n\n## Artistry\n\n### Influences and Inspirations\n\nTravis Scott has frequently identified Kid Cudi as a central influence, praising his innovative fusion of hip-hop with melodic and introspective elements that informed Scott's own auto-tuned vocal style and atmospheric production. In a 2018 interview, Scott described Cudi as his favorite artist, stating, \"I idolize Kid Cudi a lot,\" and asserting that Cudi's lyrical prowess could rival that of Jay-Z. This admiration traces back to Scott's formative years; in a college admissions essay that surfaced in 2024, he detailed how Cudi's passion for music inspired him to drop out of college and pursue a career in hip-hop, viewing Cudi's risks as a model for artistic commitment.\n\nKanye West represents another pivotal inspiration, particularly in expansive production and genre-blending ambition, with Scott crediting West's endorsement and mentorship for launching his career after interning on West's *Yeezus* tour in 2013. Scott has echoed West's experimental ethos in creating immersive, psychedelic soundscapes, as seen in his early mixtapes that built on the sonic foundations laid by West's GOOD Music collective.\n\nAdditional influences include producers like Pete Rock and Pharrell Williams for their sampling and beat-making techniques, as well as M.I.A. for her boundary-pushing energy, which Scott highlighted in a 2015 Hot 97 interview as life-saving inspirations during his come-up. He has also drawn from rock acts like Nirvana, incorporating their chaotic live energy into his performances, and indie artists such as Bon Iver for textural depth in instrumentation. These diverse sources underscore Scott's synthesis of hip-hop, rock, and electronic elements into a signature \"psychedelic trap\" aesthetic.\n\n### Musical Style and Production Techniques\n\nTravis Scott's musical style fuses trap hip-hop with psychedelic and ambient elements, characterized by atmospheric instrumentals, heavy basslines, and multi-layered synths that create immersive, disorienting sonic environments. This approach draws from influences like Kid Cudi's melodic structures, emphasizing mood over strict narrative lyricism, as evidenced in tracks from his debut album *Rodeo*, released on September 4, 2015. His vocals feature prominent Auto-Tune application—not merely for pitch correction but as a core stylistic tool—to produce a warped, melodic distortion, often layered with energetic ad-libs such as \"straight up\" or \"it's lit,\" which enhance the hypnotic, crowd-chanting energy of his performances.\n\nIn production techniques, Scott employs meticulous vocal engineering, including pitch shifting and multiple overdubbed tracks, to build dense auditory textures that prioritize emotional immersion over clarity, as demonstrated in *Astroworld* (released August 3, 2018). He collaborates closely with producer Mike Dean, who integrates music theory principles like E-flat minor chords for suspenseful tension and resolution, shifting to relative majors for fleeting uplift, while incorporating Houston-specific samples such as Big Hawk's flows to ground the psychedelic abstraction in regional trap roots. This method contrasts traditional hip-hop production's linear songwriting and minimalism by favoring experimental, tech-driven iteration—refining beats over months with added elements like harmonica solos or opera flourishes—resulting in a signature \"journey\" structure per track.\n\nScott's sound has evolved from the raw, sample-heavy psychedelia of *Days Before Rodeo* (2014 mixtape) and *Rodeo*, which pioneered broader trap subgenre expansion through layered melodies, to the polished, theory-infused expanses of *Astroworld* and *Utopia* (released July 28, 2023), where production amplifies stadium-scale immersion with distorted saturation and reverb tails. Self-production credits on tracks like \"Stargazing\" from *Astroworld* highlight his hands-on role in EQ boosts for high-end presence (10-20 kHz) and sidechained distortion, techniques that replicate live chaos in studio recordings. This progression reflects a causal emphasis on sonic innovation driving listener engagement, with empirical streaming data underscoring the style's commercial viability—*Astroworld* amassed over 5 million equivalent album units in its first year—while avoiding over-reliance on formulaic beats.\n\n### Creative Vision and Thematic Elements\n\nTravis Scott's creative vision emphasizes immersive, cinematic experiences that integrate music, visuals, and live performances to evoke surreal, euphoric states. He conceptualizes albums as expansive worlds, drawing from Houston's cultural landscape and personal introspection to craft narratives of escapism and excess. This approach manifests in elaborate rollouts resembling blockbuster films and concerts that prioritize sensory overload, redefining traditional hip-hop staging.\n\nThematic elements in Scott's work frequently explore the duality of chaos and order, light and dark, often symbolized through contrasting imagery of nature, technology, and psychedelic motifs. His music delves into hedonism, drug-induced altered realities, and the paradoxes of fame, portraying lavish lifestyles alongside paranoia and isolation. These themes reflect a pursuit of utopian ideals amid dystopian realities, where personal struggles with relationships and identity underscore tracks blending trap beats with experimental production.\n\nIn *Astroworld* (2018), Scott pays homage to Houston's defunct Six Flags AstroWorld park, using amusement park metaphors to depict fame as a thrilling yet perilous ride, incorporating themes of drugs, excess, and hometown pride through psychedelic trap soundscapes. The album's narrative arc traces entry into a fantastical realm, escalating from euphoria to introspection on fame's toll.\n\nScott's 2023 album *Utopia* extends this vision by positing that \"utopia is wherever you are,\" illustrating attainable escapist havens through tracks addressing rebellion, apathy, and fame's elusive highs. Producers and collaborators highlight its conceptual depth, flipping familiar samples into eerie, meditative explorations of mortality and desire, maintaining continuity with prior works via earthy, shadowy palettes evoking transience. Songs like \"Meltdown\" and \"Sirens\" confront insatiable pursuits and siren calls of celebrity, blending raw emotion with innovative flows to critique modern excess.\n\n## Philanthropy\n\n### Cactus Jack Foundation Initiatives\n\nThe Cactus Jack Foundation, founded by Travis Scott, directs resources toward youth empowerment through education and creative opportunities, with a emphasis on underserved communities in Houston. Its initiatives include targeted scholarships and partnerships aimed at alleviating financial barriers and fostering skill development.\n\nThe Waymon Webster Scholarship Fund, honoring Scott's grandfather, prioritizes support for students at historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) facing economic challenges. Established in November 2020 amid pandemic-related disruptions, the program disbursed $1 million total—$10,000 per recipient—to 100 graduating HBCU seniors in 2022, covering tuition and related costs to enable degree completion. The foundation sustains this effort by awarding $10,000 scholarships annually to high-achieving HBCU enrollees, prioritizing those with demonstrated academic merit and financial need.\n\nIn creative fields, the foundation partnered with the Fashion Scholarship Fund to launch the Cactus Jack Design Ethos 101 Program in early 2025, selecting participants for $10,000 grants plus mentorship in design principles and industry practices; initial awards targeted two students from the fund's network, with selections based on submitted projects.\n\nA October 2025 collaboration with Space Center Houston introduced a STEM initiative for Houston Independent School District students, incorporating virtual and in-person workshops at TXRX Labs on three Saturdays; participants engage in hands-on engineering tasks—such as brainstorming, prototyping, and testing—while consulting NASA engineers to build competencies in design and space exploration careers.\n\nTo amplify fundraising and visibility, the foundation organizes the annual HBCU Celebrity Softball Classic, with the third event on February 13, 2025, at Minute Maid Park featuring Scott and celebrity participants; proceeds bolster scholarships and programs aligned with the foundation's youth-focused mission.\n\n### Project Heal and Other Efforts\n\nIn March 2022, Travis Scott announced Project HEAL, a multi-tier philanthropic initiative through his Cactus Jack Foundation aimed at addressing safety challenges at large-scale events and supporting youth from marginalized and at-risk communities. The program committed $5 million to Texas-based community efforts, including academic scholarships, free mental health resources, creative design centers, and investments in event safety technologies and training protocols. A portion of proceeds from Scott's Cactus Jack x Nike Air Max 1 collaboration, released in June 2022, was directed toward the initiative.\n\nProject HEAL's rollout included plans for product development related to event safety, though updates on implementation have been limited since the initial 2022 announcement. The effort emerged four months after the Astroworld Festival crowd crush in November 2021, which resulted in ten deaths, prompting Scott to emphasize safer event environments through partnerships and resource allocation.\n\nBeyond Project HEAL, the Cactus Jack Foundation has conducted annual holiday toy and food drives; in December 2024, its fifth Winter Wonderland Park event distributed 2,000 toys and bicycles to underprivileged children in Houston. In September 2025, the foundation partnered with the Fashion Scholarship Fund to launch the Cactus Jack Design Ethos 101 Program, providing $10,000 awards and mentorship to students pursuing fashion and design education. Additionally, Scott donated $500,000 to community initiatives in partnership with the NFL ahead of his 2024 Super Bowl halftime performance.\n\n## Personal Life\n\n### Relationships and Family\n\nTravis Scott was born Jacques Bermon Webster II on April 30, 1991, in Houston, Texas, to parents Jacques Webster Sr., a musician and drummer who influenced his son's interest in music, and Wanda Webster, who shaped his fashion sense. He has two younger siblings, fraternal twins Jordan Webster (sister) and Joshua Webster (brother), born June 14, 2000; Joshua is nonverbal and autistic, a fact Scott has publicly discussed to highlight themes of acceptance and family support.\n\nScott's most prominent romantic relationship is with entrepreneur Kylie Jenner, which began in April 2017 after they met at Coachella. The couple welcomed daughter Stormi Webster on February 1, 2018, followed by son Aire Webster (originally named Wolf Jacques Webster, renamed in January 2023) on February 2, 2022.\n\nTheir partnership has been on-and-off, with a split in October 2019 after two years together, a reconciliation in early 2020, and another breakup in late 2022 amid reported lifestyle differences, including Scott's touring demands contrasting Jenner's home-focused routine. Despite separations, they maintain co-parenting arrangements, evidenced by shared family activities such as a Disneyland outing with Stormi and Aire in October 2025 and cowboy-themed photos posted by Scott in April 2025.\n\n### Lifestyle and Public Persona\n\nTravis Scott owns several luxury residences, including a 17,000-square-foot ultra-modern mansion in Brentwood, Los Angeles, valued at $23.5 million, and multiple properties in Houston, Texas, such as a $14 million estate purchased in November 2021 and an $8 million home.\nHis vehicle collection features exotic supercars like a Bugatti Chiron, Lamborghini Huracán, Lamborghini Aventador, Ferrari 488, LaFerrari, and Range Rovers, reflecting an affinity for high-performance automobiles that he has described as numerous enough to lose track of.\nScott incorporates fitness into his regimen through rigorous weight training, frequently training alongside other rappers to maintain physical conditioning amid demanding tour schedules.\n\nScott's public persona revolves around entrepreneurial versatility and cultural disruption, leveraging his Cactus Jack imprint to forge high-profile partnerships across industries, including apparel with Nike, fast food with McDonald's in 2020, and luxury fashion with Dior.\nHe projects an image of innovative self-promotion, integrating psychedelic visuals, immersive experiences, and youth-oriented aesthetics that transcend music into lifestyle branding, though he has expressed aversion to explicit terms like \"branding\" or \"marketing.\"\nThis cultivated identity emphasizes relentless energy and boundary-pushing creativity, solidifying his status as a tastemaker in hip-hop and streetwear subcultures.\n\n## Controversies and Legal Matters\n\n### Concert-Related Incidents\n\nTravis Scott's concerts have repeatedly featured high-energy crowd participation, including encouragement of moshing, stage rushing, and barrier breaches, contributing to a pattern of injuries, arrests, and disruptions. This approach, integral to his performance aesthetic, has blurred boundaries between audience and stage, heightening risks in densely packed venues despite security measures. Prior to the 2021 Astroworld Festival, several incidents underscored these hazards, involving direct actions by Scott to incite chaotic behavior.\n\nDuring his August 2015 set at Lollapalooza in Chicago's Grant Park, Scott halted his performance briefly but then urged fans to climb security barricades and rush the stage, overwhelming personnel and prompting his arrest. He faced charges of misdemeanor reckless conduct for endangering attendees; Scott pleaded guilty, receiving one year of court supervision and fines. No severe fan injuries were reported, but the event highlighted tensions between his style and venue safety protocols.\n\nOn May 13, 2017, at the Walmart AMP in Rogers, Arkansas, Scott explicitly called for fans to bypass security and storm the stage during his headline performance, leading to multiple injuries among attendees, a security employee, and a police officer. Arrested post-show, he was charged with inciting a riot, disorderly conduct, and endangering a minor; in 2018, two charges were dropped, and he pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct, agreeing to pay over $6,800 in restitution to two injured fans.\n\nWeeks earlier, on April 30, 2017, at Terminal 5 in New York City, video captured Scott directing a fan, identified as Kyle Green, to \"jump\" from a third-floor balcony into the pit below, after which Green fell, suffering spinal injuries that left him partially paralyzed and requiring a wheelchair. Green filed a civil lawsuit against Scott, the venue, and security firms, alleging negligence in crowd control and failure to prevent the fall. The case illustrated how Scott's on-stage prompts could escalate dangers in multi-level venues.\n\nThese pre-2021 events, while not fatal, established a record of Scott prioritizing immersive chaos over immediate safety signals, often resulting in legal accountability shared with promoters but tied to his directives. Investigations into subsequent incidents, including Astroworld, referenced this history as context for systemic failures in risk assessment by artists, organizers, and enforcers.\n\n#### Astroworld Festival Tragedy\n\nOn November 5, 2021, during the Astroworld Festival at NRG Park in Houston, Texas, a crowd surge occurred amid rapper Travis Scott's headline performance, resulting in a deadly crush that killed 10 attendees aged 9 to 27 via compression asphyxia. The event, attended by approximately 50,000 people, featured multiple stages and artists, but the main-stage area became overcrowded as fans pushed forward, breaching barriers and overwhelming security. Houston Fire Department Chief Samuel Peña reported that medical personnel treated over 300 individuals for injuries ranging from dehydration to cardiac arrest, with the youngest fatality being 9-year-old Ezra Blount.\n\nThe surge began shortly after Scott took the stage around 9:00 p.m., exacerbated by fans climbing barricades and a lack of sufficient perimeter control, as documented in Houston Police Department incident reports. Organizers, including Live Nation, had approved a capacity that reports later deemed inadequate for crowd density, contributing to \"the perfect storm\" of factors like poor sightlines and delayed emergency response. Scott continued performing for about 30 minutes after security informed him of fatalities, including a message relaying \"three people have died,\" though he later claimed unawareness of the full severity and prioritized attendee safety by pausing to direct aid. Critics attributed partial causation to Scott's promotion of high-energy \"raging\" at prior events, but investigations highlighted systemic failures in planning and execution over individual artist encouragement.\n\nA 19-month Houston Police investigation culminated in a June 2023 grand jury decision not to indict Scott, Live Nation executives, or other principals on criminal charges, citing insufficient evidence of intent amid shared responsibility. The Texas Task Force on Concert Safety, formed post-incident, recommended enhanced regulations like real-time crowd monitoring and barrier standards, influencing industry reforms without assigning primary blame to performers. Civilly, over 2,500 lawsuits alleged negligence by Scott, Live Nation, and Apple (streaming partner); by May 2024, nine of 10 wrongful death suits settled confidentially, with the tenth pending, and hundreds of injury claims resolved ahead of a October 2024 trial. Scott denied liability, asserting cooperation with authorities and offering funeral expense coverage, which some families rejected.\n\n#### Other Performance Disruptions\n\nIn 2015, during his performance at Lollapalooza in Chicago on August 1, Scott urged fans to rush the stage and climb over security barricades, resulting in a stampede that disrupted the event and prompted his removal by security. He was arrested shortly after and charged with disorderly conduct, inciting a riot, and endangering the welfare of a child; Scott later pleaded guilty to reckless conduct. \n\nA similar incident occurred on May 30, 2017, at the Walmart AMP in Rogers, Arkansas, where Scott again encouraged attendees to bypass security and surge toward the stage, leading to chaos and his arrest for inciting a riot and disorderly conduct. \n\nOn July 4, 2022, at The Day Party event in New York City's Coney Art Walls, Scott halted his set mid-performance after spotting fans scaling a stage fixture, addressing the crowd to prioritize safety before resuming.\n\nDuring the Circus Maximus tour stop at Marvel Stadium in Melbourne, Australia, on October 21, 2024, pre-show disorder erupted outside as fans broke through barricades, threw bottles and trash, and engaged in physical altercations, while inside the venue reports emerged of a fan being assaulted and suffering a seizure amid mosh pit activity.  \n\nMost recently, on October 19, 2025, at Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in Delhi, India, Scott's set descended into chaos when overzealous fans pulled him off the stage, requiring security intervention to restore order.\n\n### Arrests and Criminal Charges\n\nTravis Scott has been arrested on multiple occasions, primarily for charges related to disorderly conduct, public intoxication, and altercations with security personnel, though most cases have resulted in dropped charges or no convictions.\n\nOn May 20, 2015, during his set at Lollapalooza in Chicago, Scott was arrested for disorderly conduct after repeatedly urging fans to rush the stage and climb barricades, leading to crowd surges. He faced misdemeanor charges, but the case was resolved through completion of anger management and community service, with no formal conviction. A similar incident occurred on May 30, 2017, at a concert in Little Rock, Arkansas, where Scott again encouraged fans to breach barriers, resulting in his arrest for inciting a riot; charges were dropped after he fulfilled probation requirements including community service.\n\nOn June 20, 2024, Scott was arrested at 1:44 a.m. in Miami Beach, Florida, on charges of trespassing and disorderly intoxication following a disturbance at the Miami Beach Marina. Police responded to reports of a drunken individual yelling profanities at passengers on a yacht; Scott refused multiple warnings to leave the private property and appeared intoxicated but cooperative during handcuffing. He posted a $650 bond and was released by 8:00 a.m. the same day. The State Attorney's Office dropped both misdemeanor charges on August 31, 2024, citing insufficient evidence for prosecution.\n\nIn Paris on August 9, 2024, Scott was arrested early in the morning at the George V hotel for alleged violence against a security guard. The guard intervened during a physical altercation between Scott and his own bodyguard inside the hotel. French prosecutors confirmed the arrest but released Scott later that day without filing charges, as the investigation found no basis for further action. Video footage showed security and police escorting Scott from the premises amid the commotion.\n\n#### Miami Beach Incident\n\n![Travis Scott mugshot (2024)][float-right]\n\nOn June 20, 2024, Travis Scott, whose legal name is Jacques Bermon Webster II, was arrested in Miami Beach, Florida, on charges of disorderly intoxication and trespassing after an altercation at the Miami Beach Marina.  According to police reports, Scott had been yelling and causing a disturbance directed at individuals on a yacht docked at the marina, appearing heavily intoxicated. Officers issued a trespassing warning, which Scott allegedly ignored, leading to his detention.\n\nBody camera footage released on August 8, 2024, captured the arrest, showing Scott being handcuffed after refusing to leave the area despite repeated instructions from Miami Beach police. He was booked into Miami-Dade County Jail around 4:35 a.m., with mugshots released publicly. Scott was released later that morning after posting a $5,000 bond for the combined misdemeanor charges.\n\nOn August 30, 2024, prosecutors dropped both charges, stating that the evidence did not support prosecution.  The decision followed review of the incident details, with no further legal action pursued against Scott in connection with the event.\n\n#### Paris Arrest\n\nOn August 9, 2024, Travis Scott was arrested in Paris following an altercation at the George V luxury hotel.  The incident occurred early in the morning and stemmed from a physical fight between Scott and his bodyguard, which escalated into a confrontation with a hotel security guard, whom Scott allegedly assaulted.  Scott was taken into police custody on suspicion of violence against a security agent. He was in Paris at the time for events related to the 2024 Summer Olympics.\n\nScott was released from custody on August 10, 2024, without any charges being filed.  The Paris prosecutor's office stated that the police custody order was lifted and all proceedings against him were terminated, classifying the incident as minor.  A representative for Scott confirmed the release and absence of charges. No further legal actions or investigations have been reported as of the latest available information.\n\n### Assault and Civil Allegations\n\nIn March 2023, Travis Scott faced allegations of assaulting a 52-year-old sound engineer during a DJ set at Nebula nightclub in Manhattan, New York City. The engineer claimed Scott punched him in the face, causing no visible injuries but prompting a police report, and that Scott damaged approximately $12,000 worth of audio-visual equipment. Scott's representatives characterized the incident as a \"misunderstanding\" and affirmed his cooperation with the New York Police Department investigation. No criminal charges were filed against Scott.\n\nOn August 9, 2024, Scott was arrested in Paris, France, following an alleged assault on a security guard at the George V hotel. French authorities reported that the incident stemmed from a physical altercation involving Scott, his bodyguard, and hotel security personnel, leading to minor injuries to the guard. Scott was detained briefly before being released without charges later that day, with prosecutors noting insufficient evidence for further action.\n\nIn February 2025, Omar Muhanna initiated a civil lawsuit against Scott in Manhattan, alleging assault and battery perpetrated by one of Scott's security guards on August 17, 2024, outside a concert venue. Muhanna asserted that the guard violently attacked him without provocation, resulting in injuries including a fractured orbital bone, and sought damages for medical expenses and pain. Scott's team dismissed the suit as \"frivolous and bogus,\" maintaining that Scott was performing elsewhere at the time and had no involvement or knowledge of the alleged events. The case remains pending.\n\n## Discography\n\n[Discography - no content]\n\n## Tours and Live Performances\n\nTravis Scott's tours emphasize immersive, high-energy experiences with custom stage designs, including pyrotechnics, elevated platforms, and interactive elements that encourage crowd participation such as mosh pits.\n\nHis debut headlining tour, the Rodeo Tour, began on March 1, 2015, at the Observatory in Santa Ana, California, supporting the release of his album *Rodeo*. Featuring Young Thug and Metro Boomin as opening acts, the North American outing included dates through spring 2015, such as a Houston stop on March 23.\n\nFollowing the September 2016 release of *Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight*, Scott launched the Birds Eye View Tour in March 2017, commencing with a festival appearance at Buku Music + Art Project in New Orleans on March 10. The tour encompassed approximately 40 shows across Phase 1, from April 12 in Santa Barbara, California, to June dates including Coachella weekends, with additional phases extending into July.\n\nThe Astroworld – Wish You Were Here Tour supported his 2018 album *Astroworld* and ran from November 2018 to October 2019, comprising 56 concerts noted for elaborate production mimicking an amusement park, including a functional rollercoaster element at select venues like Madison Square Garden.\n\nIn promotion of *Utopia* (2023), the Circus Maximus Tour debuted in August 2023 at MetLife Stadium, evolving into a global stadium run through 2025, with dates including FNB Stadium in Johannesburg on October 11, 2025. By late 2024, it had sold 1.7 million tickets and grossed over $200 million.\n\nScott has opened for major acts, including Kendrick Lamar's DAMN. Tour in 2017, and delivered notable festival sets, such as at Governors Ball and Lollapalooza in 2018, where his performances were highlighted for intense crowd energy.\n\n## Awards and Recognition\n\nTravis Scott has received ten Grammy Award nominations without a win, including Best Rap Album for *Utopia* at the 66th Annual Grammy Awards in 2024 and for contributions to Kanye West's *Donda* at the 64th in 2022. Other nominations encompass Best Rap Song for \"Sicko Mode\" in 2019, Best Melodic Rap Performance for \"Highest in the Room\" in 2021, and Best Rap Album for *Astroworld* in 2019.\n\nHe secured one Latin Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video for \"TKN\" (with Rosalía) at the 21st Annual Latin Grammy Awards on November 19, 2020.\n\nAt the BET Hip Hop Awards, Scott won the I Am Hip Hop Award in 2024, recognizing his influence as a rapper, producer, and entrepreneur; he accepted the honor during the ceremony taped on October 15, 2024. He has also earned multiple BET Hip Hop Awards in categories such as Best Video Director of the Year and Album of the Year for *Astroworld*.\n\nScott won an MTV Video Music Award for Best Hip-Hop Video for \"Franchise\" (with Young Thug and M.I.A.) in 2021. He received a Billboard Music Award, though specific category details remain less documented amid his frequent performances at the event, such as \"Mafia\" and \"Lost Forever\" at the 2022 ceremony.\n\n## Cultural Impact and Legacy\n\nTravis Scott's integration of psychedelic trap elements into hip-hop production has reshaped the genre's sonic landscape, emphasizing atmospheric soundscapes, distorted vocals, and experimental structures over conventional lyric-focused delivery. Drawing from influences like Kanye West's avant-garde techniques and Kid Cudi's melodic introspection, Scott's approach on albums such as *Rodeo* (2015) and *Astroworld* (2018) provided a template for mainstream rap's evolution toward genre fusion, enabling artists to prioritize immersive audio experiences.\n\nHis commercial dominance is evidenced by the *Circus Maximus Tour* in 2024, which grossed $209.3 million and became the highest-earning tour by a solo rapper, reflecting sustained fan engagement through high-production spectacles featuring pyrotechnics, custom stage designs, and crowd-surging energy. With over 170 million certified units sold in the United States alone, Scott's output has driven streaming records, including \"Highest in the Room\" surpassing 2 billion Spotify streams by April 2025, underscoring his role in expanding hip-hop's profitability via digital platforms and merchandise integration.\n\nScott's Cactus Jack brand has extended his influence into fashion and consumer culture, with collaborations like Nike's Air Jordan series—often selling out within minutes—and the 2020 McDonald's promotional meal, which boosted the chain's youth appeal and generated widespread media coverage. These partnerships exemplify a model of artist-driven branding that merges streetwear aesthetics with luxury, as seen in Dior menswear lines and Audemars Piguet watches, positioning Scott as a pivotal figure in hip-hop's convergence with corporate marketing strategies.",
