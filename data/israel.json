It shares borders with Lebanon to the north, Syria to the northeast, Jordan to the east, Egypt to the southwest, and the Palestinian territories of the West Bank and Gaza Strip to the east and west, respectively. Israel's capital, though internationally disputed, is Jerusalem, a city of profound religious and historical significance to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. As of 2023, Israel has a population of approximately 9.7 million people and covers an area of about 22,072 square kilometers (8,522 square miles), making it one of the smaller nations in the region [CIA World Factbook](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/israel/).\n\nIsrael is a parliamentary democracy with a diverse economy that includes high-tech industries, agriculture, and tourism. It is often described as the only democracy in the Middle East, though its political and territorial conflicts, particularly with the Palestinians, remain a central issue in global geopolitics [BBC Country Profile](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-14606476). The country is also a focal point of religious pilgrimage and cultural heritage, housing some of the holiest sites for multiple world religions.\n\n## Historical Background\n\n### Ancient History\nThe region now known as Israel has been inhabited for millennia and is often referred to as the \"Holy Land\" due to its significance in religious texts. Archaeological evidence suggests human presence dating back over 1.5 million years. The area was home to the ancient Kingdoms of Israel and Judah, which are central to Jewish history and the Hebrew Bible. Around 1000 BCE, King David established Jerusalem as the capital of a united Israelite kingdom, a legacy that continues to influence Jewish identity today [Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs](https://www.mfa.gov.il/mfa/aboutisrael/history/pages/history.aspx).\n\nThe region experienced successive periods of foreign rule, including by the Assyrians, Babylonians, Persians, Greeks, and Romans. During Roman rule, in 70 CE, the Second Temple in Jerusalem was destroyed, marking a significant event in Jewish history that led to the diaspora, or scattering, of Jewish communities worldwide [Jewish Virtual Library](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/the-second-temple).\n\n### Ottoman and British Rule\nFrom 1517 to 1917, the area was part of the Ottoman Empire, during which time it was administered as part of various provinces. Following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire in World War I, the region came under British control through the Mandate for Palestine, established by the League of Nations in 1920. During this period, tensions grew between Jewish immigrants, encouraged by the Zionist movement to return to their ancestral homeland, and the Arab population, who opposed large-scale Jewish immigration [United Nations](https://www.un.org/unispal/history/).\n\n### Establishment of the State of Israel\nOn May 14, 1948, following the end of the British Mandate and a United Nations partition plan (UN Resolution 181) that proposed the creation of independent Jewish and Arab states, David Ben-Gurion declared the independence of the State of Israel. This event triggered the first Arab-Israeli War, as neighboring Arab states rejected the partition plan and sought to prevent the establishment of a Jewish state. Israel emerged victorious, expanding its territory beyond the UN-proposed borders, while Jordan and Egypt occupied the West Bank and Gaza Strip, respectively [History.com](https://www.history.com/topics/middle-east/history-of-israel).\n\n### Conflicts and Peace Efforts\nSince its founding, Israel has been involved in several conflicts, including the 1956 Suez Crisis, the 1967 Six-Day War (during which Israel captured the West Bank, Gaza Strip, Sinai Peninsula, and Golan Heights), and the 1973 Yom Kippur War. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict remains unresolved, characterized by disputes over territory, security, and the right of return for Palestinian refugees. Peace efforts, such as the 1979 Camp David Accords with Egypt and the 1994 peace treaty with Jordan, have achieved some success, but a comprehensive resolution with the Palestinians remains elusive [Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/israeli-palestinian-conflict).\n\n## Current Status and Relevance\n\nIsrael is a significant player in international affairs, particularly in the Middle East. It maintains strong diplomatic and military ties with the United States, which provides substantial aid and support [U.S. Department of State](https://www.state.gov/countries-areas/israel/). However, its policies, particularly regarding settlements in the West Bank, are a source of contention and criticism from much of the international community, including the United Nations [UN News](https://news.un.org/en/tags/israel).\n\nDomestically, Israel faces challenges related to political polarization, economic inequality, and social tensions between secular and religious communities, as well as between Jewish and Arab citizens, who make up about 21% of the population. The ongoing conflict with Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon continues to pose security threats [BBC News](https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cq8n7y2j7vdt/israel).\n\nEconomically, Israel is a leader in innovation, often dubbed the \"Start-Up Nation\" due to its thriving technology sector. It ranks high in global indices for research and development investment and has a per capita GDP comparable to many Western nations [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/country/IL).\n\n## Notable Facts and Details\n\n- **Official Language**: Hebrew and Arabic are the official languages, though Hebrew is the primary language of government and daily life.
