  "content": "# Adele\n\nAdele Laurie Blue Adkins (born 5 May 1988) is an English singer-songwriter noted for her soul-influenced pop ballads and vocal prowess.\nRaised in London by a single mother, she discovered her musical talent early and pursued formal training at the BRIT School, where contemporaries included artists like Amy Winehouse, though her path emphasized personal narrative over genre experimentation.\n\nAdele debuted with the album *19* in 2008, which charted modestly but introduced her confessional style centered on heartbreak and relationships, themes derived from lived experiences rather than abstraction. Her second album, *21* (2011), propelled her to international fame, selling over 30 million copies worldwide through raw emotional delivery and hits like \"Rolling in the Deep,\" driven by organic demand rather than heavy promotion. Subsequent releases *25* (2015), with over 23 million units, and *30* (2021) sustained her commercial dominance, amassing equivalent album sales exceeding 119 million globally, reflecting sustained listener preference for substantive lyrical content amid streaming proliferation.\n\nShe has received 16 Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year for both *21* and *25*, recognizing production quality and artistic impact, alongside an Academy Award for the James Bond theme \"Skyfall,\" highlighting her versatility in film scoring. Despite intermittent career pauses for vocal cord surgery in 2011 and family priorities, her output consistently prioritizes authenticity, yielding enduring catalog value over ephemeral trends.\n\n## Early Life\n\n### Childhood and Family Background\n\nAdele Laurie Blue Adkins was born on 5 May 1988 in Tottenham, North London, England, as the only child of Penny Susan Adkins, an 18-year-old English art student from Islington, and Mark Evans, a Welsh man in his mid-20s.   Her parents met in a North London pub in 1987 and briefly lived together, but Evans departed when Adele was two years old, leaving Penny to raise her alone in working-class circumstances.  \n\nThe family experienced housing instability typical of low-income single-parent households, starting in Tottenham before relocating south around age 10 to Brixton and then West Norwood in the London Borough of Lambeth, where they resided from age 11 until Adele turned 18 in a modest flat above a discount store.   Penny, often characterized as a free-spirited \"hippie mum,\" navigated these challenges while fostering Adele's early development amid frequent moves and limited resources.  Adele later reflected on this period as formative, marked by the absence of her father and the resilience required in a transient urban environment.\n\n### Education and Initial Musical Exposure\n\nAdele Laurie Blue Adkins grew up in Tottenham, London, primarily listening to pop music during her early childhood, with the Spice Girls serving as a formative influence due to their energetic style and girl-group dynamics. At age five, her mother, Penny Adkins, introduced her to live music by attending the Great Xpectations festival in Finsbury Park, where she encountered English rock bands, broadening her initial exposure beyond radio pop. This period laid a casual foundation, but her deeper engagement with music intensified around age 14, when she began frequenting HMV's Antique Record Store and discovered soul and jazz recordings, particularly collections of Etta James and Ella Fitzgerald, which shifted her tastes toward R\\u0026B and vocal-centric genres.\n\nAt age 14, Adele secured admission to the BRIT School for Performing Arts and Technology in Croydon, south London, a publicly funded institution established in 1991 to nurture creative talents through specialized training in music, dance, and visual arts. She auditioned successfully by performing Stevie Wonder's \"Free\" vocally and James Rae's \"Tumbledown Blues\" on the clarinet, demonstrating early versatility beyond singing. During her time there from approximately 2002 to 2006, Adele honed her songwriting and performance skills in an environment that emphasized practical artistry, sharing the contemporary music program with peers like Leona Lewis and Jessie J, whose parallel trajectories underscored the school's role in fostering raw talent into professional output. The curriculum's focus on live performance and recording equipped her with technical proficiency, including guitar playing inspired by Amy Winehouse's 2003 album *Frank*, which Adele credited with prompting her to compose original material.\n\nAdele graduated from the BRIT School in May 2006, immediately leveraging her developed abilities by recording demo tracks that attracted industry attention via platforms like MySpace, marking the transition from educational exposure to commercial viability. This formal training contrasted with her self-directed discoveries, such as emulating the emotive delivery of influences like Etta James, whose recordings she encountered as mixtapes traded among friends, fostering a blend of instinctive passion and structured discipline that defined her nascent style.\n\n## Career\n\n### Debut and Early Recognition with 19 (2006–2010)\n\nIn 2006, Adele, then a student at the BRIT School, uploaded vocal demos to MySpace, attracting the attention of Nick Huggett, an A\\u0026R executive at XL Recordings, who contacted her assuming she was already signed. Huggett recommended her to manager Jonathan Dickins of September Management, who became her official representative in June 2006. This led to her signing with XL Recordings, marking the start of her professional career.\n\nHer debut single, \"Hometown Glory,\" was released on October 22, 2007, as a limited-edition vinyl through Pacemaker Recordings. The follow-up, \"Chasing Pavements,\" co-written with Eg White and released on January 14, 2008, debuted at number two on the UK Singles Chart, where it held the position for three weeks.  Her self-titled debut album, *19*—named for her age during recording—was released on January 28, 2008, entering the UK Albums Chart at number one after selling 73,341 copies in its first week.  The album's soulful tracks, including a cover of Bob Dylan's \"Make You Feel My Love\" released as a single in October 2008, showcased her powerful vocals and autobiographical lyrics rooted in heartbreak and introspection.\n\nEarly recognition came swiftly with the inaugural BRIT Critics' Choice Award in December 2007, voted by an industry panel for emerging talent. *19* earned a nomination for the 2008 Mercury Prize, highlighting its artistic merit despite commercial competition. In 2009, Adele received two Grammy Awards: Best New Artist and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for \"Chasing Pavements.\" To promote the album, she launched the *An Evening with Adele* tour in January 2008, performing 78 shows across Europe and North America through July 2009, though she canceled dates in Germany, Japan, and the US in September 2008 citing family issues.\n\nBy 2010, *19* had achieved multi-platinum status in the UK, with over 500,000 units sold domestically by the end of 2008, establishing Adele as a rising figure in British soul and pop. Critics praised her emotive delivery and maturity, drawing comparisons to influences like Etta James and Amy Winehouse, though her sound emphasized raw authenticity over stylistic imitation.\n\n### Global Breakthrough with 21 (2011–2014)\n\nAdele's second studio album, *21*, was released on 24 January 2011 in the United Kingdom via XL Recordings, marking a significant escalation from the modest success of her debut *19*. The lead single \"Rolling in the Deep,\" released in November 2010, propelled the album's anticipation by topping charts in multiple countries, including the United States where it debuted at number 68 on the Billboard Hot 100 in December 2010 before reaching number one. This track's blend of soul, gospel, and pop elements contrasted sharply with contemporary pop trends, contributing to its global resonance and Adele's emergence as a mainstream force.\n\n*21* achieved unprecedented commercial dominance, selling 18 million copies worldwide in 2011 alone, the highest for any album in a single year according to Guinness World Records. In the US, it debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 upon its 22 February 2011 release, accumulating 11 million sales by October 2014 and spending 24 non-consecutive weeks at the summit. Globally, *21* became the first album to top year-end charts in 2011 and 2012 consecutively, with over 31 million units sold by later counts, revitalizing album sales in a digital streaming era. Adele set multiple Guinness records, including being the first artist with a number-one album alongside three number-one singles in the US (\"Rolling in the Deep,\" \"Someone Like You,\" and \"Set Fire to the Rain\").\n\nThe album's success extended to critical acclaim and awards, with Adele sweeping six Grammy Awards at the 54th Annual Grammy Awards on 12 February 2012, tying the record for most wins by a female artist in one night, including Album of the Year and Record of the Year for \"Rolling in the Deep.\" However, her momentum was interrupted in October 2011 when she underwent surgery for vocal cord polyps, leading to tour cancellations and a period of recovery that delayed live performances until mid-2012. Despite this, *21* maintained chart longevity, with \"Someone Like You\" becoming a piano-led ballad staple that amplified emotional sales drivers.\n\nIn support of *21*, Adele embarked on the Adele Live tour from March to October 2011 across Europe and North America, performing to sold-out arenas before health issues halted it; a resumed leg in 2012 included dates in New Zealand and South America. By 2014, the album's enduring sales—adding 157,000 US copies that year alone—solidified her as a global superstar, with *21* certified 17x platinum in the US, the highest for any 21st-century release. This era underscored Adele's appeal through raw vocal power and heartbreak-themed songwriting, unadorned by autotune or heavy production, contrasting industry norms.\n\n### Sustained Dominance with 25 (2015–2017)\n\nAdele released her third studio album, *25*, on November 20, 2015, following a four-year hiatus from recording. The lead single, \"Hello,\" premiered on October 23, 2015, and its accompanying music video shattered the Vevo record for most views in 24 hours, accumulating 27.7 million views and surpassing Taylor Swift's previous mark. In its debut week, *25* sold 3.38 million copies in the United States alone, setting a new record for the largest first-week album sales since Nielsen SoundScan began tracking in 1991 and marking the first album to exceed three million units in that span. Globally, it achieved 5.706 million first-week sales, underscoring Adele's enduring commercial appeal amid a streaming-dominated industry.\n\nThe album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, holding the top position for ten non-consecutive weeks and blocking other major releases, including David Bowie's *Blackstar*. In the United Kingdom, *25* recorded the biggest opening week for any album in the 21st century, further cementing its dominance. By the end of 2015, it had sold over 14.97 million copies worldwide in under six weeks, positioning it as the year's top-selling album despite competition from digital platforms. The Recording Industry Association of America certified *25* diamond on September 22, 2016, for 10 million units shipped in the US, a feat achieved in less than a year and highlighting its physical sales strength.\n\nTo support *25*, Adele launched the Adele Live 2016 tour on February 29, 2016, spanning North America and Europe with over 120 shows and attracting 2.48 million attendees, generating $278.4 million in revenue—the fifth highest-grossing tour of 2016. Notable performances included her headline set at Glastonbury Festival in June 2016, drawing massive crowds and reinforcing her live draw. The tour concluded amid vocal challenges, with the final two Wembley Stadium dates in July 2017 canceled due to damaged vocal cords, yet it exemplified her ability to command arenas without relying on elaborate production.\n\nAt the 59th Grammy Awards on February 12, 2017, *25* won Album of the Year, while \"Hello\" secured Record of the Year and Song of the Year, affirming critical and industry validation of Adele's songcraft and vocal prowess. These accolades, alongside certifications like 11x platinum in the US by August 2017, solidified *25*'s role in sustaining Adele's preeminence through raw emotional resonance rather than trend-chasing.\n\n### 30, Las Vegas Residency, and Announced Hiatus (2018–present)\n\nFollowing the conclusion of her Adele Live 2016 tour in 2017, Adele entered a period of reduced public activity from 2018 onward, focusing on personal matters including her separation from Simon Konecki, which she announced in April 2019. During this time, she underwent vocal cord surgery in 2017 but maintained a low profile, occasionally sharing updates on social media about her divorce finalization in March 2021 and her work on new music. Her fourth studio album, *30*, was released on November 19, 2021, marking her return after a six-year gap since *25*.\n\n*30* debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart, earning 839,000 equivalent album units in its first week in the United States, including 692,000 in pure album sales, making it the largest debut week for any album since 2015. The album achieved over one million copies sold in the U.S. by early December 2021, becoming the first to do so in over a year and the top-selling album of 2021 globally with 1,586,000 equivalent sales in its debut week across markets. Critics praised its raw emotional depth, particularly tracks addressing her divorce, motherhood, and personal growth, though some noted production inconsistencies compared to her prior works.\n\nIn conjunction with *30*'s release, Adele announced her Las Vegas residency, *Weekends with Adele*, initially scheduled for January 21 to April 16, 2022, at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace, featuring two shows per weekend. The residency was postponed hours before its opening night in January 2022 due to production delays and crew illnesses amid the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to fan backlash and lawsuits, though Adele later apologized publicly. It commenced on November 18, 2022, and was extended multiple times, adding 32 dates in October 2023 to run through June 2024, ultimately concluding on November 23, 2024, after over 100 performances. The shows emphasized intimate, soulful renditions of her catalog, with high ticket demand reflecting her enduring popularity.\n\nIn September 2024, during her final Las Vegas shows, Adele announced an indefinite hiatus from music and performing, stating, \"I will not see you for an incredibly long time,\" following the residency's end and a brief Munich stint, citing exhaustion from three years of touring and a desire for personal rest. As of 2025, no new music or tour dates have been confirmed, aligning with her stated intention for an extended break.\n\n## Artistry\n\n### Influences and Songwriting Approach\n\nAdele has frequently cited soul, R\\u0026B, and blues artists from previous generations as formative influences on her vocal delivery and emotional intensity. In a 2015 interview, she highlighted Etta James for embodying a raw power that \"puts fire in my soul,\" a quality she emulates in her phrasing and timbre. Similarly, Amy Winehouse's blend of jazz-inflected soul and confessional lyricism has shaped Adele's approach, most overtly on her 2021 album *30*, where Winehouse's stylistic markers—such as horn sections and retro production—reappear amid themes of relational strife. Other pivotal figures include Lauryn Hill, whose 1998 album *The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill* Adele described as \"life-defining\" for its narrative depth, and contemporaries like Mary J. Blige and Alicia Keys, whose works reinforced her affinity for heartfelt balladry.\n\nAdele's songwriting process centers on autobiographical catharsis, prioritizing emotional authenticity over commercial calculation. She has explained that her lyrics often originate from \"drunk diary entries\" capturing immediate heartbreak, which her hand transcribes almost involuntarily as a form of self-therapy, transforming personal turmoil into structured songs without initial concern for market appeal. This method yields material she tests for efficacy by its capacity to evoke tears during composition, signaling resonance with her own experiences—a benchmark she applies to ensure the work's sincerity before refining it collaboratively. In sessions with producers like Greg Kurstin, the focus shifts to musical ignition: Kurstin experiments with chord progressions until one sparks Adele's lyrical flow, underscoring a reactive, intuition-driven workflow rather than premeditated formulas. For *25* (2015), she characterized the endeavor as her \"hardest process,\" grappling with post-motherhood introspection to balance vulnerability with restraint, yet yielding tracks like \"Hello\" from unfiltered relational reckoning. This approach consistently favors raw narrative over abstraction, drawing listeners into specific relational dynamics while avoiding broader sociopolitical commentary.\n\n### Musical Style and Production\n\nAdele's musical style primarily encompasses soul, pop, and R\\u0026B genres, featuring emotional ballads that emphasize personal lyrics delivered through powerful, heartfelt vocals.  Her songs often blend blues and soul elements with pop structures, prioritizing raw emotional expression over elaborate production, as seen in tracks that highlight vulnerability and authenticity in her delivery. \n\nHer vocal technique stands out for its smoky alto range, combining soulful power with tenderness and emotional transparency, which allows for subtle intensity in verses building to belted choruses.  Influences from artists like Etta James and Amy Winehouse inform her approach, incorporating gospel-tinged phrasing and bluesy inflections, though Adele leans more toward pop-blues-country hybrids compared to Winehouse's jazz-neo soul focus. \n\nIn production, Adele collaborates with producers such as Paul Epworth, who co-wrote and produced \"Rolling in the Deep\" from her 2011 album *21*, employing live instrumentation and dynamic builds to underscore her voice without overpowering it.  Fraser T Smith handled \"Set Fire to the Rain,\" using orchestral swells and rhythmic drives typical of power ballads to enhance emotional peaks. Rick Rubin's minimalist philosophy influenced *21*, stripping arrangements to focus on Adele's raw performances recorded in analog fashion. Later works like *25* (2015) involved mixers such as Tom Elmhirst, who balanced her vocals with subtle electronic and organic layers for a polished yet intimate sound. Across albums, production favors piano-driven foundations, string sections, and restraint in effects to preserve the primacy of lyrical content and vocal timbre.\n\n### Vocal Technique and Performance\n\nAdele possesses a mezzo-soprano vocal classification, characterized by a dark timbre and a range spanning approximately three octaves from C3 to C6. Her voice features a robust chest register that enables powerful belting, particularly effective in delivering emotional peaks in songs like \"Rolling in the Deep,\" where she projects with chest-dominant resonance up to E5 or higher. This belting technique relies on heavy vocal weight for intensity, contributing to her signature forceful delivery, though it often involves straining beyond optimal diaphragmatic support.\n\nIn performance, Adele emphasizes emotional authenticity over technical agility, employing a breathy head voice for fragility alongside gritty growls and soulful inflections derived from influences like Etta James. Her midrange exhibits a sweet, lyrical quality with controlled vibrato, allowing nuanced phrasing in ballads such as \"Someone Like You.\" Live renditions showcase depth in lower notes (down to B2) and consistent power, but inconsistencies arise, including occasional pitch instability and flatness, attributed by vocal analysts to throaty tension rather than full breath support.\n\nCritiques of her technique highlight risks from improper upper belt production, which uses throat constriction to achieve resonance, leading to vocal cord strain and documented health issues like a 2017 hemorrhage requiring surgery. Despite these, her live shows demonstrate resilience, with adaptations like reduced touring post-surgery to preserve longevity, and effective use of consonants for expressive clarity in recent performances. Vocal coaches note that while her emotive style captivates audiences, over-reliance on belting without refined mixed voice contributes to fatigue, contrasting with more versatile contemporaries.\n\n## Personal Life\n\n### Relationships and Engagements\n\nAdele began dating Simon Konecki, a British marketing executive involved in charitable work, in early 2011 after meeting through mutual friends in the philanthropy sector. The couple welcomed their son, Angelo James, on October 19, 2012. Adele publicly referred to Konecki as her husband during her acceptance speech at the 59th Grammy Awards on February 12, 2017, though she later clarified in a 2021 *Vogue* interview that they had married secretly in 2018 to avoid media scrutiny. The marriage lasted less than two years publicly, with Adele and Konecki announcing their separation on April 19, 2019, citing amicable differences after more than seven years together; their divorce was finalized on March 4, 2021, with joint custody of their son.\n\nIn the years following her divorce, Adele was briefly linked to British rapper Skepta in 2019 and 2020, with reports of flirtatious social media interactions and sightings together, though neither confirmed a formal relationship. She began dating sports agent Rich Paul in mid-2021, having first met him in early 2021 when she sought advice on acquiring a basketball team; their connection developed through shared social circles including LeBron James. The couple made their relationship Instagram-official on September 19, 2021, with Adele posting a photo of them courtside at an NBA game. Adele confirmed their engagement on August 9, 2024, during a performance in Munich, Germany, where she displayed a diamond ring and told the audience, \"I did get engaged,\" prompting cheers from the crowd. As of 2025, Adele and Paul remain engaged, with no reports of marriage.\n\n### Motherhood and Family Dynamics\n\nAdele gave birth to her son, Angelo Adkins, on October 19, 2012, with her then-partner Simon Konecki, marking her entry into motherhood at age 24. She has maintained strict privacy regarding Angelo, successfully suing media outlets for publishing unauthorized images of him to protect his well-being from public scrutiny. In early interviews, Adele described motherhood as \"hard but phenomenal,\" highlighting the profound personal growth it induced while acknowledging the challenges of balancing it with her career demands.\n\nPostpartum experiences included struggles with depression, which Adele later reflected upon as influencing her self-perception as a parent and reshaping her views on her own mother's child-rearing decisions. She paused professional activities following Angelo's birth to prioritize parenting, expressing in 2015 that the role fundamentally altered her priorities and emotional outlook.\n\nAdele's relationship with Konecki, with whom she secretly married in 2018, ended in separation announced on April 19, 2019, followed by divorce finalized in 2021; the couple maintains an amicable co-parenting arrangement for Angelo, with Konecki residing nearby to facilitate joint involvement. The divorce profoundly affected Angelo, then aged 6 at announcement, prompting Adele to incorporate voice notes of their discussions into tracks on her 2021 album *30* to process and explain the changes, as she believed staying in an unhappy marriage would model unhealthy dynamics for him. Adele has voiced ongoing guilt over Angelo's emotional distress, including his questioning of her earlier promises of family unity, yet asserted that prioritizing personal authenticity benefited long-term family stability over superficial cohesion.\n\nIn subsequent reflections, Adele has expressed aspirations for additional children, citing motherhood's transformative rewards despite its trials, and emphasized co-parenting's role in mitigating divorce's fallout on Angelo.\n\n### Health Issues and Physical Transformations\n\nAdele underwent microsurgery in October 2011 at Massachusetts General Hospital to remove a benign polyp on her vocal cord, which had caused recurrent hemorrhaging and necessitated the cancellation of tour dates.  The procedure addressed damage from intensive vocal use during her early career, allowing recovery after months of vocal rest.\n\nShe has experienced chronic back pain, including slipped discs predating her weight loss, and a diagnosis of sciatica, a condition involving nerve compression leading to leg and back pain.  In August 2023, during her Las Vegas residency, Adele collapsed backstage from a sciatica flare-up, requiring assistance to stand before performing.\n\nAdele has discussed mental health challenges, including postpartum depression following the 2012 birth of her son, characterized by persistent sadness and disconnection from her pre-motherhood identity. Post-2019 divorce, she reported severe anxiety episodes, including weeks of being bed-bound, which prompted renewed therapy.\n\nBeginning around 2019, Adele achieved a significant physical transformation, losing approximately 100 pounds over two years through rigorous exercise rather than restrictive dieting. Her routine, guided by trainer Pete Geracimo, emphasized weightlifting, circuit training, and cardio—up to three sessions daily—to build strength, particularly in her core and lower body.  Initially motivated by anxiety management rather than aesthetics, the regimen improved her mental clarity and alleviated back pain by stabilizing slipped discs.  Adele has denied rumors of surgical interventions like liposuction, attributing changes solely to sustained physical activity. The transformation, visible publicly by late 2020, enhanced her endurance for performances but sparked debates on body image, which she described as overlooking deeper health benefits.\n\n## Controversies\n\n### Concert Cancellations and Fan Relations\n\nAdele has experienced multiple concert cancellations primarily attributed to vocal health complications. In October 2011, she canceled the remaining dates of her North American tour after suffering a vocal cord hemorrhage, described by her as akin to a \"black eye\" on the cords, necessitating surgery and extended recovery. In June 2017, she axed the final two Wembley Stadium performances of her world tour due to damaged vocal cords from prior strain, following earlier throat surgery in 2011. These incidents stemmed from the physical demands of her emotive singing style, which exerts significant pressure on her vocal apparatus.\n\nThe most publicized cancellation occurred with her \"Weekends with Adele\" Las Vegas residency at Caesars Palace's Colosseum, originally set to begin on January 21, 2022, for 24 dates through April. Adele postponed the entire run hours before the opener, citing production delays exacerbated by COVID-19 infections among her crew, though she later elaborated that the stage setup felt \"disconnected\" and lacked \"soul,\" rendering it unsuitable for performance. She rescheduled the residency to start in November 2022, completing it successfully by March 2024, but described the initial decision as the \"worst moment\" of her career, leading to personal embarrassment and withdrawal. In February 2024, she again postponed 10 March residency dates due to illness impacting her voice, rescheduling them for October and November.\n\nThese cancellations strained fan relations, eliciting widespread backlash over financial and logistical hardships. For the 2022 postponement, ticket holders faced non-refundable travel costs, with some discovering the news mid-flight to Las Vegas or after arriving, prompting demands for compensation beyond ticket refunds, which were delayed until rescheduling. Fans criticized the late notice and questioned the cited reasons, including unverified claims of venue disputes over stage alterations like seat colors and historical photos. The 2024 postponement renewed frustrations, with one fan reporting cumulative losses nearing $5,000 from repeated disruptions. Adele addressed affected audiences directly in January 2023, apologizing for the inconvenience during a rescheduled performance. While no formal lawsuits materialized in public records, the episodes highlighted tensions between her health necessities and fan expectations for reliability amid high-stakes ticket pricing.\n\n### Accusations of Cultural Appropriation\n\nIn August 2020, Adele shared an Instagram post featuring herself in Bantu knots—a hairstyle with roots in traditional African coiling techniques used for protection and styling among Black communities—and a bikini top displaying the colors of the Jamaican flag, captioned as a nod to the canceled Notting Hill Carnival amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The post, intended to celebrate the event's Caribbean heritage, drew immediate backlash from portions of social media and online commentators who labeled it cultural appropriation, contending that Adele, as a white British artist, was adopting elements of marginalized Black cultures for aesthetic purposes without enduring the associated historical discrimination or lived experience. Critics, including some vocal on platforms like Twitter, argued the combination trivialized sacred cultural symbols, particularly given Adele's non-Caribbean background, though the accusations amplified through outlets with progressive leanings that often frame such acts through lenses of power imbalances.\n\nAdele did not remove the post and later reflected on the uproar in an October 2021 British Vogue interview, acknowledging she \"didn't read the f--king room\" but clarifying her intent was rooted in genuine affinity for Notting Hill Carnival—a London event founded in 1966 by Trinidadian immigrants Claudia Jones and others to foster West Indian community amid racial tensions—rather than mockery or commodification. She emphasized the hairstyle's personal significance to her Carnival celebrations and rejected deleting it, viewing the criticism as part of broader scrutiny of her body image post-weight loss, while maintaining respect for the cultures involved.\n\nCounterarguments highlighted the fluidity of cultural exchange in multicultural Britain, where Notting Hill Carnival has evolved as a public festival drawing over a million participants annually, blending African, Caribbean, and European elements without strict gatekeeping; supporters, including broadcaster Afua Adom, contended Adele's look exemplified appreciation from a longtime attendee of the event, not exploitation, especially since Bantu knots have been adapted globally and Carnival itself promotes inclusive revelry. The debate underscored divisions over appropriation's definition, with some viewing accusations as overreach in policing personal expression within shared civic traditions, while others prioritized protecting cultural origins from dilution by dominant-group figures. No formal repercussions followed, and the incident remained a isolated social media storm rather than a sustained career detriment.\n\n### Criticisms of Artistic Choices and Public Persona\n\nAdele's adherence to a stylistic formula of soul-influenced ballads focused on romantic turmoil and emotional catharsis has drawn rebukes for stagnation, with critics arguing it prioritizes commercial reliability over artistic risk-taking. For instance, reviews of her 2015 album *25* highlighted its dependence on established tropes without substantial sonic diversification, despite strong sales exceeding 23 million copies worldwide. Her 2021 release *30* similarly faced observations of repetition, with one assessment noting it echoes prior works to the point of feeling like an extension rather than progression, potentially alienating listeners seeking broader experimentation. Adele addressed such feedback by defending her method, remarking in 2021 that altering a proven framework would be unnecessary given its efficacy.\n\nHer songwriting choices, often co-authored with producers like Greg Kurstin, have been faulted for leaning into confessional excess, exemplified by tracks incorporating personal voicemails and familial elements, such as \"My Little Love\" on *30*, where her young son voices concerns about her distress. Detractors contend this blurs boundaries between art and therapy, yielding output perceived as navel-gazing rather than universally resonant, particularly amid her net worth surpassing £170 million by 2021.\n\nRegarding public persona, Adele's emphasis on raw vulnerability—frequently conveyed through tearful interviews and onstage candor—has been characterized by some as contrived narcissism, with commentator Julie Burchill in 2024 labeling it \"luxury grief\" unfit for a performer of her stature, who has canceled residencies citing vocal strain yet maintains a grueling emotional narrative. This image of perpetual melancholy, rooted in disclosures of anxiety, divorce, and relational strife, contrasts with her professional triumphs, prompting accusations of ingratitude toward fans and industry enablers.\n\nA notable flashpoint emerged with her circa-2020 weight loss of roughly 100 pounds, which some activists and online commentators decried as capitulation to societal pressures, eroding her prior role as an emblem of non-conformist body representation that resonated with plus-size audiences. Critics argued the transformation invalidated prior empowerment narratives, fostering resentment among those who viewed her fuller physique as integral to her authentic appeal, though Adele attributed the change to exercise for mental health amid personal upheaval, rejecting any obligation to sustain others' ideals.\n\n## Public Engagement\n\n### Political Statements and Positions\n\nAdele has identified as a supporter of the UK's Labour Party, describing herself in 2011 as a \"Labour girl through and through\" in response to the Conservative Party auctioning tickets to her concerts for fundraising purposes. In June 2017, ahead of the UK general election, she posted on her official Facebook page urging followers to \"Vote x,\" emphasizing the importance of participation without explicitly naming parties, though the context opposed the incumbent Conservative government led by Theresa May.\n\nRegarding international politics, Adele opposed Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, issuing a statement through her representatives that no permission had been granted for its use of her music, such as \"Rolling in the Deep,\" at rallies. During a concert in Miami on October 25, 2016, she told the audience she was \"100 percent\" behind Hillary Clinton and explicitly urged fans, \"Please don't vote for him,\" referring to Trump. She also expressed embarrassment for American audiences over the U.S. presidential debates involving Trump, commenting during a performance that she felt sympathy for viewers amid the discourse.\n\nOn the 2016 Brexit referendum, Adele voiced concern post-vote during her Glastonbury Festival headline set on June 26, 2016, stating, \"It's a bit weird the stuff that's going on at the moment for all of us,\" and adding, \"And we need to look after each other,\" in allusion to the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union. Her remarks reflected unease with the outcome, aligning with broader sentiments among some British cultural figures favoring Remain.\n\nAdele has publicly embraced feminism, affirming in a 2015 *Rolling Stone* interview, \"I'm a feminist. I believe that everyone should be treated the same, including race and sexuality,\" while critiquing industry sexism faced by female artists compared to males. She has occasionally highlighted gender-specific experiences, such as in her 2022 BRIT Awards speech where she stated, \"I love being a woman,\" prompting discussions on her views amid evolving cultural debates on gender.\n\n### Philanthropic Efforts and Charitable Giving\n\nAdele has engaged in philanthropy primarily through targeted support for causes related to child welfare, neonatal loss, and community recovery efforts, often leveraging her platform during tours and performances to encourage donations. During her 2011 world tour, she stipulated that recipients of complimentary tickets donate $20 to Sands, a UK-based charity aiding families affected by stillbirth and neonatal death. In 2016, ahead of her UK tour dates, she donated pairs of sold-out tickets to Great Ormond Street Hospital Children's Charity, allowing fans to enter a prize draw by contributing £10 per entry to support pediatric care.\n\nFollowing the June 2017 Grenfell Tower fire in London, which killed 72 people, Adele visited affected families shortly after the incident, providing emotional support including hugs and baked goods to survivors and victims' relatives. She dedicated her June 28, 2017, Wembley Stadium concert to the Grenfell community, announcing proceeds would aid recovery efforts, and has since marked anniversaries by publicly honoring survivors and calling for accountability through retweets and video messages for Grenfell United.\n\nAdele has also contributed to music industry support via MusiCares, participating in events to assist musicians with financial and health challenges. In a 2023 interview, she emphasized conducting much of her charitable work anonymously to avoid influencing recipients' perceptions of her motives. Her efforts reflect a pattern of low-profile, direct involvement rather than high-visibility campaigns, with documented ties to organizations like Amnesty International and Keep A Child Alive through awareness and event participation.\n\n## Wealth and Commercial Ventures\n\n### Earnings from Music and Performances\n\nAdele's earnings from her music releases have primarily stemmed from album sales and royalties, with her breakthrough album *21* (2011) achieving over 30.4 million pure sales worldwide, forming a substantial portion of her revenue through publishing and recording royalties. The follow-up *25* (2015) generated an estimated $76-79 million in artist royalties from its initial sales alone, bolstered by first-week figures exceeding 3.3 million units in the US. Overall, from 2009 to 2019, her record sales contributed to more than $400 million in pretax earnings, underscoring the dominance of physical and digital album purchases in her income stream during that period.\n\nHer concert tours have provided additional high-margin revenue, with the Adele Live 2016 tour—supporting *25*—grossing $278.4 million from 2.48 million tickets sold across 120 shows, marking one of the highest-grossing tours by a solo artist in that era. This performance helped propel her to third on Forbes' 2016 list of highest-paid musicians, with $80.5 million in pretax earnings largely from album sales augmented by tour proceeds averaging millions per night. The tour's success reflected strong demand for live performances of her emotive ballads, though Adele's personal take-home varied after promoter cuts and production costs, estimated to yield tens of millions in net profit.\n\nResidency engagements have further diversified her performance income, particularly the Weekends with Adele series at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas from 2022 to 2024, where each of the over 100 shows reportedly grossed approximately $2 million. These residencies, combined with a brief Munich run in 2024, contributed to daily earnings averaging £21,500 in the latter year, enhancing her wealth through consistent, lower-overhead live revenue compared to global tours. Career-wide, Adele's tours and residencies have generated over $1.14 billion in total gross ticket sales from nearly 4 million tickets, with her share reflecting strategic pricing and sold-out venues. Streaming royalties continue as a steady supplement, estimated at $60,000 per day.\n\n### Business Decisions and Investments\n\nAdele has managed her career through personal holding companies, including Melted Stone Ltd, which reported cash reserves of $18 million as of 2021, reflecting prudent financial oversight of royalties and assets following her album releases. This structure allows her to retain significant control over publishing rights and ancillary revenues from song ownership, contributing to diversified income streams beyond initial sales.\n\nIn 2025, Adele invested in Audoo, a technology platform aimed at ensuring fairer royalty payments for musicians through improved data tracking in streaming services, as part of a £7 million funding round. This move aligns with her interests in the music industry's economic mechanics, extending her influence into tech solutions for artist compensation without direct involvement in operations. Her broader tech investments remain selective, focusing on sectors that support creative professions.\n\nReal estate forms a core component of Adele's investment strategy, with a portfolio exceeding $30 million in Beverly Hills properties acquired between 2019 and 2021, including a $10.65 million home and adjacent estates for privacy and appreciation potential.  Earlier purchases, such as London townhouses, further demonstrate a pattern of leveraging high-value assets for long-term wealth preservation amid fluctuating music revenues.\n\nIn November 2023, Adele incorporated The Shelbourne Collective Limited, securing trademarks that suggest expansion into beauty or consumer products, marking a diversification beyond music into branded ventures.  This entity, filed via UK Companies House, positions her to capitalize on personal branding in lifestyle sectors. Additionally, in 2024, she declined a $200 million offer to extend her Las Vegas residency, prioritizing health and family over immediate financial gains, a decision consistent with her history of tour aversion.\n\n## Legacy and Reception\n\n### Critical Analysis and Artistic Impact\n\nAdele's vocal prowess centers on a mezzo-soprano range spanning from B2 to A5, marked by powerful belting and a soulful mid-register that conveys raw emotion through subtle vibrato and dynamic control. While praised for its authenticity and fragility, enabling intimate storytelling, her technique has drawn scrutiny for relying on strained, throaty projections that risk vocal damage, producing a raspy timbre some attribute to improper resonance rather than stylistic choice. This approach, rooted in bluesy inflections reminiscent of Etta James and Amy Winehouse, prioritizes expressive grit over polished precision, fostering a perception of unfiltered vulnerability that resonates broadly despite technical imperfections.\n\nHer songwriting, often collaborative, emphasizes confessional narratives of love, loss, and resilience, employing straightforward lyrics and chord progressions that amplify emotional directness over lyrical innovation or structural complexity. Critics have faulted this for yielding generic ballads with predictable builds and \"cheesy\" production elements, such as orchestral swells and repetitive hooks, which prioritize commercial appeal and relatability—drawing from universal heartbreak—over genre experimentation or sonic risk-taking. Nonetheless, this formula has proven effective in capturing generational sentiments, as evidenced by the sustained chart dominance of albums like *21* and *25*, where production by figures like Paul Epworth enhances rather than overshadows her voice.\n\nArtistically, Adele has reinvigorated soul-infused pop ballads in the digital era, bridging retro influences like Winehouse's jazz-soul hybrid with contemporary accessibility, thereby influencing a wave of vocal-centric artists including Sam Smith, Lewis Capaldi, and elements in Billie Eilish's introspective style. Her emphasis on substantive vocal delivery amid visual-saturated pop culture underscores a causal link between authentic emotional conveyance and listener connection, challenging ephemeral trends and affirming the enduring power of melody-driven storytelling. This impact manifests in heightened appreciation for \"torch songs,\" where her unadorned persona—eschewing endorsements or image curation—reinforces music's primacy as an auditory, not performative, medium. Despite debates over stylistic borrowing from Black musical traditions, her white British lens adapts these elements into mainstream vehicles that prioritize universality, evidenced by global sales exceeding 120 million records by 2021.\n\n### Commercial Success and Cultural Phenomenon\n\nAdele's second album, *21*, released in January 2011, achieved unprecedented commercial dominance, selling over 31 million copies worldwide and accumulating 55.9 million equivalent album units, making it her best-selling release. The album's lead single, \"Rolling in the Deep,\" and tracks like \"Someone Like You\" drove its success, with *21* topping charts in over 30 countries and holding the top spot on the Billboard 200 for 24 non-consecutive weeks. This performance revitalized interest in album sales during a period dominated by digital streaming, contributing to broader industry growth.\n\nHer third album, *25*, released on November 20, 2015, shattered first-week sales records with 5.706 million units globally, including 3.38 million in the United States alone, marking the largest debut week for any album in the 21st century at the time. The single \"Hello\" amplified this, becoming a chart-topping hit that exemplified her signature blend of soulful vocals and personal storytelling. *25* ultimately sold 22 million pure copies, underscoring sustained demand for her work.\n\nAdele's overall catalog has generated 119.6 million equivalent album sales worldwide, positioning her as one of the most successful artists of the modern era. Her tours, including the record-breaking Wembley Stadium residency in 2017 and the 2024 Munich shows—which set a Guinness World Record for the largest temporary outdoor LED screen at 4,159.7 square meters—further amplified her commercial reach, with the latter generating an estimated £100 million in revenue. In 2011, she broke eight Guinness World Records simultaneously, including milestones for digital downloads and video views.\n\nAs a cultural phenomenon, Adele's rise highlighted a demand for authentic, emotionally resonant music amid prevalent auto-tuned pop, with *21* influencing a resurgence in heartfelt balladry and boosting U.S. album sales by 6.3% in 2015. Her unpolished persona and vocal prowess resonated globally, fostering a \"Adele effect\" where her releases drove spikes in physical and digital consumption, as evidenced by *21*'s certification as the highest RIAA multi-platinum album of the 21st century at 17 times platinum. This impact extended beyond metrics, redefining commercial viability for traditional songcraft in a fragmented market.\n\n### Awards and Recognitions\n\nAdele has amassed 16 Grammy Awards from 25 nominations, establishing her as one of the most awarded artists in the ceremony's history. Her debut wins came at the 51st Annual Grammy Awards on February 8, 2009, for Best New Artist and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for \"Chasing Pavements.\" At the 54th Annual Grammy Awards on February 12, 2012, she achieved a historic sweep by winning all six categories for which she was nominated related to her album *21*, including Album of the Year, Record of the Year (\"Rolling in the Deep\"), Song of the Year (\"Rolling in the Deep\"), and Best Pop Vocal Album. She repeated her Album of the Year success at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards on February 12, 2017, for *25*, marking her as the first British artist to win the award twice; during the ceremony, she shared the honor with Beyoncé's *Lemonade* in an emotional gesture but retained the award. For her 2021 album *30*, Adele secured additional wins including Best Pop Vocal Album at the 65th Annual Grammy Awards on February 5, 2023, along with Best Pop Solo Performance for \"Easy on Me.\"\n\nIn the United Kingdom, Adele holds 12 Brit Awards, the most for any artist, including three British Album of the Year honors for *19* (2008), *21* (2012), and *30* (2022). At the 2022 Brit Awards on February 8, she won Artist of the Year, British Album (*30*), and Song of the Year (\"Easy on Me\"), performing \"I Drink Wine\" during the event. Her Brit Award triumphs underscore her dominance in British music accolades, with early recognition including British Breakthrough Act and British Female Solo Artist in 2008.\n\nAdele's contributions to film soundtracks earned her an Academy Award for Best Original Song for \"Skyfall\" from the James Bond film of the same name, awarded on February 24, 2013; she also received the corresponding Golden Globe on January 13, 2013. Additionally, she won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety Special (Pre-Recorded) for *Adele: One Night Only* on September 3, 2022. Other notable recognitions include 18 Billboard Music Awards and multiple American Music Awards, reflecting her commercial impact. These honors, drawn from industry-voted and sales-based metrics, affirm her critical and popular acclaim, though some analyses note the subjective nature of artistic judging in bodies like the Recording Academy.\n\n## Works\n\n### Discography\n\nAdele's discography primarily comprises four studio albums released via XL Recordings, each achieving number one status on the UK Albums Chart, a record for a female artist. These albums have garnered substantial commercial success, with certified sales exceeding tens of millions in the United States alone according to RIAA data. Her debut, *19* (2008), introduced her soul-influenced pop sound, peaking at number one in the UK for one week and number four on the US Billboard 200. The follow-up, *21* (2011), became a global phenomenon, topping the UK chart for 23 weeks and the US Billboard 200 for 24 weeks, with RIAA certification reaching 17× Platinum for over 17 million units shipped in the US, marking it the highest-certified album of the 21st century there. *25* (2015) set US first-week sales records at 3.38 million copies, while *30* (2021) debuted atop the UK chart for five weeks.\n\n| Title | Release date | UK peak | US peak (Billboard 200) | Selected certifications |\n|-------|--------------|---------|--------------------------|------------------------|\n| *19* | 28 January 2008 | 1 | 4 | US: Multi-Platinum (recent upgrades noted) |\n| *21* | 21 January 2011 | 1 | 1 | UK: Multi-Platinum (over 5 million); US: 17× Platinum |\n| *25* | 20 November 2015 | 1 | 1 | US: Diamond-equivalent (first-week sales 3.38 million) |\n| *30* | 19 November 2021 | 1 | 1 | UK: Multi-Platinum |\n\nAdele has released numerous singles, with 11 reaching the UK top 10 and three number ones: \"Someone Like You\" (five weeks at number one), \"Hello\" (three weeks), and \"Easy on Me\" (eight weeks). \"Rolling in the Deep\" peaked at number two in the UK and topped the US Hot 100, contributing to *21*'s dominance. Other notable singles include \"Set Fire to the Rain,\" \"Skyfall\" (James Bond theme, UK number two), and \"Chasing Pavements\" from *19*. She has no compilation albums but released the live album *Live at the Royal Albert Hall* in 2011, certified platinum in the UK.\n\n### Filmography and Soundtracks\n\nAdele's filmography consists primarily of self-appearances in music-related documentaries and concert films, alongside her musical contributions to feature film soundtracks. She appeared as herself in the 2012 concert documentary *Katy Perry: Part of Me*, providing insights into the music industry during an interview segment.\n\nHer primary cinematic output includes the 2011 concert film *Adele: Live at the Royal Albert Hall*, directed by Paul Dugdale, which captures her performance on September 30, 2011, featuring songs from her album *21* along with covers and guest artists like her choir. The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray, topping charts in multiple countries.\n\nThe 2015 special *Adele Live in New York City*, filmed at Radio City Music Hall on November 17 during her *25* tour promotion, aired on NBC on December 14 and received four Emmy nominations, including for Outstanding Variety Special. Although broadcast as a television event, it functions as a documented live performance akin to a concert film.\n\nIn terms of soundtracks, Adele's most significant contribution is the theme song \"Skyfall\" for the 2012 James Bond film *Skyfall*, co-written with Paul Epworth; the track debuted at number 8 on the Billboard Hot 100 and won the Academy Award for Best Original Song at the 85th ceremony on February 24, 2013, as well as the Golden Globe.\n\nHer music has also been featured in other films, including soundtrack credits for *I Am Number Four* (2011) and *The 5th Wave* (2016), where songs from her catalog enhanced key scenes.\n\n| Year | Film Title          | Contribution                  |\n|------|---------------------|-------------------------------|\n| 2011 | I Am Number Four   | Soundtrack performer         |\n| 2012 | Skyfall            | Theme song performer and writer (Oscar winner) |\n| 2016 | The 5th Wave       | Soundtrack performer         |\n\n### Concert Tours and Residencies\n\nAdele's debut concert tour, titled An Evening with Adele, promoted her first studio album *19* and consisted of 78 shows, with 30 performances in Europe from January 2008 to July 2009 and 48 in North America during spring 2009. Following the vocal cord surgery that halted live performances after the release of her second album *21* in 2011, Adele conducted limited promotional appearances, including a residency of four shows at the Royal Albert Hall in September 2011, but no extensive tour. Wait, no wiki.\n\nNo, avoid.\n\nAdjust.\n\nHer second major tour, Adele Live 2016, supported the album *25* and commenced on February 29, 2016, in Belfast, Northern Ireland, before proceeding through Europe and North America, concluding in June 2017. The tour grossed $278.4 million from the sale of over 2.4 million tickets across 120 shows, ranking it among the highest-earning tours of its era.\n\nIn lieu of a traditional world tour for her fourth album *30*, Adele launched the Weekends with Adele residency at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, originally scheduled for January to April 2022 but postponed due to production issues and rescheduled to begin November 18, 2022, extending through November 23, 2024, for a total of 100 performances. The residency generated over $200 million in gross revenue, with estimates of $1.75 million to $2 million per show.\n\nIn August and September 2024, Adele performed 10 consecutive shows at Munich's Olympiastadion, marketed as a special European engagement, which set attendance records for the venue and contributed an estimated economic impact of 540 million euros to the city. These performances, while not formally designated a residency, echoed the fixed-venue format of her Las Vegas run and drew over 750,000 attendees.",
