# Cancer

Cancer is a group of diseases characterized by the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells in the body, which can invade nearby tissues and metastasize to distant sites. These malignant cells differ from normal cells by ignoring growth signals, evading programmed cell death, and forming new blood vessels to sustain their proliferation. If left untreated, cancer can lead to severe health complications and death, making it one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide.

Globally, cancer imposes a significant burden on health systems and populations. In 2022, an estimated 20 million new cases were diagnosed, resulting in 9.7 million deaths, with projections indicating a 77% increase in the cancer burden by 2050 due to population growth, aging, and lifestyle factors. In the United States alone, approximately 2,041,910 new cases and 618,120 deaths are expected in 2025, with breast, prostate, lung, and colorectal cancers among the most common types. There are over 100 distinct types of cancer, broadly classified by the tissue of origin—such as carcinomas (from epithelial cells), sarcomas (from connective tissues), leukemias (from blood-forming tissues), and lymphomas (from the immune system)—with carcinomas accounting for about 80-90% of cases. 

Cancer arises from genetic mutations that disrupt normal cell regulation, often triggered by a combination of inherited predispositions, environmental exposures (like tobacco smoke, ultraviolet radiation, and certain chemicals), and lifestyle factors (including diet, physical inactivity, and alcohol consumption). Benign tumors, in contrast, do not invade or spread and are generally non-life-threatening, whereas malignant tumors exhibit aggressive behavior and require intervention. Diagnosis typically involves staging, from localized (stages I-II) to advanced metastatic disease (stage IV), guiding treatment options such as surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, immunotherapy, and targeted therapies, which have improved survival rates over time. Prevention strategies, including vaccination against cancer-causing viruses (e.g., HPV for cervical cancer) and screening programs, play a crucial role in reducing incidence and enabling early detection.

## Background

### Etymology

The term "cancer" originates from the ancient Greek word *karkinos* (καρκίνος), meaning "crab," a term first applied to tumors by the physician Hippocrates around 400 BCE. Hippocrates and his followers used *karkinos* to describe non-ulcerated tumors and *karkinoma* for ulcerated ones, likening the swollen veins extending from the tumor to the legs of a crab grasping its prey.

This terminology evolved through Roman medicine when Aulus Cornelius Celsus, in the 1st century CE, translated the Greek *karkinos* directly into the Latin *cancer*, preserving the crab imagery in his medical encyclopedia *De Medicina*. Later, the Greek physician Galen in the 2nd century CE refined the distinction, employing *carcinoma* specifically for malignant growths that spread aggressively, while reserving *oncos* (meaning "swelling") for more general tumors and differentiating them from benign conditions.

In contemporary medical usage, "cancer" denotes a malignant neoplasm characterized by uncontrolled cell proliferation and potential metastasis, explicitly contrasting with benign tumors that do not invade surrounding tissues. This precise delineation emerged with advancements in pathology during the 19th century, solidifying the term's focus on malignancy over mere swelling or ulceration.

Etymologically, the word also names the zodiac sign Cancer, derived from the same Latin root, symbolizing the summer solstice in ancient astronomy. Beyond medicine, "cancer" has permeated literature and culture as a metaphor for insidious corruption or unrelenting destruction, as seen in works from early modern Europe where it evoked social or moral decay.

### Definitions

Cancer is a generic term for a large group of diseases characterized by the uncontrolled proliferation of abnormal cells that can invade adjacent tissues and metastasize to distant sites in the body. These malignant neoplasms arise from the transformation of normal cells into cancerous ones, leading to the formation of tumors or abnormal proliferations of cells that disrupt normal physiological functions. Unlike benign conditions, cancer's hallmark ability to spread distinguishes it as a potentially lethal disease if untreated.

Central to the biological behavior of cancer cells are acquired capabilities that enable their survival and proliferation, as outlined in the seminal framework of cancer hallmarks. These include autonomy from exogenous growth signals, allowing self-sustained proliferation; evasion of apoptosis, or programmed cell death; induction of sustained angiogenesis to ensure nutrient supply; and attainment of replicative immortality through mechanisms like telomere maintenance.81683-9) This framework, originally proposed in 2000 and updated in 2011 to incorporate emerging insights such as metabolic reprogramming and immune evasion, was further expanded in 2022 to include additional dimensions like unlocking phenotypic plasticity and influences from polymorphic microbiomes, providing a conceptual foundation for understanding cancer's core attributes across diverse types.

Cancer must be differentiated from non-malignant proliferative conditions to guide accurate diagnosis and management. Benign tumors consist of non-invasive cells that grow slowly, remain localized, and do not metastasize, posing risks primarily through mass effect rather than dissemination. In contrast, hyperplasia involves an increase in the number of normal-appearing cells due to excessive division, often reversible and non-neoplastic, while dysplasia features abnormal cellular maturation, architectural disorganization, and atypia, representing a precancerous state that may progress to malignancy if unchecked. These distinctions underscore cancer's unique malignant potential, rooted in genetic and epigenetic alterations that confer invasive properties.

Neoplastic diseases, encompassing both benign and malignant forms, are systematically classified for clinical, epidemiological, and research purposes. The World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Tumours series provides detailed, organ-specific histological and molecular criteria for tumor types, serving as the international standard for pathology-based diagnosis. Complementing this, the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11, Chapter 2: Neoplasms) categorizes neoplasms by behavior—malignant (primarily 2A00–2E0Z), in situ (integrated within malignant categories), benign (2E80–2F3Z), and uncertain or unknown (2D10–2E7Z and 2F00–2F9Z)—facilitating global health data standardization and coding for morbidity and mortality statistics (as of 2025). These systems ensure precise identification and tracking of cancer entities, supporting advances in precision medicine.

## Clinical Presentation

### Local Symptoms

Local symptoms of cancer refer to manifestations that arise directly from the presence and growth of the primary tumor at its original site, often resulting from mechanical effects such as compression of surrounding tissues, obstruction of nearby structures, or ulceration of the surface epithelium. These symptoms vary depending on the tumor's location and size but typically reflect the tumor's local impact rather than distant spread. For instance, in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas, well-localized pain at the primary site is a common early presentation due to the tumor mass exerting pressure on nerves and tissues.

Site-specific examples illustrate how primary tumors produce distinct local signs. In breast cancer, a common early symptom is a new lump or thickening in the breast tissue, often painless and firm, which may be accompanied by skin dimpling or nipple inversion as the tumor grows and distorts local anatomy. For melanoma, changes in existing moles or the appearance of new skin lesions, such as asymmetrical growths with irregular borders, varied colors, or evolving shapes (often summarized by the ABCDE criteria), signal the primary tumor's disruption of normal skin architecture. In colorectal cancer, rectal bleeding or blood in the stool arises from tumor ulceration or erosion into the intestinal mucosa, while changes in bowel habits like persistent diarrhea or constipation result from partial obstruction by the mass.

Mechanisms underlying these symptoms include the tumor's mass effect, which causes pain or functional impairment through compression; obstruction, leading to blockages in hollow organs; and ulceration, resulting in bleeding or irritation. In esophageal cancer, early local signs may be subtle, but as the tumor advances, it produces dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) due to luminal narrowing from the mass or mucosal invasion. Similarly, in lung cancer, a persistent cough often emerges early from irritation or partial airway obstruction by the primary bronchial tumor, potentially progressing to hemoptysis (coughing up blood) with ulceration.

Recognizing these non-specific yet persistent local changes is crucial for early detection, as they can mimic benign conditions but prompt timely investigation when enduring. For example, ongoing cough in lung cancer or unexplained rectal bleeding in colorectal cancer may indicate the primary tumor's presence before more severe obstruction develops. Early intervention based on such signs can improve outcomes by addressing the tumor at its primary site.

### Systemic Symptoms

Systemic symptoms in cancer arise from the disease's widespread effects on the body, often resulting from tumor-secreted factors, inflammatory responses, or metabolic disruptions rather than direct tumor invasion. These manifestations can precede or accompany local signs and may affect patients across various cancer types, signaling advanced disease or significant physiological burden.

Fatigue is one of the most prevalent systemic symptoms, reported in up to 90% of cancer patients, stemming from anemia, cytokine-mediated inflammation, or deconditioning due to the illness. It manifests as profound tiredness not relieved by rest and can impair daily functioning, with studies linking it to elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines like tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Weight loss, often as part of cancer cachexia syndrome, affects approximately 80% of patients with advanced malignancies and involves involuntary loss of more than 5% of body weight over six months, driven by increased metabolic rate and appetite suppression via factors such as proteolysis-inducing factor (PIF). Cachexia contributes to muscle wasting and weakness, worsening prognosis, as evidenced by research showing it independently predicts mortality in lung and pancreatic cancers. Fever and night sweats, known as B symptoms in lymphomas, occur in about 20-30% of cases and result from tumor-induced pyrogenic cytokines or tumor necrosis, with interleukin-1 (IL-1) and IL-6 playing key roles in hypothalamic temperature regulation.

Paraneoplastic syndromes represent remote effects of cancer mediated by humoral or immune mechanisms, occurring in 10-20% of patients and often preceding tumor diagnosis. Hypercalcemia, induced by parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) secretion from tumors like squamous cell carcinomas, affects up to 30% of patients with solid tumors and leads to symptoms such as nausea, confusion, and polyuria due to elevated serum calcium levels above 10.5 mg/dL. Cushing's syndrome from ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) production, seen in small cell lung cancer in about 2-5% of cases, causes hypertension, hyperglycemia, and muscle weakness through cortisol excess. These syndromes highlight cancer's ability to disrupt endocrine balance without direct metastasis.

Anemia complicates 30-90% of cancer cases depending on the type, arising from bone marrow infiltration by tumor cells, chemotherapy effects, or chronic inflammation suppressing erythropoiesis. In chronic disease anemia, hepcidin upregulation inhibits iron availability, leading to normocytic anemia with hemoglobin levels below 12 g/dL in women and 13 g/dL in men, exacerbating fatigue and dyspnea. This is particularly common in inflammatory cancers like multiple myeloma, where it correlates with disease stage and survival.

Underlying many systemic symptoms is the release of cytokines from tumor cells and the host immune response, with IL-6 promoting cachexia and fever by activating the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway in muscle and liver tissues. This inflammatory milieu fosters a catabolic state, reducing appetite and increasing energy expenditure, as demonstrated in preclinical models of colon cancer where IL-6 blockade ameliorated weight loss.

### Metastatic Manifestations

Metastatic manifestations refer to the clinical symptoms and signs that arise when cancer cells spread from the primary tumor to distant organs or tissues, forming secondary tumors that disrupt normal function. These effects are distinct from local or systemic symptoms of the primary cancer and often indicate advanced disease stage IV. Common metastatic sites include the bones, liver, lungs, and brain, where the presence of secondary tumors can lead to organ-specific complaints.

In skeletal metastases, which frequently occur in cancers such as breast, prostate, and lung, patients commonly experience persistent bone pain, often described as deep and aching, localized to the affected area like the back or hips. This pain results from tumor invasion of bone tissue, periosteal stretching, or microfractures, and may worsen at night or with movement. Fractures can occur spontaneously due to weakened bone structure, leading to sudden severe pain and mobility issues.

Liver involvement, a frequent site for colorectal, breast, and pancreatic cancers, manifests as jaundice—a yellowing of the skin and eyes—due to biliary obstruction from tumor compression or invasion. Abdominal swelling or bloating may accompany this, along with early satiety and weight loss, as secondary tumors impair liver function and cause ascites from portal vein obstruction.

Brain metastases, common in lung, breast, and melanoma cases, produce neurological deficits such as headaches, seizures, confusion, or focal weaknesses, stemming from increased intracranial pressure or direct compression of brain tissue by growing tumors. These symptoms can progress rapidly, affecting balance, vision, or cognition.

Pulmonary metastases, often from primary tumors in the breast, colon, or kidney, lead to shortness of breath, persistent cough, or hemoptysis as secondary tumors invade lung parenchyma or compress airways and blood vessels, reducing respiratory capacity.

The pathophysiology of these metastatic symptoms generally involves three mechanisms: direct invasion of tumor cells into surrounding tissues, causing local destruction and inflammation; compression of adjacent structures like nerves, vessels, or ducts by expanding tumor masses; and the formation of secondary tumors that secrete factors leading to paraneoplastic effects or organ dysfunction. For instance, bone metastases may trigger hypercalcemia through osteolytic activity, exacerbating pain and fatigue.

In patients with a known cancer diagnosis, the onset of new, unexplained symptoms—such as unexplained bone pain or sudden neurological changes—raises high suspicion for metastasis and necessitates prompt diagnostic workup, including imaging like CT, MRI, or PET scans, and possibly biopsy, to confirm spread and guide targeted therapies. Early recognition of these manifestations can improve symptom management and prognosis through interventions like radiation or systemic treatments.

## Causes and Risk Factors

### Chemical Carcinogens

Chemical carcinogens are exogenous substances that can initiate or promote cancer development by interacting with cellular processes, particularly through genotoxic effects on DNA. These agents are diverse, including components of tobacco smoke, industrial pollutants, and naturally occurring toxins, and their carcinogenicity is evaluated based on epidemiological, experimental, and mechanistic evidence. Exposure often occurs via inhalation, ingestion, or dermal contact, leading to dose-dependent risks that vary by chemical potency and individual susceptibility factors.

Tobacco smoke contains over 70 known carcinogens, with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) such as **benzo[a]pyrene** and tobacco-specific nitrosamines like **4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK)** being among the most potent contributors to lung and bladder cancers. PAHs in cigarette smoke arise from incomplete combustion of tobacco and additives, while nitrosamines form during curing and processing; epidemiological studies link chronic exposure to a 15- to 30-fold increased risk of lung cancer in smokers. These compounds are classified as Group 1 carcinogens by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), indicating sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in humans.

Industrial and occupational chemicals represent another major class of carcinogens, with **asbestos** (a fibrous silicate mineral) strongly associated with mesothelioma and lung cancer due to its inhalation in mining, construction, and shipbuilding settings. **Benzene**, a volatile aromatic hydrocarbon used in petrochemical production and as a solvent, is linked to acute myeloid leukemia through bone marrow toxicity and chromosomal damage. Naturally produced **aflatoxins**, mycotoxins from *Aspergillus* fungi contaminating foodstuffs like peanuts and corn, primarily cause hepatocellular carcinoma, especially in regions with high dietary exposure. All three—asbestos, benzene, and aflatoxins—are IARC Group 1 agents, with global bans or regulations implemented to mitigate risks, such as the U.S. EPA's phase-out of asbestos use.

The primary mechanism of chemical carcinogenesis involves metabolic activation to reactive electrophiles that form covalent **DNA adducts**, leading to mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. For instance, benzo[a]pyrene from tobacco smoke is oxidized by cytochrome P450 enzymes to the ultimate carcinogen **benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-diol epoxide (BPDE)**, which binds preferentially to guanine bases in DNA, forming stable adducts that, if unrepaired, cause G-to-T transversions during replication. This process, first elucidated in seminal studies on PAH metabolism, underlies the initiation phase of tumorigenesis and is a key biomarker for exposure assessment in molecular epidemiology. Adduct formation is modulated by detoxification pathways like glutathione S-transferase, but overload can overwhelm repair mechanisms, promoting clonal expansion of mutated cells.

The IARC Monographs program systematically classifies chemicals into groups based on carcinogenic hazard: Group 1 (carcinogenic to humans, e.g., tobacco smoke, asbestos), Group 2A (probably carcinogenic, e.g., some PAHs), and Group 2B (possibly carcinogenic). As of 2025, 135 agents are in Group 1, guiding international regulations like the EU's REACH framework and WHO's tobacco control measures to reduce exposure. These evaluations integrate human cohort studies, animal bioassays, and mechanistic data, emphasizing prevention through substitution and exposure limits.

| Chemical | IARC Group | Associated Cancers | Primary Exposure Sources |
|----------|------------|---------------------|--------------------------|
| Tobacco smoke (PAHs, nitrosamines) | 1 | Lung, bladder | Smoking, secondhand smoke |
| Asbestos | 1 | Mesothelioma, lung | Occupational (construction, mining) |
| Benzene | 1 | Leukemia | Industrial solvents, fuels |
| Aflatoxins | 1 | Liver | Contaminated foods (nuts, grains) |

### Lifestyle and Environmental Factors

Lifestyle and environmental factors play a significant role in cancer development, as certain modifiable behaviors and exposures can substantially influence risk through mechanisms such as inflammation, hormonal disruption, and DNA damage. These factors are distinct from inherent genetic predispositions or infectious causes, emphasizing the potential for prevention through behavioral changes. Among the most studied are dietary patterns, physical inactivity, alcohol consumption, and obesity, each contributing to elevated risks for specific cancers like colorectal, breast, and liver types.

Dietary habits, particularly high consumption of red and processed meats, are linked to increased colorectal cancer risk primarily due to heme iron, a component that promotes oxidative stress and cellular damage in the colon. Epidemiological studies indicate that daily intake of 120 grams of red meat elevates this risk by approximately 24%, while processed meats show a stronger association at 36% for 30 grams per day. Conversely, diets rich in fiber from fruits, vegetables, and whole grains offer protective effects against colorectal cancer by facilitating bowel regularity, binding potential carcinogens, and supporting a healthy gut microbiome; meta-analyses show that an additional 10 grams of daily fiber intake reduces risk by about 10%. Both soluble and insoluble fibers contribute to this benefit, with insoluble types particularly aiding in reducing transit time for harmful compounds.

A sedentary lifestyle independently heightens cancer risk, with prolonged sitting or low physical activity associated with 20-30% increased incidence for breast and colon cancers compared to active individuals. Regular exercise mitigates this by improving insulin sensitivity, reducing inflammation, and regulating hormone levels, with meta-analyses confirming a 24% lower colon cancer risk among physically active populations. This protective effect is evident across multiple studies, underscoring the importance of at least moderate activity to counteract the harms of inactivity.

Alcohol consumption poses a dose-dependent risk for several cancers, with its metabolite acetaldehyde directly damaging DNA and proteins while generating reactive oxygen species that promote mutagenesis. Even moderate intake elevates esophageal cancer risk, while heavier use strongly correlates with liver cancer through chronic inflammation and fibrosis; the risk rises linearly with grams consumed daily, affecting upper aerodigestive tract sites foremost.

Obesity, characterized by excess adipose tissue, drives cancer risk via chronic low-grade inflammation and altered hormone production, particularly excess estrogen from aromatization in fat cells, which fuels hormone-sensitive tumors like those in the breast and endometrium. Inflamed adipose tissue releases pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor, alongside elevated estradiol, linking obesity to up to 13 cancer types with increased incidence and poorer prognosis in postmenopausal women.

### Infectious Agents

Infections by certain viruses, bacteria, and parasites are established causes of various cancers, primarily through mechanisms involving chronic inflammation, direct cellular transformation, and immune evasion. These infectious agents are classified as Group 1 carcinogens by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), indicating sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in humans.

Among viruses, human papillomavirus (HPV), particularly high-risk types such as HPV-16 and HPV-18, is a major cause of cervical cancer. The viral oncoproteins E6 and E7 play central roles by binding and degrading the tumor suppressor protein p53 (via E6) and inactivating the retinoblastoma protein pRb (via E7), thereby disrupting cell cycle control and promoting uncontrolled proliferation. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) are primary etiological agents of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common type of liver cancer. Chronic infection with these viruses leads to persistent hepatic inflammation, fibrosis, and cirrhosis, creating a microenvironment conducive to oncogenic mutations; HBV additionally integrates its DNA into host genomes, directly altering cellular genes. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a herpesvirus, is associated with several lymphomas, including Burkitt lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders. EBV immortalizes B lymphocytes through latent membrane proteins (e.g., LMP1) that mimic CD40 signaling, activating NF-κB pathways and inhibiting apoptosis, particularly in immunocompromised individuals.

Bacterial infections also contribute to carcinogenesis, with *Helicobacter pylori* being the leading cause of gastric cancer, responsible for the majority of non-cardia adenocarcinomas. This Gram-negative bacterium colonizes the gastric mucosa, inducing chronic gastritis that progresses to atrophy, intestinal metaplasia, and dysplasia. The virulence factor CagA, delivered via a type IV secretion system, is translocated into epithelial cells where it phosphorylates and activates signaling cascades such as Src and PI3K, promoting cell motility, inflammation, and eventual malignant transformation.

Parasitic infections, though less common globally, are significant in endemic areas. *Schistosoma haematobium*, a trematode prevalent in Africa and the Middle East, causes squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder through chronic urinary tract inflammation and irritation from egg deposition, leading to epithelial hyperplasia, fibrosis, and genotoxic damage from nitrosamines produced by bacterial superinfections. Similarly, the liver fluke *Opisthorchis viverrini*, found in Southeast Asia, induces cholangiocarcinoma by provoking chronic biliary tract inflammation, oxidative stress, and periductal fibrosis; parasite secretions and immune responses generate reactive oxygen species that damage DNA in cholangiocytes.

Globally, infectious agents account for approximately 12% of all new cancer cases, equating to about 2.4 million incident cases in 2022, with a disproportionate burden in low- and middle-income countries where the proportion can reach up to 25% in some regions of Africa and Asia due to limited sanitation and vaccination coverage.

### Radiation and Physical Agents

Ionizing radiation, which includes ultraviolet (UV) light and X-rays, is a well-established physical carcinogen that induces DNA damage leading to cancer. UV radiation, particularly UVB wavelengths, penetrates the skin and causes the formation of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and (6-4) photoproducts in DNA, which are highly mutagenic and primarily responsible for skin cancers such as basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma. These lesions, if unrepaired, lead to characteristic C\u003eT transition mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes like TP53, driving photocarcinogenesis.

Diagnostic imaging procedures involving X-rays and computed tomography (CT) scans expose bone marrow to ionizing radiation, elevating the risk of leukemia, especially in children. Studies of pediatric CT exposures have shown a dose-dependent increase in leukemia incidence, with estimated red bone marrow doses as low as 5-10 mGy associated with a detectable excess risk of acute lymphoblastic and myeloid leukemias. This risk arises from radiation-induced mutations in hematopoietic stem cells within the bone marrow, with cumulative exposures from multiple scans amplifying the effect.

The relationship between ionizing radiation exposure and cancer risk is described by the linear no-threshold (LNT) model, which posits that carcinogenic effects occur proportionally to dose without a safe threshold, even at low levels. This model originated from early radiobiology experiments on mutations in fruit flies and was formalized for human protection based on epidemiological data from high-dose exposures, such as atomic bomb survivors, extrapolated linearly to low doses. The LNT framework underpins radiation safety standards, assuming that risks from low-dose exposures, like those from medical imaging, are small but nonzero and cumulative over lifetime.

Beyond radiation, mechanical physical agents, such as chronic friction and irritation, can promote carcinogenesis through persistent tissue damage and inflammation. For instance, habitual pipe smoking causes localized mechanical irritation and thermal injury to the lower lip, establishing a causal link to squamous cell carcinoma of the lip via epithelial hyperplasia and eventual malignant transformation.

Asbestos fibers represent another key physical carcinogen, acting through direct mechanical disruption and indirect inflammatory pathways to induce lung cancer and mesothelioma. Upon inhalation, durable asbestos fibers, particularly amphibole types like crocidolite, embed in lung parenchyma and pleural tissues, triggering frustrated phagocytosis by macrophages, which releases reactive oxygen species (ROS) and pro-inflammatory cytokines. This chronic inflammation leads to DNA strand breaks, epigenetic alterations, and activation of oncogenes like NF-κB, with fiber length and biopersistence determining potency—longer fibers (\u003e5 μm) being more carcinogenic due to impaired clearance.

Occupational exposure to radon gas, an alpha-emitting radioactive decay product of uranium, is a major cause of lung cancer among underground miners. Radon progeny deposit on lung epithelium, delivering high localized doses that induce DNA double-strand breaks and mutations, with cohort studies of uranium miners showing a linear excess relative risk of lung cancer at 1.7% per 100 working level months (WLM) of exposure. This risk is multiplicative with smoking but persists independently in nonsmokers, underscoring radon's role as a potent physical carcinogen in mining environments.

### Genetic and Hereditary Factors

Approximately 5% to 10% of all cancers are attributable to inherited genetic changes passed from a parent. These hereditary factors primarily involve germline mutations in specific genes that predispose individuals to certain cancer types, often following an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern with incomplete penetrance. While most cancers arise sporadically, understanding these genetic predispositions enables targeted screening and preventive measures for at-risk families.

Hereditary syndromes exemplify high-penetrance genetic risks, such as mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, which account for 5% to 10% of breast cancer cases and a significant proportion of ovarian cancers. Individuals carrying pathogenic variants in BRCA1 or BRCA2 face lifetime breast cancer risks of 55% to 72% and ovarian cancer risks of 39% to 44%, respectively, highlighting the substantial impact of these mutations on familial cancer burden. Similarly, Lynch syndrome, caused by germline defects in DNA mismatch repair genes including MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2, is responsible for about 3% of colorectal cancers and increases the lifetime risk of colorectal cancer to 52% to 82%. This syndrome also elevates risks for endometrial, ovarian, and other cancers due to impaired DNA repair mechanisms that lead to microsatellite instability.

In contrast, the majority of cancers develop through the accumulation of somatic mutations in non-inherited cells, as described by Knudson's two-hit hypothesis originally proposed for retinoblastoma. This model posits that both hereditary and sporadic forms of retinoblastoma require inactivation of both alleles of the RB1 tumor suppressor gene: in familial cases, one mutation is germline and the second is somatic, while sporadic cases necessitate two somatic hits. The hypothesis has broader implications, explaining how somatic mutations drive the onset of many common cancers without a hereditary component. Additionally, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous low-penetrance common variants that contribute to cancer risk, which can be aggregated into polygenic risk scores (PRS) to estimate an individual's overall genetic susceptibility. These PRS, incorporating hundreds of variants, refine risk prediction beyond high-penetrance genes and interact with environmental factors to modulate cancer incidence.

### Hormonal and Autoimmune Influences

Hormonal imbalances significantly contribute to cancer risk by promoting uncontrolled cell growth in hormone-sensitive tissues. Prolonged exposure to estrogen is a key risk factor for hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer, which accounts for approximately 70-75% of cases, as estrogen binds to estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) on breast epithelial cells, stimulating proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis. Women with extended endogenous estrogen exposure, such as those experiencing early menarche or late menopause, face a 20-50% higher risk of developing this subtype compared to those with shorter exposure periods. Similarly, elevated insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels, often associated with obesity and metabolic syndrome, increase endometrial cancer risk by activating IGF-1 receptor signaling, which enhances endometrial cell proliferation and survival. Hyperinsulinemia can upregulate local estrogen production in adipose tissue, further exacerbating this risk in postmenopausal women.

Autoimmune diseases elevate cancer risk primarily through chronic inflammation and immune system dysregulation, which foster a microenvironment conducive to malignant transformation. In primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS), patients exhibit an 8- to 10-fold increased standardized incidence ratio (SIR) for non-Hodgkin lymphoma, driven by persistent B-cell hyperactivity and ectopic lymphoid structures in salivary glands. This risk is further heightened by factors like leukopenia and corticosteroid use, with lymphoma often manifesting as mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) type. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is linked to a 12- to 27-fold elevated SIR for hematologic malignancies, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and leukemia, owing to impaired immune surveillance and recurrent infections that promote lymphoproliferation. Older age at SLE onset independently doubles the odds of these malignancies compared to younger-onset cases.

The underlying mechanisms involve hormone-driven proliferation, where ligands like estrogen and IGF-1 bind nuclear receptors to activate gene transcription programs that upregulate cyclins and growth factors, leading to sustained cell division in breast and endometrial tissues. In autoimmune contexts, immune evasion arises from dysregulated tolerance, where chronic autoantigen stimulation exhausts cytotoxic T cells and promotes regulatory T-cell dominance, impairing anti-tumor immunity and allowing nascent cancers to escape detection. A representative example is oral contraceptive use, which reduces ovarian cancer risk by 30-50% after 5 or more years of use through ovulation suppression and decreased gonadotropin exposure, but increases cervical cancer risk by 20-60% in human papillomavirus-infected women due to progestin-enhanced viral persistence and epithelial changes.

## Pathophysiology

### Genetic Mutations

Genetic mutations play a central role in the initiation and progression of cancer by altering DNA sequences that disrupt normal cellular regulation. These somatic alterations accumulate in the genome of cancer cells, leading to uncontrolled proliferation, evasion of cell death, and other hallmarks of malignancy. Unlike germline mutations that may predispose individuals to cancer, somatic mutations arise sporadically within tumors and drive oncogenesis through specific genetic changes.

Oncogenes arise from mutations that activate proto-oncogenes, promoting excessive cell growth and division. For instance, mutations in RAS genes, which encode GTPases involved in signal transduction, occur in approximately 19% of all human cancers and constitutively activate downstream pathways like MAPK, thereby enhancing proliferation. In Burkitt lymphoma, deregulation via chromosomal translocation of the MYC oncogene, a transcription factor that regulates cell cycle genes, drives aggressive B-cell proliferation and is associated with poor prognosis in some cases.

Tumor suppressor genes, conversely, normally inhibit cell growth, and their inactivation through mutations allows unchecked tumor development. The TP53 gene, encoding the p53 protein that induces apoptosis in response to DNA damage, is mutated in over 50% of human cancers, leading to loss of this protective mechanism and genomic instability. A notable example is Li-Fraumeni syndrome, where germline TP53 mutations confer a lifetime cancer risk approaching 90%, predisposing carriers to multiple tumor types including sarcomas, breast cancers, and brain tumors due to impaired DNA repair and apoptosis.

Within tumors, mutations are classified as driver or passenger based on their functional impact. Driver mutations confer a selective growth advantage to cancer cells, while passenger mutations are neutral byproducts of genomic instability that do not directly contribute to tumorigenesis. This distinction underlies clonal evolution in cancer, where driver mutations enable Darwinian selection of fitter subclones, leading to intratumor heterogeneity and disease progression.

Mutational signatures provide insights into the mutational processes shaping cancer genomes, reflecting specific patterns of DNA alterations. In breast cancer, APOBEC enzymes induce cytosine-to-thymine mutations at TC dinucleotides, contributing to tumor evolution and therapy resistance. Similarly, ultraviolet radiation exposure generates a signature of C\u003eT transitions at dipyrimidine sites, predominantly observed in skin cancers like melanoma, highlighting the environmental etiology of these mutations.

### Epigenetic Modifications

Epigenetic modifications in cancer involve heritable changes in gene expression without alterations to the underlying DNA sequence, playing a critical role in tumorigenesis by silencing tumor suppressor genes and activating oncogenes. These changes include DNA methylation, histone modifications, and regulation by non-coding RNAs, which collectively disrupt normal cellular control mechanisms. Unlike genetic mutations, which permanently alter DNA and are covered elsewhere, epigenetic alterations can interact with mutations to enhance cancer progression but are often reversible, offering therapeutic opportunities.

DNA methylation, primarily occurring at CpG islands in gene promoters, leads to gene silencing through the addition of methyl groups to cytosine bases, a process mediated by DNA methyltransferases. In cancer, aberrant hypermethylation frequently inactivates tumor suppressor genes; for instance, hypermethylation of the O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter in gliomas silences this DNA repair gene, impairing the cell's ability to counteract alkylating agents and promoting genomic instability. This modification is observed in approximately 40-50% of glioblastoma cases and serves as a prognostic biomarker for improved response to temozolomide chemotherapy.

Histone modifications, such as acetylation and deacetylation, regulate chromatin structure and accessibility for transcription factors, thereby influencing gene expression. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) remove acetyl groups from lysine residues on histone tails, leading to chromatin condensation and repression of gene transcription; overexpression of HDACs in cancers contributes to tumorigenesis primarily by repressing tumor suppressor genes, such as those involved in cell cycle control and apoptosis, thereby promoting oncogene activity and proliferation. For example, HDAC1 and HDAC2 are upregulated in various solid tumors, where they repress genes like p21, enhancing cell growth. HDAC inhibitors, such as vorinostat, exploit this mechanism to restore acetylation and reactivate silenced genes.

Non-coding RNAs, particularly microRNAs (miRNAs), post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression by binding to messenger RNAs, leading to their degradation or translational repression. In multiple cancers, miR-21 is overexpressed and acts as an oncomiR by targeting the tumor suppressor PTEN, which normally inhibits the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway to prevent uncontrolled cell growth. This repression of PTEN by miR-21 has been documented in hepatocellular carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and colorectal cancer, where elevated miR-21 levels correlate with increased invasion and poor prognosis.00817-3/fulltext)

The reversibility of epigenetic modifications distinguishes them from genetic changes and underpins targeted therapies that restore normal gene expression patterns. DNA methyltransferase inhibitors like azacitidine, approved by the FDA in 2004 for myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), incorporate into RNA and DNA to deplete methyltransferases, leading to hypomethylation and re-expression of silenced genes such as p15 and p16. Clinical trials, including the AZA-001 study, demonstrated that azacitidine extends overall survival in higher-risk MDS patients by 9.4 months compared to conventional care, highlighting its role in epigenetic reprogramming.70001-8/fulltext)

### Metastatic Mechanisms

Metastasis, the spread of cancer cells from the primary tumor to distant sites, is a complex, multi-step process that enables the formation of secondary tumors. This dissemination begins with the acquisition of invasive properties by cancer cells, allowing them to breach tissue barriers and enter the circulatory system, followed by their survival during transit, arrest at distant organs, and eventual colonization. Central to these events is the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a reversible program that transforms adherent epithelial cells into motile mesenchymal cells, enhancing their migratory and invasive capabilities.

During EMT, transcription factors such as SNAIL and TWIST play pivotal roles in repressing epithelial markers like E-cadherin while upregulating mesenchymal genes such as vimentin and N-cadherin, thereby promoting cell motility and resistance to apoptosis. SNAIL, for instance, induces EMT by directly suppressing E-cadherin expression and activating pathways that facilitate tumor cell invasion into surrounding stroma. Similarly, TWIST drives EMT through similar transcriptional repression and is associated with increased metastatic potential in various carcinomas. These factors are often upregulated by signals from the tumor microenvironment, such as transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), underscoring their context-dependent activation in metastasis.

Following EMT, cancer cells undergo intravasation, the entry into blood or lymphatic vessels, and later extravasation, their exit at distant sites, both processes heavily reliant on the degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), a family of zinc-dependent endopeptidases, are key effectors in these steps; for example, MMP-2 and MMP-9 remodel the ECM to create breaches in the basement membrane, enabling tumor cell intravasation into the bloodstream. During extravasation, MMPs facilitate adhesion to endothelial cells and penetration through vessel walls, with MMP-9 particularly implicated in promoting transendothelial migration in experimental models of metastasis. Dysregulated MMP activity not only aids physical invasion but also releases bioactive ECM fragments that further stimulate tumor progression.

Prior to the arrival of circulating tumor cells, primary tumors establish a pre-metastatic niche at future metastatic sites through secreted factors that prime the microenvironment for colonization. The chemokine CXCL12, produced by stromal cells in target organs, interacts with its receptor CXCR4 on cancer cells to direct their homing and survival, creating a supportive niche via signaling that enhances cell adhesion and proliferation. This CXCL12/CXCR4 axis recruits bone marrow-derived cells to the niche, fostering vascular permeability and immunosuppression, as demonstrated in models where CXCR4 blockade disrupts pre-metastatic conditioning and reduces metastasis incidence. Such signaling exemplifies how tumors orchestrate distant site preparation to favor seeding.

The non-random distribution of metastases, known as organ tropism, is elegantly captured by Stephen Paget's 1889 "seed and soil" hypothesis, which posits that viable tumor cells (seeds) preferentially metastasize to compatible organ microenvironments (soils) rather than disseminating randomly. For instance, breast cancer cells exhibit a strong tropism for bone due to the supportive bone marrow niche rich in growth factors like TGF-β, which activates osteoclasts and promotes osteolytic lesions upon seeding. This hypothesis has been validated through clinical observations and experimental data showing that tropism arises from molecular compatibilities, such as CXCR4 expression guiding breast cancer cells to CXCL12-abundant bones. Modern extensions incorporate dynamic interactions between seed properties and soil factors, explaining patterns like prostate cancer's affinity for bone.

### Tumor Metabolism

Cancer cells exhibit distinct metabolic reprogramming compared to normal cells, enabling rapid proliferation and survival in nutrient-limited environments. This adaptation, often termed the metabolic hallmarks of cancer, prioritizes biosynthetic pathways over efficient energy production, diverting resources toward biomass generation such as nucleotides, amino acids, and lipids.01066-0)

A hallmark of this reprogramming is the Warburg effect, where cancer cells preferentially utilize aerobic glycolysis even in the presence of oxygen, leading to increased glucose uptake and lactate production rather than complete oxidation in mitochondria. This shift, first observed by Otto Warburg in the 1920s, supports rapid ATP generation and provides glycolytic intermediates for biosynthesis, with lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) upregulated to convert pyruvate to lactate, maintaining NAD+ levels for sustained glycolysis. In many tumors, such as those in breast and lung cancers, this results in elevated lactate levels that acidify the tumor microenvironment, promoting invasion and immune evasion.01066-0)

Many cancers also display glutamine addiction, relying heavily on glutamine as a carbon and nitrogen source for proliferation. In MYC-driven cancers, like lymphomas and neuroblastomas, the glutaminase enzyme (GLS) is upregulated, facilitating glutamine conversion to glutamate and entry into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle for nucleotide and amino acid synthesis. This dependency arises from MYC's transcriptional activation of glutaminolytic genes, making glutamine depletion a potential therapeutic vulnerability in these tumors.00366-8)

Metabolic vulnerabilities in cancer include mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (IDH1/2), prevalent in gliomas and acute myeloid leukemias, which produce the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) instead of α-ketoglutarate. This neomorphic activity inhibits α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases, disrupting epigenetic regulation and promoting tumorigenesis by altering DNA and histone methylation patterns.00527-1) In gliomas, IDH1/2 mutations occur in over 70% of low-grade cases, with 2-HG levels reaching millimolar concentrations that mimic hypoxia-inducible factors.

Therapeutic strategies target these metabolic alterations, such as metformin, a biguanide used for type 2 diabetes, which inhibits mitochondrial complex I and downstream mTOR signaling to suppress cancer cell growth. Epidemiological data link metformin use in diabetics to reduced cancer incidence, including colorectal and breast cancers, by up to 30-50%, attributed to its role in lowering insulin levels and directly impairing tumor bioenergetics.00441-0) Clinical trials are exploring metformin in combination therapies to exploit these vulnerabilities, particularly in metabolic-dependent tumors.

## Diagnosis

### Clinical Evaluation

Clinical evaluation begins with a thorough assessment of the patient's history and physical findings to identify signs suggestive of cancer and guide subsequent diagnostic steps. This initial evaluation is crucial for determining the urgency of further investigation and establishing a baseline for the patient's overall health status. It integrates patient-reported information with objective clinical observations to contextualize symptoms within the broader risk profile.

History taking forms the cornerstone of clinical evaluation, focusing on the patient's chief complaint, family history, risk factors, and symptom characteristics. A detailed family history is obtained by constructing a three-generation pedigree that includes cancers in first-, second-, and third-degree relatives, noting the age at diagnosis, tumor types, and any hereditary patterns to assess for inherited syndromes such as Lynch or familial adenomatous polyposis. Risk factors are systematically reviewed, encompassing lifestyle elements like tobacco and alcohol use, environmental exposures, and personal medical history such as prior cancers or ethnic predispositions (e.g., Ashkenazi Jewish heritage increasing BRCA-related risks). Symptom duration and progression are carefully documented using a chronological timeline, including onset, aggravating or relieving factors, and any delays in seeking care, which can influence prognosis and inform the likelihood of advanced disease.

The physical examination complements history taking by providing objective evidence of potential malignancy through systematic inspection and palpation. Key maneuvers include palpation of the abdomen for masses, noting their size, location, fixation, and tenderness, as well as assessment for organomegaly such as hepatomegaly or splenomegaly indicative of underlying tumors or metastases. Lymph node evaluation involves palpating cervical, axillary, and inguinal regions for enlarged, firm, or matted nodes, which may signal lymphadenopathy from primary cancers or dissemination. Additional targeted exams, such as digital rectal examination for prostate irregularities or pelvic examination for cervical abnormalities, are performed based on symptoms to detect palpable lesions.

Performance status scales are employed to quantify the patient's functional capacity and predict tolerance to potential treatments. The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status scale categorizes patients from 0 (fully active, able to carry on all pre-disease activities without restriction) to 5 (dead), assessing ambulatory ability, self-care, and daily activity levels to stratify prognosis and eligibility for clinical trials. Similarly, the Karnofsky Performance Status scale rates function from 100 (normal, no complaints, no evidence of disease) to 0 (dead), evaluating the need for assistance in daily living and medical care requirements, which aids in comparing therapy effectiveness and forecasting survival in advanced cancer.

Certain findings during evaluation warrant immediate concern as red flags for occult malignancy. Unexplained weight loss, particularly exceeding 10% of body weight over six months, signals possible cachexia from underlying cancer and necessitates prompt investigation. Persistent, unexplained pain—such as ongoing back, abdominal, or joint discomfort not attributable to injury—represents another critical indicator, often reflecting tumor invasion or metastatic spread, and should prompt expedited referral.

### Imaging Techniques

Imaging techniques play a crucial role in the detection, localization, and characterization of tumors in cancer patients by providing non-invasive visualization of anatomical structures and functional processes. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are primary modalities for assessing anatomical details, such as tumor size, location, and involvement of surrounding tissues. CT scans utilize X-rays to generate cross-sectional images, offering high-resolution views of dense structures like bones and lungs, which is particularly useful for staging thoracic and abdominal malignancies. MRI, employing magnetic fields and radio waves, excels in soft tissue contrast, making it ideal for evaluating brain, liver, and musculoskeletal tumors without ionizing radiation exposure.

Positron emission tomography combined with CT (PET-CT) integrates metabolic and anatomical information, enhancing tumor detection through the uptake of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), a radioactive glucose analog that accumulates in hypermetabolic cancer cells. This modality is widely used for identifying metabolically active lesions in lymphomas, lung cancers, and colorectal metastases, with sensitivity often exceeding 90% for FDG-avid tumors. In comparison, PET-MRI offers superior soft tissue resolution and reduced radiation compared to PET-CT, showing comparable or better performance in staging head and neck, breast, and prostate cancers.

Specific imaging methods are tailored to organ systems for optimal tumor detection. Mammography, a low-dose X-ray technique, is the standard for breast cancer screening, detecting microcalcifications and masses with a sensitivity of 85-90% in women aged 40-74, as recommended by major guidelines for annual or biennial use in average-risk populations. Ultrasound serves as the initial imaging for thyroid nodules, distinguishing solid from cystic lesions and identifying suspicious features like microcalcifications or irregular margins, with high specificity for guiding fine-needle aspiration in nodules over 1 cm. For gastrointestinal cancers, endoscopy provides direct visualization of the esophageal, stomach, and colorectal mucosa, enabling early detection of precancerous lesions like Barrett's esophagus or adenomas through high-definition optics and biopsy capabilities.

Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have improved the accuracy of imaging for early cancer detection, particularly in identifying subtle lung nodules on low-dose CT scans. AI algorithms, such as deep learning models, achieve sensitivities of 70-93% for nodule detection, outperforming or matching radiologists in reducing false negatives and prioritizing high-risk findings in lung cancer screening programs. Transformer-based AI systems further enhance segmentation and classification of nodules, facilitating earlier intervention in high-risk smokers.

Despite these benefits, ionizing radiation from CT and PET-CT scans poses risks, particularly with cumulative doses from serial imaging in cancer follow-up. Effective doses from a single chest CT range from 5-7 mSv, and cumulative exposures exceeding 100 mSv in patients with multiple scans are associated with a 1-2% increased lifetime attributable cancer risk, varying by age, sex, and scanned region. Guidelines emphasize dose optimization, such as using low-dose protocols and alternating with non-ionizing modalities like MRI or ultrasound, to minimize long-term stochastic effects.

### Biopsy and Laboratory Tests

Biopsy procedures are essential for obtaining tissue samples to confirm the presence of cancer cells and determine their characteristics. These methods allow pathologists to examine cellular morphology and molecular features directly from the tumor site. Common biopsy techniques include fine-needle aspiration (FNA), core needle biopsy (CNB), and surgical biopsy, each selected based on the tumor's location, size, and accessibility. FNA involves using a thin needle to extract cells from a lump or mass, providing rapid results but often limited to cytological analysis rather than full tissue architecture. CNB employs a larger needle to obtain a cylindrical core of tissue, enabling more accurate histopathological diagnosis compared to FNA, with higher rates of definitive benign or malignant classification. Surgical biopsy, including excisional or incisional approaches, removes a larger portion or the entire suspicious area and is typically reserved for cases where less invasive methods are inconclusive or when comprehensive sampling is needed. Many biopsies are performed under imaging guidance, such as ultrasound or CT, to precisely target the lesion.

Liquid biopsy represents a non-invasive alternative or complement to tissue sampling, particularly for ongoing monitoring. It analyzes circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) shed into the bloodstream by tumor cells, allowing detection of genetic alterations without repeated invasive procedures. ctDNA-based liquid biopsies are valuable for tracking treatment response, identifying minimal residual disease, and detecting emerging resistance mutations in real time. This approach has shown promise in various cancers, though challenges remain in sensitivity for low-burden disease and standardization across platforms.

Laboratory tests often include the measurement of tumor markers, which are substances produced by cancer cells or the body in response to malignancy, aiding in diagnosis and surveillance. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a widely used blood-based marker for prostate cancer, where elevated levels may prompt further investigation, though its specificity is limited by elevations in benign conditions like prostatitis. Similarly, cancer antigen 125 (CA-125) serves as a marker for ovarian cancer, with a sensitivity of approximately 79% for detection, but it lacks specificity due to elevations in non-malignant states such as endometriosis or pregnancy. These markers are not diagnostic alone and must be interpreted alongside clinical findings, as false positives can lead to unnecessary procedures.

Pathological examination of biopsy samples typically begins with hematoxylin and eosin (H\u0026E) staining, the standard method for visualizing tissue structure and identifying malignant features like irregular nuclei and mitotic activity. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) builds on this by using antibodies to detect specific proteins, providing insights into tumor biology; for instance, IHC assesses human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression in breast cancer, where overexpression (scored 3+) indicates eligibility for targeted therapies. IHC for HER2 offers high efficiency in metastatic cases, with sensitivity and specificity around 95-96%, though equivocal results (score 2+) often require confirmatory testing.

Molecular testing on biopsy material has advanced with next-generation sequencing (NGS), a high-throughput technique that profiles multiple genetic alterations simultaneously. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), NGS detects epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations, such as exon 19 deletions or L858R substitutions, which occur in about 10-15% of cases and guide targeted inhibitor use. NGS surpasses traditional methods like Sanger sequencing in identifying complex or rare variants, with advantages in sensitivity for low-frequency mutations in heterogeneous tumors. This approach enables comprehensive genomic profiling, informing personalized diagnostic strategies.

## Classification

### Histopathological Types

Histopathological classification of cancer relies on the microscopic examination of tumor tissue to identify the cell of origin and characteristic morphological features, enabling categorization into distinct types that guide diagnosis and treatment. This approach, standardized by organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO), emphasizes tissue architecture, cellular differentiation, and patterns observed under light microscopy following biopsy or surgical resection.

Carcinomas, the most prevalent histopathological type accounting for 80-90% of all human cancers, arise from epithelial cells lining organs, glands, or body surfaces. They are subdivided based on the type of epithelium involved: adenocarcinomas originate from glandular epithelium and exhibit microscopic features such as glandular structures or mucin production, commonly affecting sites like the lung, breast, colon, and prostate; in contrast, squamous cell carcinomas develop from squamous epithelium and display keratin pearls, intercellular bridges, and flattened cells, frequently occurring in the skin, lung, esophagus, and cervix. For instance, in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the WHO classification recognizes adenocarcinoma as the predominant subtype, characterized by lepidic, acinar, or papillary growth patterns.03316-5/fulltext)

Sarcomas originate from mesenchymal cells of connective tissues, including bone, muscle, fat, and cartilage, and represent a rarer category comprising about 1% of adult malignancies but up to 15% in children. Microscopically, they often appear as spindle-shaped or pleomorphic cells resembling the native tissue, forming whorled or fascicular patterns. Osteosarcomas, for example, produce osteoid matrix and affect bone, showing malignant osteoblasts under microscopy, while leiomyosarcomas derive from smooth muscle and feature intersecting fascicles of spindle cells with cigar-shaped nuclei and varying degrees of atypia.

Leukemias and lymphomas emerge from hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues, classified by cell lineage and maturity under microscopic and flow cytometric analysis. Leukemias involve the bone marrow and blood, with overproduction of immature blasts; acute myeloid leukemia shows myeloblasts with Auer rods, while chronic lymphocytic leukemia displays small mature lymphocytes. Lymphomas form solid tumors in lymph nodes or extranodal sites, with subtypes like Hodgkin lymphoma featuring Reed-Sternberg cells amid inflammatory backgrounds, and non-Hodgkin lymphomas encompassing diverse B- or T-cell proliferations with follicular or diffuse architectures. The WHO classification delineates over 80 lymphoma subtypes based on these features.

Germ cell tumors develop from primordial germ cells, typically in the gonads or midline structures like the mediastinum, and are identified microscopically by primitive elements mimicking embryonic development. They include seminomas with uniform cells and lymphocytic infiltrates, yolk sac tumors showing Schiller-Duval bodies, and mixed forms combining multiple components like embryonal carcinoma and choriocarcinoma. The WHO system codes these under specific histological groups for ovarian and testicular sites, emphasizing their totipotent potential.

### Staging Systems

Staging systems in oncology provide a standardized method to assess the extent of cancer spread, guiding treatment decisions and prognostic estimates. The most widely adopted system is the TNM classification, which categorizes tumors based on three key components: the primary tumor (T), regional lymph node involvement (N), and distant metastasis (M). Developed by Pierre Denoix in the 1940s and first formalized in the 1950s, the TNM system has become the global standard for solid tumors, enabling consistent communication among healthcare professionals worldwide.

In the TNM framework, the T category describes the size and extent of the primary tumor, ranging from TX (primary tumor cannot be assessed) to T4 (tumor invades adjacent structures extensively), with intermediate categories like T1 for small, localized tumors and Tis for carcinoma in situ. The N category evaluates lymph node involvement, from N0 (no regional lymph node metastasis) to N3 (extensive regional lymph node spread), while the M category indicates distant metastasis as M0 (none) or M1 (present). These categories are site-specific, with criteria varying by cancer type to reflect anatomical differences, such as tumor invasion depth in colorectal cancer versus size in breast cancer. The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) collaboratively maintain and update the TNM system, with the AJCC Version 9 released starting in 2024 and the UICC 9th edition released in 2025 to incorporate refined criteria based on survival data from international registries.

TNM categories are combined into stage groupings from 0 to IV to simplify clinical application and provide prognostic stratification. Stage 0 represents in situ disease, confined to the epithelium without invasion; stage I indicates localized cancer with low risk; stage II involves local extension but no nodal or distant spread; stage III denotes regional spread to lymph nodes; and stage IV signifies distant metastasis, typically associated with advanced disease. These groupings, often subdivided (e.g., IVA, IVB), are tailored per cancer site in the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual and UICC TNM Classification, ensuring they align with evidence from large-scale databases like the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program. Staging requires histological confirmation of malignancy, typically via biopsy, to validate the anatomical findings.

For certain cancers, site-specific systems supplement or replace TNM to better capture disease behavior. The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging is used for gynecologic malignancies, such as cervical, endometrial, and ovarian cancers, emphasizing pelvic organ involvement, lymph node status, and peritoneal spread rather than strict tumor size metrics. For example, the 2023 FIGO update for endometrial cancer integrates myometrial invasion and cervical involvement into stages I-IV, incorporates molecular subtyping to further stratify stages based on prognostic molecular profiles such as p53 abnormal (p53abn) and POLE ultramutated (POLEmut), harmonizing with TNM where possible but prioritizing gynecologic anatomy. Similarly, lymphomas employ the Ann Arbor system, modified as the Lugano classification, which divides disease into stages I-IV based on the number of lymph node regions affected, diaphragmatic involvement, and extranodal sites, with modifiers for bulky disease (X) or systemic symptoms (A/B). This approach differs from TNM by focusing on lymphatic distribution rather than solid tumor dimensions.

Despite its utility, the TNM system has limitations, primarily its reliance on anatomical extent without integrating molecular or biological factors, which can lead to heterogeneous prognoses within the same stage. For instance, advances in genomics reveal that tumors with similar T, N, and M profiles may differ significantly in aggressiveness due to unaccounted variables like biomarker expression, complicating personalized treatment. The system's periodic updates help address evolving data, but its anatomical focus remains a constraint in the era of precision oncology.

### Molecular and Genomic Classification

Molecular and genomic classification of cancer involves analyzing genetic mutations, gene expression patterns, and proteomic profiles to delineate tumor subtypes that inform prognosis, therapeutic response, and personalized treatment strategies. This approach has revolutionized oncology by moving beyond traditional histopathological methods to identify biologically distinct subgroups with varying clinical behaviors. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project has been instrumental in this domain, providing comprehensive multi-omics data that enable robust subtype definitions across various cancers.

In glioblastoma, TCGA analyses have identified four primary molecular subtypes—proneural, neural, classical, and mesenchymal—based on integrated genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic features. The proneural subtype is characterized by mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH1), platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) amplifications, and expression of genes associated with neural progenitor cells, often showing better response to therapies targeting these pathways. In contrast, the mesenchymal subtype exhibits NF1 mutations, higher immune cell infiltration, and upregulation of mesenchymal transition genes, correlating with more aggressive invasion and poorer survival outcomes. These classifications highlight intratumoral heterogeneity and guide targeted interventions, such as those exploiting mesenchymal vulnerabilities in immunotherapy.

Breast cancer exemplifies the application of genomic tools in subtyping, with the PAM50 gene signature—a 50-gene expression panel—stratifying tumors into luminal A, luminal B, HER2-enriched, basal-like, and normal-like categories to predict recurrence risk and tailor endocrine or targeted therapies. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), corresponding largely to the basal-like subtype, lacks expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), comprising about 15-20% of cases and exhibiting high genomic instability with frequent BRCA1/2 mutations, leading to aggressive disease and limited targeted options. Conversely, the HER2-enriched subtype features HER2 amplification and overexpression, often with ER/PR negativity, and responds robustly to anti-HER2 agents like trastuzumab, underscoring the prognostic and therapeutic divergence between these profiles. The PAM50 assay, validated in clinical settings, integrates with these subtypes to refine risk assessment in hormone receptor-positive cases, enabling personalized medicine by identifying low-risk patients who may avoid chemotherapy.

In melanoma, genomic classification centers on driver mutations, with BRAF-mutant tumors—present in approximately 40-50% of cutaneous melanomas—defining a subtype responsive to BRAF and MEK inhibitors like vemurafenib and trametinib. These mutations, predominantly V600E, activate the MAPK pathway, promoting uncontrolled proliferation, and TCGA frameworks further subclassify melanomas into BRAF-mutant, NRAS-mutant, NF1-mutant, and triple-wild-type groups based on mutually exclusive alterations, influencing metastatic potential and immunotherapy efficacy. BRAF-mutant melanomas often arise in younger patients with intermittent sun exposure and show distinct transcriptomic profiles compared to UV-signature-driven subtypes.

A key prognostic implication of genomic classification is seen in colorectal cancer, where microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) tumors—arising from deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) and comprising 15% of cases—exhibit hypermutation and high tumor mutational burden, predicting superior responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors like pembrolizumab. MSI-H status identifies patients with durable clinical benefits, including objective response rates exceeding 40% in metastatic settings, contrasting with microsatellite stable (MSS) tumors that rarely respond to immunotherapy. This biomarker integrates molecular insights with staging systems to prioritize immunotherapy in advanced disease.

## Prevention

### Lifestyle Interventions

Lifestyle interventions play a crucial role in reducing cancer incidence by modifying modifiable risk factors. These behavioral changes, supported by extensive epidemiological evidence, target key contributors to carcinogenesis such as inflammation, oxidative stress, and hormonal imbalances. Adopting these habits can significantly lower the risk of various cancers, with benefits accruing over time through sustained practice.

Tobacco cessation is one of the most impactful lifestyle changes for cancer prevention, particularly for lung cancer. Quitting smoking reduces the risk of lung cancer by 30% to 50% after 10 years compared to continued smoking, as former smokers' risk approaches that of never-smokers over longer periods. This reduction occurs because cessation halts exposure to carcinogens like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and nitrosamines, allowing cellular repair mechanisms to mitigate accumulated DNA damage. The World Health Organization emphasizes that within 10 years of quitting, lung cancer risk falls to about half that of a current smoker.

Limiting alcohol consumption is another essential intervention, as alcohol is a known carcinogen associated with increased risk of breast, colorectal, esophageal, liver, and other cancers. Guidelines recommend no more than one drink per day for women and two for men, or abstinence for optimal prevention; even moderate intake raises breast cancer risk by 7-10%. Mechanisms include acetaldehyde-induced DNA damage and altered hormone levels.

Maintaining a healthy body weight through balanced diet and regular activity is critical, as overweight and obesity are linked to at least 13 types of cancer, including endometrial, postmenopausal breast, and colorectal. Achieving and sustaining a body mass index (BMI) of 18.5-24.9 kg/m² can reduce cancer risk by 10-40% depending on the type, by lowering inflammation, insulin resistance, and sex hormone levels.

Dietary modifications, such as adhering to a Mediterranean diet, have been linked to decreased colorectal cancer risk through its emphasis on antioxidant-rich foods. High adherence to this diet, which includes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and olive oil, is associated with a 16% reduction in colorectal cancer incidence, attributed to polyphenols, flavonoids, and other antioxidants that combat oxidative stress and inflammation in the colonic mucosa. Additionally, avoiding processed meats is recommended, as their consumption increases colorectal cancer risk by 18% per 50 grams daily due to compounds like N-nitroso chemicals formed during processing. Limiting such meats helps prevent heme iron-induced DNA damage and heterocyclic amine formation during cooking.

Regular physical activity is another evidence-based intervention, with guidelines recommending at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week to lower cancer risk. This level of activity is associated with a 12-21% reduction in breast cancer risk among women, likely through mechanisms including reduced estrogen levels, improved insulin sensitivity, and decreased chronic inflammation. The protective effect is consistent across pre- and postmenopausal women, highlighting exercise's role in modulating adiposity-related pathways that promote mammary carcinogenesis.

Sun protection measures, including consistent use of broad-spectrum sunscreen with SPF 15 or higher, are essential for preventing melanoma. Daily application of such sunscreen reduces melanoma risk by up to 50%, as demonstrated in randomized trials, by blocking ultraviolet B radiation that causes DNA mutations in melanocytes. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration supports this, noting that proper sunscreen use, combined with seeking shade and wearing protective clothing, significantly mitigates UV-induced skin damage.

### Chemopreventive Agents

Chemopreventive agents are pharmaceutical compounds used to inhibit or reverse the process of carcinogenesis, primarily for primary prevention in high-risk individuals or secondary prevention to halt progression from precancerous lesions to invasive cancer. These agents target specific molecular pathways involved in tumor initiation and promotion, offering a targeted approach distinct from lifestyle modifications. Key examples include selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) for breast cancer and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like aspirin for colorectal cancer, with efficacy demonstrated in large-scale clinical trials and meta-analyses.

Tamoxifen, a prototypical SERM, is approved for reducing breast cancer incidence in women at high risk, such as those with a 5-year Gail model risk greater than 1.7%. In the Breast Cancer Prevention Trial, tamoxifen reduced the incidence of invasive breast cancer by approximately 50% over 5 years in high-risk postmenopausal women. This risk reduction is primarily observed for estrogen receptor-positive tumors, with a 69% decrease in such cases. Similarly, raloxifene, another SERM, provides comparable but slightly less potent protection, reducing risk by about 38% in the STAR trial.

For colorectal cancer, low-dose aspirin has emerged as an effective chemopreventive agent, particularly in individuals with elevated risk due to factors like familial adenomatous polyposis or prior adenomas. Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials indicate that regular aspirin use reduces colorectal cancer incidence by 20-30%, with a 27% relative risk reduction in observational studies encompassing over 150,000 cases. High-dose regimens (≥325 mg daily) for at least 2 years show more pronounced effects, lowering risk by up to 40% in high-risk cohorts.

The mechanisms of these agents involve interference with key oncogenic pathways. Tamoxifen and other SERMs exert their effects by competitively binding to estrogen receptors in breast tissue, thereby blocking estrogen-driven cell proliferation and reducing the promotional effects of hormonal signaling on mammary carcinogenesis. In contrast, aspirin's chemopreventive action stems from irreversible inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), an enzyme overexpressed in colorectal adenomas that promotes inflammation, angiogenesis, and tumor growth through prostaglandin synthesis; this inhibition disrupts these pro-carcinogenic processes without fully suppressing the housekeeping COX-1 isoform at low doses.

Despite their benefits, chemopreventive agents carry notable risks that necessitate individualized assessment. Tamoxifen increases the risk of venous thromboembolism, including deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, by 1.5- to 3-fold, with an absolute 5-year risk rising from 0.5% to 1.2% in treated women; this thrombotic potential is linked to its pro-estrogenic effects on vascular endothelium. Aspirin, while generally safer, elevates gastrointestinal bleeding risk, particularly at higher doses. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends offering tamoxifen, raloxifene, or aromatase inhibitors to women at increased breast cancer risk after discussing benefits and harms, but advises against routine use in average-risk populations due to adverse effects. For colorectal cancer, USPSTF guidelines on aspirin focus on cardiovascular prevention but acknowledge its CRC risk reduction in select older adults, emphasizing shared decision-making for those aged 50-59 with elevated cardiovascular risk.

### Vaccinations and Public Health Measures

Vaccinations play a crucial role in preventing certain cancers linked to viral infections. The quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine targets HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18, which are responsible for approximately 70% of cervical cancers worldwide. Clinical trials and real-world studies have demonstrated near 100% efficacy in preventing persistent infections and precancerous lesions caused by these vaccine-targeted HPV types when administered before exposure. Similarly, the hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccine has significantly reduced the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in endemic regions, such as parts of Asia and Africa, where chronic HBV infection accounts for up to 80% of liver cancer cases. Universal infant vaccination programs, like those implemented in Taiwan since 1984, have led to a 75-90% decline in childhood liver cancer rates over subsequent decades.

Public health measures, including fiscal and educational strategies, complement vaccination efforts by addressing modifiable risk factors. Increasing tobacco taxes is one of the most effective interventions, with a 10% price hike leading to a 4% reduction in consumption in high-income countries and up to 8% in low- and middle-income countries. These tax policies have contributed to declining smoking prevalence and averted millions of tobacco-related cancer deaths globally. Mass media anti-smoking campaigns, such as the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Tips From Former Smokers initiative, have prompted over 1 million quit attempts and prevented an estimated 129,000 premature deaths between 2012 and 2018, while saving $7.3 billion in healthcare costs.

International eradication efforts emphasize high vaccination coverage to achieve cancer elimination targets. The World Health Organization's global strategy for cervical cancer elimination sets a goal of 90% HPV vaccination coverage among girls by age 15 by 2030, alongside 70% screening and 90% treatment access, to reduce new cases by over 90% in high-burden regions. For HBV, the WHO's Immunization Agenda 2030 aims for 90% coverage of the birth dose in endemic areas to further curb liver cancer incidence. These targets build on evidence from high-coverage programs that have already averted over 1.3 million cervical cancer cases through HPV vaccination since 2006.

Despite these advances, vaccine hesitancy poses a significant challenge to efficacy, driven by misinformation, cultural barriers, and access issues, which have limited global HPV coverage to just 31% for the first dose as of 2024. In regions with low uptake, such as parts of sub-Saharan Africa, hesitancy has delayed progress toward elimination goals and sustained preventable cancer burdens. Addressing hesitancy through community education and policy incentives is essential to maximize public health impact.

## Screening

### General Screening Guidelines

Cancer screening programs seek to detect precancerous lesions or early-stage malignancies in asymptomatic individuals to reduce morbidity and mortality, guided by evidence from randomized controlled trials that weigh benefits against potential harms. Key principles include addressing lead-time bias, where earlier detection prolongs the time from diagnosis to death without altering overall survival, and overdiagnosis, the identification of indolent tumors that would not cause harm if undetected, potentially leading to unnecessary treatments and psychological distress. These risks are mitigated through rigorous trial designs that compare screened and unscreened cohorts over extended follow-up periods to assess true net benefits, such as reductions in cancer-specific mortality.

The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) evaluates screening based on such evidence, assigning grades A or B to interventions with high certainty of substantial net benefit or moderate certainty of moderate net benefit, respectively, and recommending their routine provision in primary care. For instance, USPSTF Grade A recommendations stem from consistent results across multiple well-designed RCTs demonstrating significant health improvements, while Grade B reflects solid but somewhat limited evidence. These gradings inform broad implementation, emphasizing screenings proven effective in diverse populations through trials like those for breast and colorectal cancers.

Common examples of recommended screenings include mammography for breast cancer and colonoscopy or stool-based tests for colorectal cancer. The USPSTF recommends biennial screening mammography for women aged 40 to 74 years (Grade B), with a 2024 update affirming routine screening starting at age 40 rather than individualizing for ages 40-49, supported by meta-analyses of randomized trials showing relative risk reductions in breast cancer mortality ranging from 12% (ages 39-49) to 33% (ages 60-69). For colorectal cancer, the USPSTF advises screening for adults aged 50 to 75 years (Grade A) and 45 to 49 years (Grade B) using options such as colonoscopy every 10 years or annual fecal immunochemical testing (FIT), with evidence from four large RCTs of flexible sigmoidoscopy indicating a 26% reduction in colorectal cancer mortality (mortality rate ratio 0.74, 95% CI 0.68-0.80).

Cost-effectiveness analyses further support these guidelines, often using quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) to quantify benefits relative to costs. Modeling studies show that colorectal cancer screening strategies, such as blood-based multitarget tests, are cost-effective with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of $25,600 to $43,700 per QALY gained compared to no screening.00174-4/fulltext) Similarly, breast cancer screening programs demonstrate favorable economics, averting deaths at costs below common willingness-to-pay thresholds like $100,000 per QALY in long-term projections.30372-1/fulltext)

Despite these established benefits, equity challenges undermine screening effectiveness, particularly in low-resource settings where access disparities result in lower uptake among socioeconomically disadvantaged and rural populations. In the United States, screening rates for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancers have risen overall since 1997, but persistent regional gaps—such as lower prevalence in the Southwest compared to the Northeast—highlight barriers like limited healthcare infrastructure and transportation in underserved areas. Addressing these inequities requires targeted public health interventions to ensure broad implementation of evidence-based guidelines.

### Population-Specific Recommendations

Screening recommendations for cancer vary significantly by age, gender, and other demographic factors to balance benefits and risks. For prostate cancer, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) assigns a Grade D recommendation against routine prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening in men aged 70 years and older, citing limited benefits and potential harms from overdiagnosis and overtreatment. In contrast, for men aged 55 to 69 years, the USPSTF recommends individualized decision-making after discussing potential benefits and harms with a clinician, reflecting ongoing debate about PSA's net value in this group. For cervical cancer, the USPSTF advises screening with cervical cytology (Pap test) every three years for women aged 21 to 29 years, transitioning to primary high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) testing every five years or co-testing (HPV and cytology) every five years for those aged 30 to 65 years, with screening cessation after age 65 for those with adequate prior negative results.

Regional variations in screening protocols account for differences in cancer incidence and population-specific risks. In Japan, where breast cancer incidence is rising but mortality remains lower than in Western countries, the national breast cancer screening program recommends biennial mammography starting at age 40 for women up to age 69, with no strict upper age limit but active encouragement through age 74 to address dense breast tissue prevalence in Asian populations. For gastric cancer, which has high incidence in East Asian countries like Japan, Korea, and parts of China, guidelines from the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) and others recommend population-based endoscopic screening in high-risk regions, typically starting at age 40 to 50 and performed every 2 to 3 years, as endoscopy allows direct visualization and biopsy of precancerous lesions like intestinal metaplasia. The American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) similarly endorses endoscopic screening for immigrants from high-incidence areas or those with relevant risk factors, emphasizing its superiority over non-invasive tests like serology in detecting early-stage disease.

Individuals at elevated risk due to family history require tailored, earlier interventions. For colorectal cancer in those with a family history suggestive of Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer), the AGA recommends initiating colonoscopy screening every one to two years beginning at age 20 to 25 years, or two to five years before the earliest diagnosed family member's age, to detect and remove premalignant polyps given the syndrome's accelerated carcinogenesis. This approach has been shown to significantly reduce colorectal cancer incidence and mortality in affected families through vigilant surveillance.

The USPSTF maintains its recommendation for annual low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening in adults aged 50 to 80 years with a 20-pack-year smoking history who currently smoke or quit within the past 15 years. Emerging 2025 research, such as the LC-SHIELD study presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) annual meeting, demonstrates the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance lung cancer screening efficiency, with AI software serving as the initial reader to prioritize suspicious nodules and reduce radiologist workload without compromising sensitivity in high-risk never-smokers. This AI integration aims to improve early detection rates, potentially lowering mortality by facilitating faster triage in resource-limited settings.

### Genetic Testing for Risk Assessment

Genetic testing for cancer risk assessment involves analyzing an individual's germline DNA to identify inherited variants that predispose to cancer development, enabling personalized prevention strategies. This process typically begins with genetic counseling to evaluate family and personal history, followed by targeted or comprehensive testing. Multigene panel tests, which sequence multiple cancer susceptibility genes simultaneously using next-generation sequencing, have become standard for assessing hereditary risks, particularly for breast, ovarian, colorectal, and other cancers. These panels often include genes such as *BRCA1*, *BRCA2*, and *TP53*, where pathogenic variants confer significantly elevated lifetime risks—for instance, *BRCA1/2* variants increase breast cancer risk to 55-72% and ovarian cancer risk to 39-44%.

Direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic testing kits, such as those offered by 23andMe, provide an accessible entry point for risk assessment by screening for select variants in genes like *BRCA1/2*, though they are limited in scope and do not cover all known pathogenic mutations. These tests report on a subset of variants (e.g., up to 44 in *BRCA1/2* for certain populations), potentially missing up to 90% of risk-associated changes in diverse groups, and results should be confirmed through clinical-grade testing. Following identification of a pathogenic variant in a proband (the first family member tested), cascade testing extends screening to at-risk relatives, systematically offering targeted testing to first-degree family members and beyond, which can identify carriers at a population level and facilitate early interventions.

Ethical considerations in genetic testing include potential psychological impacts, such as anxiety or distress from learning one's risk, which may affect mental health and family dynamics, necessitating pre- and post-test counseling. Concerns about insurance discrimination persist despite protections under the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) of 2008, which prohibits health insurers from using genetic information for coverage decisions or premiums and employers from employment discrimination based on genetics, though gaps remain for life and disability insurance. In high-risk families meeting criteria like those from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, the yield of positive pathogenic variants ranges from 10-20%, informing decisions on prophylactic measures such as risk-reducing surgeries (e.g., mastectomy for *BRCA* carriers) or enhanced screening protocols.

## Treatment

### Surgical Interventions

Surgical interventions remain a cornerstone of cancer treatment, primarily aimed at removing malignant tumors and achieving local control of the disease. These procedures are most effective when the cancer is localized and can be completely excised, serving both curative and palliative purposes depending on the stage and type of malignancy. The choice of surgical approach is influenced by factors such as tumor location, size, and patient health status, with the goal of maximizing oncologic outcomes while minimizing morbidity.

Curative resection involves the complete removal of the primary tumor along with a margin of healthy tissue to eliminate all detectable cancer cells, often applied in early-stage solid tumors like breast or colorectal cancer. For instance, mastectomy is a common curative procedure for breast cancer, where the entire breast tissue is excised to prevent recurrence. Debulking surgery, in contrast, reduces the bulk of an inoperable tumor to alleviate symptoms or facilitate subsequent therapies, particularly in advanced ovarian or pancreatic cancers where full resection is not feasible. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is a targeted diagnostic and staging technique that identifies the first lymph node draining the tumor site, allowing for selective removal and avoiding unnecessary full lymphadenectomy; it is widely used in breast and melanoma cases to assess metastasis risk.

Minimally invasive techniques, such as laparoscopy, have revolutionized cancer surgery by employing small incisions and endoscopic tools to access and excise tumors, leading to reduced postoperative pain, shorter hospital stays, and faster recovery times compared to open surgery. In colorectal cancer procedures, laparoscopic approaches have demonstrated equivalent oncologic outcomes to traditional methods while decreasing recovery time by several days. These techniques are particularly beneficial in abdominal and pelvic cancers, though they require specialized training and may not suit all tumor anatomies.

Despite advancements, surgical interventions carry risks of complications, including infections at the surgical site, which can occur in up to 5-10% of cases and are exacerbated by factors like immunosuppression or poor wound care. Lymphedema, a chronic swelling due to lymphatic disruption, is a notable sequela following axillary lymph node dissection in breast cancer surgery, affecting quality of life in approximately 20% of patients. Other potential issues include bleeding, organ injury, and delayed wound healing, with overall complication rates varying by procedure complexity.

In multimodal therapy, surgery often integrates with other treatments; for example, neoadjuvant surgery following preoperative chemotherapy can downstage rectal cancer, enabling sphincter-preserving resections and improving local control rates. Staging assessments, such as imaging or biopsies, inform the surgical plan by delineating tumor extent and guiding the scope of intervention.

### Chemotherapy

Chemotherapy involves the use of cytotoxic drugs designed to target and kill rapidly dividing cancer cells by interfering with essential cellular processes such as DNA replication and cell division. These agents are administered systemically, often intravenously or orally, and are a cornerstone of cancer treatment for many malignancies, either as primary therapy, adjuvant to surgery, or in combination with other modalities. While effective in reducing tumor burden, chemotherapy's non-specific action can also affect healthy proliferating cells, leading to a range of toxicities.

Chemotherapeutic drugs are classified into several major categories based on their mechanisms of action. Alkylating agents, such as cyclophosphamide, work by adding alkyl groups to DNA, causing cross-links that prevent strand separation and halt replication; they are particularly active in the G1 phase of the cell cycle and are used against a broad spectrum of cancers including lymphomas and breast cancer. Antimetabolites, exemplified by 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), mimic natural metabolites to incorporate into DNA or RNA, disrupting synthesis and primarily affecting cells in the S phase; 5-FU is commonly employed in colorectal and breast cancers. Topoisomerase inhibitors, like etoposide, block the enzymes that relieve DNA supercoiling during replication, leading to DNA breaks and cell death, with activity across phases but maximal in S and G2; etoposide is a key agent in treating lung cancer and lymphomas.

Standard regimens combine multiple agents to enhance efficacy and overcome resistance through synergistic effects. The CHOP regimen, consisting of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone, is a widely used combination for non-Hodgkin lymphoma, typically administered in cycles every 21 days for 4-6 courses, achieving cure rates exceeding 60% in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma when combined with rituximab as R-CHOP. For breast cancer, the neoadjuvant AC-T regimen—doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel—is employed to shrink tumors prior to surgery, improving rates of breast-conserving procedures and pathologic complete response in up to 20-30% of patients with triple-negative or HER2-positive disease.

Common side effects of chemotherapy include myelosuppression, which manifests as reduced production of blood cells leading to anemia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia, increasing infection risk; this is most pronounced 7-14 days post-treatment with agents like cyclophosphamide. Nausea and vomiting affect up to 70% of patients, often triggered by drugs such as doxorubicin, and can be acute or delayed. Management strategies include granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) analogs like filgrastim, which stimulate neutrophil production and reduce febrile neutropenia incidence by 50% when given prophylactically in high-risk regimens. Antiemetics such as ondansetron are standard for nausea control, alongside supportive care like hydration and dietary adjustments.

Drug resistance poses a major challenge to chemotherapy efficacy, with multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1, or P-glycoprotein) acting as an ATP-dependent efflux pump that expels chemotherapeutic agents from cancer cells, reducing intracellular drug accumulation and contributing to treatment failure in up to 50% of advanced cases. Overexpression of MDR1, often induced by prior exposure or genetic factors, confers cross-resistance to multiple drugs including anthracyclines and taxanes. Recent advances in 2024-2025 have focused on nanoparticle-based delivery systems to circumvent resistance; these carriers, such as lipid nanoparticles encapsulating doxorubicin, enhance tumor penetration via the enhanced permeability and retention effect, improve drug bioavailability, and reduce efflux by MDR1 through surface modifications like PEGylation, showing up to 2-3 fold increased efficacy in preclinical models of resistant breast and lung cancers. Clinical trials in 2025 are evaluating these systems to minimize systemic toxicity while targeting residual disease post-surgery.

### Radiation Therapy

Radiation therapy, also known as radiotherapy, utilizes high-energy rays or particles, such as X-rays, gamma rays, or protons, to damage the DNA of cancer cells, thereby inhibiting their growth and division or inducing cell death. This localized treatment targets specific areas of the body, minimizing exposure to surrounding healthy tissues when advanced techniques are employed. It is commonly used as a primary treatment, adjuvant therapy following surgery, or palliative measure to alleviate symptoms in various cancers, including those of the breast, prostate, head and neck, and cervix.

The two primary types of radiation therapy are external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) and brachytherapy. EBRT delivers radiation from an external machine that directs beams toward the tumor, with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) representing a precise form that uses computer-controlled adjustments to vary beam intensity and shape, allowing higher doses to the tumor while sparing adjacent normal tissues. For instance, IMRT employs thin, computer-generated beams based on 3D tumor imaging to conform the radiation dose closely to the tumor's contours. Brachytherapy, in contrast, involves placing radioactive sources directly inside or near the tumor; low-dose-rate (LDR) implants, such as permanent radioactive seeds in the prostate, provide continuous low-level radiation over months, effectively treating localized prostate cancer with reduced impact on surrounding structures.

Dosing in radiation therapy is measured in gray (Gy), the unit of absorbed radiation, and typically delivered in fractions over multiple sessions to balance efficacy and toxicity. A common regimen for breast cancer following lumpectomy involves whole-breast irradiation of 45-50 Gy administered in 25 daily fractions over five weeks, often with an optional tumor bed boost of 10-16 Gy in additional fractions to enhance local control. These fractionated schedules allow normal tissues time to repair between treatments, improving the therapeutic ratio.

Side effects of radiation therapy arise from damage to nearby healthy cells and are categorized as acute (occurring during or shortly after treatment) or late (developing months to years later). Acute effects include skin irritation resembling sunburn, fatigue, and temporary hair loss in the treated area, while late effects may involve fibrosis (scarring and tissue stiffening), lymphedema, or organ dysfunction such as xerostomia in head and neck treatments. Image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) enhances precision by using real-time imaging, such as X-rays or CT scans, to verify tumor position before each fraction, thereby reducing doses to critical organs like the heart or lungs and mitigating both acute and late toxicities. Radiation therapy is sometimes combined with chemotherapy to improve tumor response in certain cancers, though this section focuses on radiation modalities.

Recent advances include proton therapy, which uses protons rather than photons (X-rays) to deliver radiation with a sharp dose fall-off beyond the tumor, minimizing exposure to distal tissues. In pediatric patients, proton therapy has demonstrated a lower incidence of severe side effects and secondary malignancies compared to traditional photon-based EBRT, with cohort studies showing reduced risks of second cancers due to decreased radiation scatter and integral dose to healthy tissues. This is particularly beneficial for children with brain tumors or sarcomas, where long-term survival amplifies the importance of avoiding treatment-induced cancers.

### Immunotherapy

Immunotherapy represents a transformative approach in cancer treatment by leveraging the patient's immune system to recognize and destroy malignant cells. Unlike conventional therapies, it enhances natural immune responses rather than directly targeting tumor cells, leading to durable remissions in subsets of patients across various cancer types. This modality has revolutionized oncology, particularly for hematologic malignancies and certain solid tumors, with ongoing research expanding its applications.

Checkpoint inhibitors, a cornerstone of immunotherapy, block inhibitory signals that tumors exploit to evade immune detection, thereby "releasing the brakes" on T-cells to mount an effective antitumor response. For instance, PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors like pembrolizumab prevent the interaction between programmed death-1 (PD-1) on T-cells and PD-L1 on tumor cells, restoring T-cell cytotoxicity. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved pembrolizumab in 2014 for unresectable or metastatic melanoma in patients who progressed on prior therapies, demonstrating objective response rates of approximately 33% in clinical trials.

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy involves genetically engineering a patient's T-cells to express receptors targeting specific tumor antigens, enabling precise immune attack. Axicabtagene ciloleucel, a CD19-directed CAR-T product, redirects T-cells against B-cell lymphomas, achieving complete remission rates of up to 54% in relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma. The FDA granted approval for axicabtagene ciloleucel in 2017 for adults after two or more lines of systemic therapy, with subsequent expansions in 2022 for second-line use. CAR-T mechanisms trigger rapid T-cell activation and proliferation upon antigen binding, but this can lead to cytokine release syndrome (CRS), a potentially severe toxicity managed primarily with tocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor antagonist, which resolves symptoms in most cases without compromising efficacy.

By 2025, immunotherapy approvals have broadened, including expansions for microsatellite instability-high (MSI-high) solid tumors; for example, the FDA approved the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab in April 2025 as first-line therapy for unresectable or metastatic MSI-high or mismatch repair-deficient colorectal cancer, building on prior single-agent uses. Response to immunotherapy is often predicted by tumor mutational burden (TMB), where tumors with TMB greater than 10 mutations per megabase (mut/Mb) generate more neoantigens, correlating with higher objective response rates to checkpoint inhibitors across solid tumors. Immunotherapy can complement targeted therapies by amplifying immune-mediated effects alongside molecular inhibition.

### Targeted Therapies

Targeted therapies represent a cornerstone of precision oncology, utilizing drugs or other agents designed to interfere with specific molecular targets that drive cancer cell proliferation, survival, or metastasis, thereby minimizing damage to healthy cells compared to traditional treatments. These therapies exploit genetic alterations or overexpressed proteins unique to cancer cells, such as mutated kinases or DNA repair deficiencies, to selectively inhibit tumor growth. For instance, small-molecule inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies are the primary classes, with the former penetrating cell membranes to block intracellular targets and the latter binding extracellularly to flag cancer cells or disrupt signaling.

A seminal example is imatinib (Gleevec), a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that specifically targets the BCR-ABL fusion protein resulting from the Philadelphia chromosome translocation in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), dramatically improving patient outcomes since its approval in 2001 by transforming a once-fatal disease into a manageable chronic condition with response rates exceeding 90% in early-stage patients. Similarly, PARP inhibitors like olaparib (Lynparza) exploit synthetic lethality in cancers with BRCA1/2 mutations, which impair homologous recombination repair; by inhibiting PARP enzymes involved in alternative DNA repair pathways, olaparib leads to unrepaired DNA damage and cell death, earning FDA approval in 2014 for maintenance therapy in BRCA-mutated advanced ovarian cancer, where it extended progression-free survival by over 7 months in clinical trials.

Precision in targeted therapy relies on companion diagnostics to identify eligible patients, such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assays detecting ALK gene rearrangements in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which guide the use of ALK inhibitors like crizotinib; FDA-approved FISH probes confirm ALK fusions in approximately 3-7% of NSCLC cases, enabling personalized treatment that improves median survival by up to 20 months. However, resistance often emerges through secondary mutations or pathway bypasses, exemplified by the T790M mutation in the EGFR gene, which confers resistance to first- and second-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors in about 50-60% of NSCLC patients; third-generation inhibitors like osimertinib, approved in 2015, overcome this by selectively targeting T790M-mutated EGFR while sparing wild-type forms, thereby restoring sensitivity in resistant cases.

As of 2025, advancements include bispecific antibodies that simultaneously engage tumor-specific antigens and immune effector cells or dual signaling pathways in solid tumors, enhancing tumor cell lysis with reduced off-target effects; for example, amivantamab, approved in 2021 for EGFR exon 20 insertion-mutated NSCLC, bispecifically targets EGFR and MET to address resistance mechanisms, while ongoing trials explore broader applications in colorectal and pancreatic cancers, showing objective response rates of 20-40% in refractory solid tumors. These developments underscore the evolving integration of targeted therapies with biomarker-driven strategies to combat heterogeneity and resistance in diverse cancers.

### Palliative Care

Palliative care in cancer focuses on alleviating symptoms and enhancing quality of life for patients with advanced disease, emphasizing comfort and support rather than cure. It addresses physical, emotional, and spiritual needs through a multidisciplinary approach, integrating medical, psychological, and social interventions tailored to the individual's stage of illness. Early involvement of palliative care teams can occur alongside active treatment, while in later stages, it transitions to comprehensive end-of-life support.

Key components of palliative care include effective pain management, often guided by the World Health Organization (WHO) analgesic ladder, which provides a stepwise framework for escalating treatment based on pain severity. The ladder starts with non-opioids such as acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for mild pain, progresses to weak opioids like codeine for moderate pain, and advances to strong opioids such as morphine for severe pain, with adjunct therapies like antidepressants or anticonvulsants as needed. This approach has been widely adopted for cancer pain relief, ensuring prompt oral administration and regular reassessment to maintain efficacy.

Nausea and vomiting, common in advanced cancer due to disease progression or treatments, are managed with antiemetics like ondansetron, a selective serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist. Ondansetron effectively prevents chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting by blocking serotonin release in the gut and central nervous system, typically administered at 8 mg doses before emetogenic stimuli. Clinical guidelines recommend it as a first-line agent for moderate to high emetic risk scenarios in cancer patients.

Psychosocial support forms a cornerstone of palliative care, addressing emotional distress, anxiety, depression, and family dynamics through counseling, support groups, and spiritual guidance. Interventions such as individual psychotherapy and peer-led groups help patients cope with existential concerns and improve mood, while caregiver support mitigates burden and enhances family resilience. Integrated psychosocial care has been shown to reduce mental health symptoms and foster better adjustment to illness.

For patients with end-stage cancer, hospice care integrates seamlessly into palliative services, providing holistic comfort-focused support in the final months of life. Hospice emphasizes symptom control, emotional care, and dignity, often delivered at home or in specialized facilities, with interdisciplinary teams including nurses, social workers, and chaplains. This model reduces aggressive interventions and promotes peaceful transitions, improving outcomes for both patients and families.

Integrating palliative care early in the course of advanced cancer yields significant benefits, including improved quality of life and mood, as demonstrated in randomized trials. Landmark studies, such as the 2010 trial in metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer, reported a median survival extension of approximately 2.7 months with early palliative care compared to standard oncology care alone. More recent evidence confirms these gains, attributing them to better symptom management, prognostic understanding, and reduced depression.

Cultural variations influence palliative care preferences, particularly regarding location of end-of-life care, with many patients favoring home-based support to align with family-oriented values. In diverse populations, such as those in low- and middle-income countries, a majority express a preference for dying at home over hospital settings, though access barriers like resource limitations can shift outcomes toward institutional care. These differences underscore the need for culturally sensitive discussions to honor individual and communal priorities in care planning.

## Prognosis

### Prognostic Factors

Prognostic factors in cancer refer to characteristics that help predict the likely course and outcome of the disease for an individual patient, guiding clinical decision-making and personalized care. These factors encompass tumor biology, patient demographics, molecular markers, and external influences, often integrated into predictive models to estimate survival probabilities. Staging systems, such as the TNM classification, serve as a foundational prognostic element by assessing tumor extent, node involvement, and metastasis.

Tumor-related factors are among the most established predictors of cancer outcomes. Tumor grade evaluates the degree of abnormality in cancer cells under a microscope, with higher grades (indicating more aggressive, poorly differentiated cells) associated with faster growth and poorer prognosis across various cancers, such as breast and prostate malignancies. Stage at diagnosis remains a dominant factor, where early-stage cancers (localized without spread) generally yield better survival rates compared to advanced stages involving metastasis. Surgical margins, the edges of tissue removed during resection, also influence prognosis; negative margins (no cancer cells at the edge) correlate with lower recurrence risk, while positive margins increase the likelihood of local relapse, particularly in breast and colorectal cancers.

Patient-specific factors significantly modulate prognosis by reflecting overall health and resilience to treatment. Age is a key determinant, with older patients often facing worse outcomes due to reduced physiological reserve and higher vulnerability to therapy side effects, as evidenced in lung and pancreatic cancers. Comorbidities, quantified by tools like the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), further refine predictions; a higher CCI score, incorporating conditions such as diabetes or cardiovascular disease, is linked to increased mortality risk in cancer patients, independent of tumor characteristics.

Molecular and genetic markers provide deeper insights into tumor behavior and treatment response. In colorectal cancer, KRAS wild-type status is a favorable prognostic indicator, associated with improved survival and better responsiveness to therapies like anti-EGFR antibodies, compared to KRAS-mutated tumors that exhibit more aggressive progression.

Socioeconomic factors indirectly shape prognosis by affecting timely access to care. Limited healthcare access, often tied to lower socioeconomic status, can delay diagnosis and lead to presentation at more advanced stages, thereby worsening overall outcomes in cancers like cervical and breast.

To integrate these diverse factors, nomograms are widely used as graphical tools for individualized risk assessment. These models combine variables like stage, grade, age, and molecular markers to generate personalized probability estimates for outcomes such as recurrence or survival, enhancing precision in prognostication for cancers including prostate and breast.

### Survival Statistics and Outcomes

Survival rates for cancer vary widely depending on the type, stage at diagnosis, and access to treatment. The 5-year relative survival rate, which compares the survival of cancer patients to that of the general population, serves as a key metric for assessing outcomes. For instance, prostate cancer has a high 5-year relative survival rate of 97.9%, largely due to effective early detection and localized treatments. In contrast, pancreatic cancer has a much lower rate of 13.3%, reflecting challenges in early diagnosis and limited therapeutic options. Female breast cancer falls in between, with a 91.7% 5-year relative survival rate, benefiting from advances in screening and targeted therapies. These figures, based on U.S. data from 2015–2021, illustrate the spectrum of outcomes across cancer types, where early-stage detection often correlates with survival exceeding 90% for many solid tumors.

Global trends in cancer survival have shown steady improvements since 1990, driven by enhanced screening programs, reduced tobacco use, and innovations in treatment. In high-income countries like the United States, the overall 5-year relative survival rate for all cancers combined rose from approximately 50% in the early 1990s to around 70% by 2020, representing a significant gain attributed to better prevention and multimodal therapies. Worldwide, age-standardized cancer mortality rates have declined by about one-third from 1990 to 2021, reflecting broader progress in early intervention and care, though aggregate 5-year survival data remain heterogeneous due to varying data quality across regions. These advancements have particularly benefited common cancers such as breast and colorectal, where survival increases of 10–20 percentage points have been observed in many developed nations over this period.33326-3/fulltext)

Disparities in survival outcomes persist between high-income and low-income countries, exacerbating global inequities in cancer care. For cervical cancer, the 5-year net survival rate reaches 68% in the United States but drops to as low as 19–23% in low-income settings like Uganda and Gambia, primarily due to limited access to screening, vaccination, and timely treatment. In low- and middle-income countries, overall cancer survival is often 20–30% lower than in high-income counterparts, stemming from infrastructure gaps, delayed diagnoses, and fewer resources for advanced therapies. These gaps highlight the need for targeted international efforts to improve equity.

Recent developments, particularly in immunotherapy, have notably enhanced outcomes for specific cancers like melanoma. By 2025, combination immunotherapy regimens, such as nivolumab plus ipilimumab, have boosted the 5-year survival rate for advanced melanoma to approximately 50%, with about half of responders remaining cancer-free at 10 years. This marks a dramatic shift from historical rates below 20% for metastatic disease, underscoring the transformative impact of immune checkpoint inhibitors on long-term survival.

## Epidemiology

### Global Incidence and Prevalence

In 2022, an estimated 20 million new cancer cases were diagnosed worldwide, excluding non-melanoma skin cancers, marking a significant global health challenge. Lung cancer was the most commonly diagnosed, accounting for approximately 2.5 million cases or 12.4% of the total, followed closely by breast cancer with about 2.3 million cases or 11.6%. Other prevalent types included colorectal (1.9 million), prostate (1.5 million), and stomach (nearly 1 million) cancers. These figures highlight the diverse burden across cancer sites, with incidence rates varying substantially by region; for instance, liver cancer incidence is notably high in Eastern Asia due to endemic hepatitis B virus infection, while cervical cancer predominates in sub-Saharan Africa owing to human papillomavirus prevalence and limited screening.

The global prevalence of cancer, defined as the number of individuals alive within five years of diagnosis, reached approximately 53.5 million in 2022, reflecting improved survival rates in high-income countries alongside rising diagnoses elsewhere. This prevalence underscores the long-term societal impact, as many survivors require ongoing care for treatment side effects or recurrence risks. Projections indicate a sharp escalation in incidence, with an estimated 35 million new cases by 2050—a 77% increase from 2022 levels—driven primarily by population growth and aging demographics.

Key drivers of this rising incidence include the aging global population, which amplifies age-related cancer risks, and increasing tobacco use in low- and middle-income countries, where over 80% of the projected case increase is anticipated. Additional contributors encompass rising rates of obesity, physical inactivity, and environmental exposures, particularly in transitioning economies. These patterns emphasize the need for targeted prevention strategies to mitigate the expanding burden in vulnerable regions.

### Mortality Trends and Disparities

Cancer mortality remains a significant global health challenge, with an estimated 9.7 million deaths attributed to the disease in 2022. This figure underscores the burden, particularly as lung cancer accounted for 1.8 million deaths, representing the leading cause, followed by colorectal cancer with approximately 900,000 deaths. These statistics highlight how tobacco-related and diet-influenced cancers dominate fatalities, with projections indicating a rise to approximately 18.5 million annual deaths by 2050, a 90% increase from 2022 levels, if current trends persist without intensified interventions.

In high-income countries, such as the United States, age-standardized cancer mortality rates have declined by about 34% from 1991 to 2022, driven by improvements in early detection, treatment efficacy, and public health measures. For instance, in the United States, overall cancer death rates fell by 34% from their 1991 peak through 2022, averting over 4.5 million deaths. Similar declines are observed in other high-income countries. Conversely, in low- and middle-income countries, mortality rates are increasing, with cancer deaths expected to rise by 146% in low human development index (HDI) nations by 2050 compared to a 57% increase in very high HDI countries, reflecting growing incidence and resource constraints. Cancer mortality closely ties to global incidence patterns, where rising cases in transitioning economies exacerbate fatalities.

Disparities in cancer mortality are pronounced, particularly along racial and geographic lines. In the United States, Black Americans face approximately 20% higher overall cancer mortality rates than White Americans, a gap persisting despite declines in death rates for both groups—49% for Black men and 33% for Black women from 1991 to 2022. This inequity stems from barriers in screening, treatment access, and socioeconomic factors, with Black individuals showing 16% higher mortality than Whites in recent years despite similar or lower incidence for some cancers. Rural-urban divides further compound these issues, as rural residents experience higher mortality rates—such as 14% elevated colorectal cancer deaths compared to urban areas—due to limited healthcare infrastructure, transportation challenges, and delayed diagnoses.

Key interventions, notably tobacco control policies, have substantially mitigated mortality by targeting a risk factor responsible for about 25% of cancer deaths worldwide. Comprehensive strategies, including smoking cessation programs and regulations, have averted nearly 4 million lung cancer deaths in the United States alone since 1990, accounting for over 50% of the overall decline in cancer mortality. Such efforts demonstrate the potential for public health measures to narrow global and domestic disparities when equitably implemented.

## History

### Early Concepts and Discoveries

The earliest documented descriptions of cancer appear in ancient Egyptian medical texts, particularly the Edwin Smith Papyrus, which dates to around 3000 BCE and details eight cases of breast tumors characterized as "bulging masses" that were cool to the touch and untreatable, with no effective interventions proposed beyond observation. This papyrus, likely a copy of even older writings, reflects an empirical approach to diagnosis through visual and manual examination but offers no curative measures, viewing such tumors as grave and inevitable.

In ancient Greece, circa 400 BCE, Hippocrates advanced early concepts of cancer within his humoral theory, positing that the disease arose from an imbalance of the body's four humors—blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile—with excess black bile leading to the formation of hard, invasive tumors. He coined the term "carcinoma" (from the Greek *karkinos*, meaning crab) to describe the crab-like extensions of veins surrounding these growths, distinguishing benign from malignant forms and rejecting supernatural causes in favor of natural imbalances treatable through diet, purgatives, and cautery. This framework dominated medical thought for centuries, influencing perceptions of cancer as a systemic disorder rather than a localized affliction.

During the Middle Ages, Islamic physician Avicenna (Ibn Sina) built upon humoral ideas in his influential *Canon of Medicine* (completed around 1025 CE), classifying cancer as an "atrabilious" swelling rooted in corrupted black bile and recommending surgical excision for accessible, non-ulcerated tumors to prevent spread, while cautioning against operations on advanced cases due to risks of dissemination. His text emphasized preoperative assessment and postoperative care, marking a shift toward more systematic surgical approaches in pre-modern medicine.

The 18th and 19th centuries saw folk remedies persist alongside emerging scientific inquiry, with common treatments including herbal poultices made from plants like hemlock or rhubarb applied to tumors to draw out supposed poisons, often combined with incantations in traditional practices. Surgical interventions, such as mastectomies for breast cancer, were performed without anesthesia using crude tools like knives and cauterizing irons, as exemplified by procedures in the early 1800s that caused excruciating pain and high mortality from infection. These methods highlighted the era's limitations in pain management and antisepsis.

A pivotal shift occurred in 1858 when Rudolf Virchow published *Cellular Pathology*, using microscopy to demonstrate that cancer originates from the abnormal proliferation of normal cells rather than humoral imbalances, establishing the cellular basis of the disease and laying groundwork for modern oncology. Virchow's observation that "every cell comes from a cell" (*omnis cellula e cellula*) applied directly to tumors, transforming cancer from a mystical or fluid-based entity into a pathological process rooted in tissue derangement.

### Modern Developments and Milestones

In the mid-20th century, the discovery of chemotherapy marked a pivotal shift in cancer treatment. During World War II, researchers observed that exposure to nitrogen mustard, a chemical warfare agent, suppressed white blood cell production, leading to its experimental use against lymphomas in the 1940s. In 1942, pharmacologists Louis Goodman and Alfred Gilman at Yale University administered the first dose of nitrogen mustard to a patient with advanced lymphoma, achieving tumor regression and establishing the proof-of-concept for systemic chemotherapy. This breakthrough, formalized with FDA approval of mechlorethamine in 1949, laid the foundation for modern chemotherapeutic regimens.

Sidney Farber, often called the father of modern chemotherapy, advanced these efforts in pediatric oncology. In the late 1940s, Farber pioneered the use of folic acid antagonists like aminopterin to treat childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), achieving the first temporary remissions in 10 of 16 severely ill children by November 1947. His work at Children's Hospital Boston not only demonstrated chemotherapy's potential in leukemia but also spurred the creation of the Jimmy Fund in 1948 to support such research.

Another landmark in the 20th century was the U.S. government's intensified commitment to cancer research. On December 23, 1971, President Richard Nixon signed the National Cancer Act, declaring a "war on cancer" that expanded the National Cancer Institute's authority, increased funding to $100 million annually, and fostered interdisciplinary collaborations. This legislation accelerated progress in epidemiology, treatment, and prevention, influencing global oncology efforts.

In the 1970s and 1980s, cytogenetic discoveries illuminated cancer's genetic basis. In 1973, Janet Rowley demonstrated that the Philadelphia chromosome in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), first identified in 1960, results from a consistent translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22. Her subsequent work uncovered additional translocations, such as t(8;21) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and t(15;17) in acute promyelocytic leukemia, demonstrating how these rearrangements drive oncogenesis and enabling targeted diagnostics.

The link between human papillomavirus (HPV) and cervical cancer emerged in the 1980s through Harald zur Hausen's research. In 1983, zur Hausen and colleagues isolated HPV-16 from cervical cancer biopsies, followed by HPV-18 in 1984, proving these high-risk types integrate into host DNA to cause most cervical carcinomas. This discovery, awarded the 2008 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, paved the way for prophylactic vaccines approved in 2006.

The 1990s brought breakthroughs in hereditary cancer risks with the identification of BRCA genes. In 1994, researchers cloned and sequenced BRCA1 on chromosome 17, linking mutations to elevated breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility. BRCA2, mapped to chromosome 13, was identified in 1995, revealing similar risks and enabling genetic screening for high-risk families. These findings revolutionized preventive strategies, including prophylactic surgeries and targeted therapies like PARP inhibitors.

Entering the 21st century, targeted therapies transformed outcomes for specific cancers. Imatinib (Gleevec), a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, received FDA approval on May 10, 2001, for Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML, achieving complete cytogenetic responses in over 80% of chronic-phase patients and converting a fatal disease into a manageable one. This approval, based on rapid clinical trials, exemplified precision medicine by blocking the BCR-ABL fusion protein identified by Rowley's translocation work.

Genome editing tools further accelerated cancer research in the 2010s. The 2012 development of CRISPR-Cas9 by Jennifer Doudna, Emmanuelle Charpentier, and colleagues provided a precise method for gene knockout and modification, enabling high-throughput screening of cancer drivers and modeling of tumor suppressors like TP53 in cell lines. By facilitating loss-of-function studies, CRISPR has elucidated oncogene dependencies and supported immunotherapy designs.

By 2025, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy has seen widespread clinical adoption for hematologic malignancies. Approved products like tisagenlecleucel and axicabtagene ciloleucel have treated over 20,000 patients globally since 2017, with complete remission rates exceeding 50% in relapsed B-cell lymphomas; manufacturing expansions and reduced costs have broadened access, projecting a market surpassing $7 billion annually.

Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have also reshaped cancer pathology by 2025. AI algorithms now analyze digital histopathology slides to detect micrometastases in breast and prostate cancers with accuracy comparable to expert pathologists, reducing diagnostic times by up to 30% and identifying biomarkers like PD-L1 expression for immunotherapy selection. Tools integrated into routine workflows, such as those from Paige.AI, enhance precision in over 100 U.S. labs, improving equity in underserved regions.

## Societal Impact

### Economic and Healthcare Burden

The economic burden of cancer encompasses both direct medical costs, such as treatment and healthcare services, and indirect costs, primarily lost productivity from morbidity, premature mortality, and caregiving. A comprehensive 2023 analysis estimated the global economic cost of 29 major cancers from 2020 to 2050 at $25.2 trillion in international dollars (constant 2017 prices), equivalent to an annual tax of 0.55% on global gross domestic product. This projection highlights the escalating fiscal strain, with productivity losses due to premature mortality comprising the largest share—over 70% in high-income countries—while direct health expenditures and informal care costs account for the remainder. Cancer mortality trends, as detailed in epidemiological data, drive a substantial portion of these indirect costs by reducing workforce participation and economic output.

In terms of cost breakdown, direct medical expenses for cancer care, including diagnostics, surgery, chemotherapy, and supportive services, represented approximately 49% of the total global burden in 2020, while lost productivity accounted for around 33% and informal care for 18%, based on the analysis. For instance, in 2020, global direct costs from health expenditures were estimated at $152 billion, with productivity losses adding $103 billion and informal care $55 billion, underscoring how treatment demands strain healthcare systems while mortality impacts long-term economic vitality. More recent data indicate global spending on cancer medicines reached $223 billion in 2023, projected to increase to $409 billion by 2028 due to innovative therapies. In the United States, the annual economic cost of cancer exceeded $200 billion in 2020, encompassing both direct medical spending and indirect losses, with projections indicating a rise to over $245 billion by 2030 due to aging populations and advancing therapies.

High-cost innovative therapies exemplify the challenges in managing these expenses. Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy, approved for certain blood cancers, typically costs $400,000 or more per patient, excluding additional hospitalization and follow-up care that can push totals beyond $1 million. Such prices reflect manufacturing complexities and limited scalability, contributing disproportionately to overall treatment expenditures despite their potential for durable remissions.

Efforts to mitigate this burden include adopting value-based care models, which tie reimbursements to clinical outcomes and patient quality of life rather than service volume, as advocated by oncology frameworks to optimize resource allocation. Additionally, the increased availability of generic and biosimilar drugs has reduced costs for essential chemotherapies and supportive agents by up to 80% in some markets, easing financial pressures on healthcare systems and patients. These strategies aim to balance innovation with affordability, potentially curbing the projected growth in global cancer expenditures.

### Cultural and Social Dimensions

Cancer stigma often manifests as a fear of contagion, despite the disease's non-infectious nature, leading to social isolation and withdrawal from support networks among patients. Studies have shown a positive correlation between perceived stigma and subjective social isolation, with stigma contributing to feelings of shame and discrimination that exacerbate loneliness in cancer survivors. For instance, in cancer patients, stigma levels were significantly associated with higher isolation (β = 0.843, p \u003c 0.001). Media portrayals frequently reinforce these stigmas through narratives that depict cancer as a tragic or fatal condition, such as in films like *The Fault in Our Stars*, which emphasize young patients' untimely deaths and may foster fatalistic attitudes toward the disease. However, positive survivor narratives in shows like *Chasing Life* highlight resilience and full lives post-diagnosis, potentially normalizing experiences and reducing stigma.

Cancer diagnosis places considerable strain on family dynamics, often resulting in spousal tension and higher rates of marital dissolution, particularly for female patients. Research indicates that women with serious illnesses, including cancer, face a divorce or separation rate of 20.8%, compared to 2.9% for men, representing over a sixfold increased risk (P \u003c .001). This gender disparity underscores broader relational challenges, where partners may struggle with caregiving roles, emotional burdens, and changes in intimacy, leading to overall marital stress similar to general population rates of about 11.6% but amplified by the illness's demands.

Cultural variations significantly influence social support structures for cancer patients, with collectivist societies prioritizing family-based practical assistance over individualistic emphases on emotional autonomy. In collectivist cultures, such as those in Asia and Latin America, extended family networks provide tangible aid like meals and financial help, but caregivers may suppress their own emotional needs to avoid burdening the group. Conversely, individualistic societies like those in the United States focus on personal emotional disclosure, fostering empathy and reciprocal support but often limiting broader community involvement in daily care. Among Chinese American breast cancer survivors, for example, emotional restraint is common to prevent worry among relatives, contrasting with European Americans' preference for open discussions that strengthen bonds.

Advocacy movements have played a pivotal role in raising cancer awareness, exemplified by the pink ribbon campaign, which originated in 1991 when the Susan G. Komen Foundation distributed ribbons at its Race for the Cure event and evolved into a global symbol through efforts like Estée Lauder's 1992 distribution of 1.5 million ribbons alongside petitions for research funding. These initiatives have heightened public visibility and encouraged early detection, yet they face criticism for "pinkwashing," where companies exploit the symbol for profit without substantial contributions to prevention or research, such as marketing products containing potential carcinogens. Groups like Breast Cancer Action, which coined the term in 2002, advocate for transparency to ensure campaigns prioritize meaningful action over superficial marketing.

## Research Directions

### Advances in Therapies

In 2025, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have emerged as a pivotal advancement in targeted cancer therapy, particularly for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Sacituzumab govitecan, an ADC targeting TROP2, demonstrated significant efficacy in frontline treatment for advanced TNBC in the phase III ASCENT-03 trial, reducing the risk of disease progression or death by 38% compared to chemotherapy alone, with a median progression-free survival of 9.7 months versus 6.9 months. This approval by the FDA in late 2025 expanded its use to PD-1/PD-L1 ineligible patients, addressing a high-need population where traditional chemotherapy often falls short. Similarly, oncolytic viruses like talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC), an engineered herpes simplex virus, continue to show promise in melanoma treatment, with studies highlighting its role in combination regimens to overcome immunotherapy resistance, achieving sustained responses in advanced cases.

Combination therapies integrating immunotherapy (IO) with targeted agents have gained traction through ongoing trials, enhancing response rates in genetically defined cancers. For instance, sequential treatment starting with vemurafenib plus cobimetinib followed by atezolizumab has improved progression-free survival in BRAF V600-mutant melanoma, with the phase II ImmunoCobiVem trial reporting a hazard ratio of 0.55 for early switching from targeted to IO therapy, minimizing resistance development. These approaches, presented at ESMO 2025, underscore the synergy between immune activation and molecular targeting, though optimal sequencing remains under investigation.

Personalized medicine has advanced through tumor organoids, three-dimensional models derived from patient biopsies that enable ex vivo drug testing to predict therapeutic responses. In 2025, organoid platforms have facilitated precision oncology by screening ADCs and IO agents, with studies showing high concordance between organoid predictions and clinical outcomes in breast and colorectal cancers, allowing tailored regimens that avoid ineffective treatments. This technology addresses tumor heterogeneity, as organoids recapitulate microenvironmental resistance mechanisms, accelerating the shift from empirical to individualized therapies.

In November 2025, researchers at UCSF reported a breakthrough in targeting KRAS mutations, responsible for about 25% of all cancers, using a new approach that restores drug sensitivity and slows tumor growth by exploiting previously undruggable pathways. Additionally, Duke Health announced promising results from a breast cancer vaccine trial, demonstrating enhanced immune responses against tumor cells in early-stage patients, potentially reducing recurrence rates.

Despite these innovations, challenges persist in translating advances to clinical success, including drug resistance and toxicity profiles that limit broad applicability. Resistance mechanisms, such as adaptive signaling in targeted therapies, often emerge within months, necessitating sequential or adaptive trial designs. Toxicity from combinations, like immune-related adverse events and off-target effects of ADCs, affects up to 40% of patients, requiring vigilant management. Overall, phase III oncology trials succeed in approximately 50% of cases, highlighting the need for better biomarkers to improve efficacy and reduce failure rates.

### Innovations in Detection and Prevention

Innovations in multi-cancer early detection have advanced through blood-based tests that analyze cell-free DNA for epigenetic markers, such as methylation patterns, enabling the identification of over 50 cancer types with high sensitivity for many deadly forms in early stages. The Galleri test, developed by GRAIL, exemplifies this approach by detecting cancer signals in plasma and predicting their anatomical origin, with real-world data from approximately 35,000 individuals showing its potential to increase detection rates more than seven-fold when added to standard screenings. These tests address the limitations of organ-specific screenings by offering a non-invasive, pan-cancer strategy that could shift diagnosis toward earlier intervention.

In prevention, gene editing technologies like CRISPR/Cas9 are being explored to target oncogenic viruses, particularly human papillomavirus (HPV), which drives cervical and other cancers. Clinical trials, such as one evaluating BD114 for HPV treatment, assess the safety and efficacy of CRISPR/Cas9 in editing HPV genes to clear persistent infections and regress precancerous lesions. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that CRISPR-mediated knockout of HPV E6 and E7 oncogenes can effectively halt cervical carcinogenesis in vitro, paving the way for therapeutic clearance in high-risk populations. Additionally, microbiome modulation emerges as a strategy for colorectal cancer prevention by reversing dysbiosis through probiotics, prebiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation, which suppress epithelial proliferation and reduce DNA-damaging toxins. Gut microbiota interventions, including natural product-derived modulators, have shown promise in preclinical models by altering inflammation and metabolic pathways to lower CRC incidence.

Artificial intelligence and big data analytics are enhancing cancer risk stratification by integrating wearable device data, such as activity and physiological metrics, into predictive models that identify at-risk individuals before symptoms arise. Machine learning algorithms applied to wearable sensors enable real-time monitoring of lifestyle factors and biomarkers, improving personalized risk assessment for cancers like breast and colorectal. For instance, AI-driven models using data from fitness trackers and electronic health records have demonstrated high accuracy in forecasting cancer susceptibility by combining genetic and environmental variables, supporting proactive prevention in population health.

Ongoing 2025 clinical trials are advancing liquid biopsy applications for detecting minimal residual disease (MRD) post-treatment, using circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) to monitor recurrence in early-stage cancers. Trials at institutions like Mass General Brigham are evaluating ctDNA-based MRD assays, such as Haystack MRD, to guide adjuvant therapy decisions in colorectal and breast cancers, with breakthrough designations highlighting their sensitivity in stage II disease. These efforts, including presentations at ASCO 2025, underscore liquid biopsy's role in precision oncology by enabling dynamic surveillance and reducing overtreatment through molecular-level tumor detection.

## Cancer in Special Contexts

### Cancer During Pregnancy

Cancer during pregnancy, also known as pregnancy-associated cancer, occurs in approximately 1 in 1,000 pregnancies, with the incidence estimated at around 84 per 100,000 deliveries based on large-scale meta-analyses. The most common malignancies include breast cancer, accounting for about 1 in 3,000 pregnancies, as well as cervical cancer and malignant melanoma, which together represent over half of all cases. Diagnosis typically involves imaging and biopsies adapted to minimize fetal exposure, such as ultrasound or MRI without contrast, while avoiding unnecessary radiation-based scans unless essential.

Management requires a multidisciplinary approach involving oncologists, obstetricians, and neonatologists to balance maternal treatment needs with fetal safety. Surgery is generally safe across all trimesters, though it is preferably performed in the second or third trimester to reduce risks of miscarriage or preterm labor associated with anesthesia in the first trimester. Chemotherapy is typically avoided during the first trimester due to high risks of congenital malformations but can be administered after 14 weeks gestation, using standard regimens like anthracyclines and taxanes, with discontinuation 3 to 4 weeks before delivery to allow maternal bone marrow recovery and minimize neonatal toxicity. Radiation therapy is feasible with appropriate shielding to limit fetal exposure below 50 mGy, particularly for localized tumors away from the pelvis, and is often deferred if possible until postpartum.

Fetal risks from cancer treatments vary by gestational age and modality. Teratogenic effects from chemotherapy are low after the first trimester, with primary concerns being intrauterine growth restriction and low birth weight rather than structural anomalies; long-term follow-up shows no increased risk of childhood cancer in exposed offspring. Radiation poses risks of intellectual disability if exposure exceeds safe thresholds during organogenesis, but shielding mitigates this effectively. Regarding breastfeeding, it is contraindicated during active chemotherapy due to potential drug transfer into breast milk, but may resume after a washout period of 2 to 3 weeks post-treatment, depending on the agent, or from the unaffected breast in cases like unilateral breast cancer.

With multidisciplinary care, maternal outcomes are comparable to those in non-pregnant women of similar age and cancer stage, with overall survival rates exceeding 70% across common types like breast (around 90% at 5 years) and cervical cancer when treated promptly. Fetal and neonatal outcomes, while carrying elevated risks of preterm birth and growth issues (up to 40% incidence), achieve viability rates over 90% with close monitoring and timely interventions like antenatal corticosteroids. Delays in diagnosis or treatment, occurring in up to 65% of cases historically, underscore the need for heightened awareness to optimize both maternal and perinatal survival.

### Cancer in Non-Human Animals

Cancer occurs naturally across a wide range of non-human animals, including vertebrates and invertebrates. A comprehensive analysis of 16,049 necropsy records from 292 tetrapod species (mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians) revealed a median neoplasia prevalence of 4.89% (ranging from 0% to 62.86%) and malignancy prevalence of 3.20% (ranging from 0% to 40.95%). Mammals showed the highest rates, with 12% neoplasia and 7% malignancy, compared to 4% and 1.6% in sauropsids (birds and reptiles) and 1.2% and 0% in amphibians. These variations correlate positively with adult body mass (2.1% increase in neoplasia per log₁₀ gram) and somatic mutation rates (47.26% increase per substitution per year), while longer gestation periods are associated with reduced malignancy (−5.65% per log₁₀ month).

In domestic and companion animals, cancer is a leading cause of death, particularly in pets like dogs and cats, and serves as a cornerstone of comparative oncology to advance human research. Approximately 6 million dogs in the United States are affected by cancer each year, with a 25% lifetime risk and half of dogs over 10 years old developing the disease. Common canine cancers include lymphoma, osteosarcoma, mammary tumors, melanoma, and bladder cancer, which exhibit molecular parallels to human forms, such as *TP53* mutations in 38–50% of cases and *PIK3CA* alterations (e.g., A3140G) in about 30% of mammary tumors. Dogs provide a naturally occurring, immunocompetent model with shared environmental exposures, enabling faster evaluation of therapies like anti-PD-L1 antibodies, which have shown efficacy against metastatic melanoma in both species. Breed-specific risks, such as higher lymphoma incidence in Golden Retrievers, further enhance genomic studies due to genetic diversity across over 100 breeds.

Certain species demonstrate exceptional cancer resistance, offering evolutionary insights that challenge Peto's paradox—the expectation that larger, longer-lived animals should have higher cancer rates due to more cell divisions. Elephants carry up to 40 copies of the *TP53* tumor suppressor gene, compared to two in humans, which amplifies DNA damage response and apoptosis to suppress tumorigenesis despite their massive size. Naked mole rats (*Heterocephalus glaber*) produce high-molecular-weight hyaluronic acid that enforces stringent contact inhibition in cells, preventing uncontrolled proliferation, and they rarely develop cancer even in captivity. These mechanisms, identified through comparative genomic analyses across 223 mammalian species reporting neoplasia, inform human strategies like enhancing *TP53* function or hyaluronan-based therapies.

In wild animals, cancer influences population dynamics and conservation, often intensified by human-induced environmental changes such as pollution, habitat fragmentation, and climate shifts. Transmissible cancers, like the devil facial tumor disease in Tasmanian devils (*Sarcophilus harrisii*), have caused over 80% population decline since the 1990s by evading immune recognition and spreading via bites. Pollution-driven cases include elevated cancer rates in St. Lawrence beluga whales (*Delphinapterus leucas*), linked to contaminants like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and fibropapillomatosis in green sea turtles (*Chelonia mydas*), associated with viral infections in degraded habitats. These oncogenic pressures can reduce reproductive success, alter behaviors, and drive evolutionary adaptations, such as faster life histories, underscoring the need for wildlife monitoring and mitigation to preserve biodiversity.
