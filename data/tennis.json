  "content": "# Tennis\n\nTennis is a racket sport, originally known as lawn tennis, in which two players (singles) or two pairs of players (doubles) compete against each other by striking a felt-covered hollow rubber ball with rackets over a net into the opponent's court, with the objective of preventing the opponent from returning the ball legally. The game is played on a rectangular court measuring 78 feet (23.77 meters) in length and 27 feet (8.23 meters) in width for singles matches, or 36 feet (10.97 meters) for doubles, divided by a net suspended 3 feet (0.914 meters) high at the center.\n\nThe origins of tennis trace back to the 11th or 12th century in France, where it evolved from \"jeu de paume,\" a handball game played by monks against monastery walls or over a rope, with the name \"tennis\" likely deriving from the French word \"tenez,\" meaning \"take\" or \"receive,\" called by the server. Rackets were introduced in the 16th century, and the modern version of lawn tennis emerged in the 1870s in Britain, patented by Major Walter Clopton Wingfield in 1873 as an outdoor pastime on grass courts. The first major tournament, the Wimbledon Championships, was held in 1877 by the All England Club, marking the sport's formal organization, while international growth accelerated with the founding of the International Lawn Tennis Federation (now the International Tennis Federation, or ITF) on March 1, 1913, in Paris, which serves as the global governing body for the sport.\n\nTennis follows a unique scoring system where points are counted as love (0), 15, 30, and 40, with a game won by the first player to reach four points while leading by at least two; sets are typically won by the first to six games with a two-game margin, and matches in professional play are best of three sets for women and doubles or best of five for men in major events. The sport is governed internationally by the ITF, which oversees amateur and junior levels, while professional circuits are managed by the ATP Tour for men, established in 1972 to represent male players and organize over 60 tournaments annually, and the WTA Tour for women, founded in 1973 to promote gender equity and featuring around 50 events each year. The four Grand Slam tournaments—Australian Open (since 1905), French Open (Roland Garros, since 1891), Wimbledon (since 1877), and US Open (since 1881)—represent the pinnacle of the sport, drawing top professionals and awarding the most prestige and prize money.\n\nGlobally, tennis has seen surging participation, with over 106 million players worldwide as of 2024, a 25.6% increase in just five years, driven by its accessibility for health, social, and competitive benefits across all ages. Professional tennis also boasts massive audiences, with the WTA Tour reaching a record 1.1 billion viewers in 2024 and the ATP Tour's social media following exceeding 168 million. Recent developments, such as the introduction of off-court coaching effective from January 1, 2025, and the announcement in October 2025 that the ITF will rebrand as World Tennis in 2026, reflect ongoing efforts to modernize the game while preserving its traditions.\n\n## History\n\n### Predecessors\n\nThe game known as jeu de paume, or \"game of the palm,\" originated in 11th- or 12th-century France, where it was played by monks as a form of handball against monastery walls or over a rope strung across a courtyard. Initially an outdoor activity using bare hands to strike a ball made of cloth, hair, or wool, it evolved significantly over the centuries. By the late 14th century, play shifted indoors to enclosed monastery courtyards, and players began using gloves for protection, followed by short wooden paddles and, by the early 16th century, strung rackets that marked a pivotal advancement in the sport's technique and reach.\n\nKey features of jeu de paume included its distinctive indoor courts, which were four-walled enclosures with irregular dimensions, sloping penthouse roofs, and specific openings like the grille and tambour for strategic play involving rebounds off walls. The scoring system was complex, featuring points accumulated in increments leading to games and sets, with terminology such as \"love\" (possibly derived from the French \"l'oeuf,\" meaning egg, symbolizing zero due to its shape) and \"deuce\" (from \"à deux,\" indicating two points needed to win) that emphasized tactical depth through concepts like the \"chase,\" where points could be deferred based on ball placement. This game gained immense popularity among European royalty during the Renaissance, earning the moniker \"sport of kings\"; for instance, England's Henry VIII was an avid player who used the court at Hampton Court Palace, built by Cardinal Wolsey between 1526 and 1529, and reportedly played vigorously despite his size.\n\nJeu de paume spread from France to England in the late 14th century via Norman influences and gained further traction during the Tudor era, where it was adapted as \"real tennis\" and constructed in over 100 courts across the region by the 16th century. Its influence on modern tennis is evident in shared elements such as the net dividing the court, basic boundary concepts, and retained scoring terminology like \"love,\" \"deuce,\" and \"advantage,\" which were directly carried over from the ancient game's framework. This indoor precursor laid essential groundwork that would inform the outdoor adaptation of lawn tennis in the 19th century.\n\n### Origins of modern tennis\n\nModern lawn tennis emerged in the late 19th century as an outdoor adaptation of earlier indoor racket sports like real tennis. In December 1873, Major Walter Clopton Wingfield, a Welsh army officer, invented the game under the name \"sphairistikè\"—derived from the Greek word for \"playing at ball\"—and patented it in 1874 as a portable lawn game for the upper classes. The original setup featured an hourglass-shaped court on grass, with a net raised to about 4 feet 8 inches at the posts and service boxes marked by additional lines, emphasizing portability and social play during summer garden parties.\n\nBy 1875, inconsistencies in Wingfield's design prompted standardization efforts, led by the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), which served as the governing body for emerging sports in England. The MCC revised the rules to create a rectangular court measuring 78 feet in length and 27 feet in width for singles matches, with the net lowered to 3 feet 6 inches at the center and service lines adjusted accordingly. These changes, influenced by real tennis traditions, established the foundational scoring system—15, 30, 40, game—and promoted uniform play, shifting the game from a novelty to a structured sport.\n\nThe sport's popularity surged with the inaugural Wimbledon Championships in 1877, organized by the All England Croquet and Lawn Tennis Club to fund a new roller for its lawns. Held on July 9–16 at the club's grounds in Wimbledon, London, the men's singles event drew 22 amateur gentlemen competitors, with Spencer Gore winning the final on a grass court using the new standardized dimensions. This tournament marked the first official lawn tennis championship and solidified the sport's rules and prestige among British elites.\n\nLawn tennis rapidly spread beyond Britain, reaching the United States in 1874 when Mary Ewing Outerbridge imported equipment from Bermuda and established the first court at the Staten Island Cricket and Baseball Club. To organize growing competitions, the United States National Lawn Tennis Association (USNLTA, now the USTA) was formed on May 21, 1881, by representatives from 33 clubs, standardizing rules and launching the U.S. National Championships (now the US Open) that year. Internationally, the sport's governance advanced with the creation of the International Lawn Tennis Federation (ILTF, now the ITF) on March 1, 1913, in Paris, uniting 15 national associations to oversee global rules and competitions.\n\nA significant rule evolution came in the 1970s amid the Open Era's push for faster, more spectator-friendly play. The tiebreak—a method to decide sets reaching 6-6 by playing to seven points with a two-point margin—was invented by James Van Alen in the 1950s but first adopted in major tournaments at the 1970 US Open, where it was used in all sets except the final one to avoid prolonged matches. Wimbledon followed suit in 1971 for all sets except the final, and by the mid-1970s, tiebreaks became standard across professional circuits, reducing set durations and enhancing television appeal.\n\n## Equipment\n\n### Rackets\n\nA tennis racket consists of a frame comprising the head, an optional throat, and a handle, which is strung with strings to form the hitting surface. The head is the oval-shaped portion containing the strung area, the throat connects the head to the handle, and the handle provides the grip for the player. According to International Tennis Federation (ITF) rules, the racket's overall length must not exceed 73.7 cm (29.0 inches), and its overall width must not exceed 31.7 cm (12.5 inches), while the hitting surface dimensions are limited to a maximum length of 39.4 cm (15.5 inches) and width of 29.2 cm (11.5 inches).\n\nThe evolution of tennis rackets began with wooden frames in the late 19th century, crafted from materials such as ash, maple, and hickory for durability and flexibility. These early rackets typically measured about 27 inches in length and weighed around 370-430 grams (13-15 ounces), offering a balance of control but limited power due to their smaller head sizes of approximately 65 square inches. Mass production using laminated veneers emerged in the 1940s, standardizing the design, though wooden rackets remained dominant until the 1960s. The shift to metal frames occurred in the mid-20th century, with René Lacoste patenting a steel racket in 1953; the Wilson T-2000, introduced in 1967 and popularized by Jimmy Connors, featured a steel frame with twin shafts for enhanced stiffness and power while maintaining a similar 27-inch length.\n\nBy the 1970s, composite materials revolutionized racket design, with graphite (carbon fiber) frames emerging as a lighter and stiffer alternative to wood and metal. Development of composites began in the 1960s, but widespread adoption followed in the 1970s, allowing for head sizes up to 40% larger than traditional wooden models and weights reduced by about 30%, typically to 300-350 grams unstrung. The ITF established head size limits in 1979 to regulate these innovations, capping the strung area at 100 square inches for competitive play. Modern rackets predominantly use carbon fiber reinforced with fiberglass or Kevlar for the frame, providing high strength-to-weight ratios and customizable stiffness.\n\nContemporary rackets feature grip circumferences ranging from 4 to 4.5 inches, with common sizes including 4 1/4 inches for average women's hands and 4 3/8 inches for men, ensuring ergonomic handling and reducing injury risk. Balance points are often head-light, with the center of mass shifted toward the handle (typically 6-7 points head-light, or 31-32 cm from the butt cap), to enhance maneuverability and control during volleys and serves. Customization options include string patterns, such as the open 16 mains by 19 crosses configuration, which facilitates greater spin potential by allowing more string movement on impact. Beam widths vary from 20 mm for control-oriented frames, which flex more for precision, to 25 mm for power-focused designs that store and release energy efficiently.\n\n### Strings\n\nTennis racket strings are essential components that directly influence a player's power, control, spin, and comfort during play. They are typically strung across the racket frame in a crisscross pattern, with the vertical strings known as mains and the horizontal ones as crosses. The choice of string material and setup significantly affects performance, with options ranging from traditional natural materials to modern synthetics designed for specific playing styles.\n\nNatural gut strings, derived from the serosa layer of cow intestines, offer exceptional elasticity and a soft feel that provides superior power and touch. These strings exhibit high tension maintenance, losing only about 5-8% of initial tension over time compared to higher losses in many synthetics, though they are prone to absorbing moisture in humid conditions, which can reduce performance. Despite their premium price—often exceeding $40 per set—natural gut remains favored by professionals for its unparalleled comfort and responsiveness, such as in Roger Federer's hybrid setup.\n\nSynthetic strings dominate modern tennis due to their affordability and versatility. Nylon-based synthetic gut strings are durable and budget-friendly, providing consistent play but with lower power output than natural gut. Polyester monofilament strings, often called \"poly,\" are stiffer and excel in generating spin through enhanced string snapback, making them popular among baseline players like Rafael Nadal, who uses Babolat RPM Blast for its control and durability. Multifilament synthetics, composed of thousands of fine fibers, mimic natural gut's softness and are arm-friendly, offering good power and comfort for players prone to elbow issues, though they wear faster than solid-core options.\n\nHybrid stringing combines different materials, typically natural gut in the mains for power and feel with synthetic strings (like polyester) in the crosses for added durability and spin control. This setup balances the strengths of both, extending the lifespan of expensive gut while maintaining playability, and is common among top players seeking optimized performance.\n\nThe stringing process involves applying tension between 45 and 65 pounds, with gauges ranging from 16 to 18 (approximately 1.19 to 1.30 mm in thickness). Thinner gauges (higher numbers) enhance feel and spin but reduce durability, while thicker ones prioritize longevity. Higher tensions improve control and precision by reducing string deflection on impact, whereas lower tensions boost power through greater trampoline effect.\n\n### Balls\n\nTennis balls are uniform yellow spheres constructed from a hollow rubber core covered in felt, adhering to strict specifications established by the International Tennis Federation (ITF). The ITF mandates a diameter of 6.54 to 6.86 cm (2.57 to 2.70 inches), a mass of 56 to 59.4 grams (2 to 2.1 ounces), and a bounce height of 135 to 147 cm (53 to 58 inches) when dropped from 100 inches onto concrete at a temperature of 20–25°C. The core is pressurized with air or gas to achieve consistent rebound, while the felt exterior—a blend of wool (typically 65–70%) and nylon—provides aerodynamic drag to moderate flight speed and enhances grip on racket strings and court surfaces for better spin control.\n\nBalls are categorized by felt thickness to suit different court surfaces: regular-duty balls feature thinner felt that wears faster on abrasive surfaces like clay, promoting lower, more controlled bounces, whereas extra-duty balls have denser, thicker felt for greater durability on harder, faster courts. These variations ensure optimal performance without altering the core standards, allowing the felt to interact briefly with court textures to influence trajectory and pace.\n\nPrior to the 1970s, tennis balls were predominantly white (or black on clay courts) for visibility against grass, but the ITF adopted optic yellow in 1972 after trials showed it was far more discernible on color television broadcasts. Pressurization of the rubber core emerged in the 1920s, revolutionizing bounce and velocity by maintaining internal pressure in sealed cans, a practice pioneered by companies like Penn.\n\nAltitude impacts ball dynamics due to thinner air reducing drag; for instance, at Denver's elevation of approximately 1,600 meters (5,280 feet), balls exhibit higher bounces and longer travel distances compared to sea level. In professional tournaments, to counteract wear and preserve uniformity, balls are replaced after the initial seven games and subsequently every nine games.\n\n## Gameplay\n\n### Court\n\nA tennis court is a rectangular playing area measuring 78 feet (23.77 meters) in length and 27 feet (8.23 meters) in width for singles matches, while doubles matches utilize the full 36 feet (10.97 meters) in width by incorporating additional side areas known as tramlines. The court is divided equally by a net stretched across the width at the midpoint, with the playing area on each side bounded by baselines at the ends, parallel to the net.\n\nKey markings include the service line, positioned 21 feet (6.40 meters) from the net on each side, which extends across the court to define the service boxes; the center service line, running perpendicular from the net to the service line, splitting each half into right and left service courts; and sidelines that demarcate the boundaries for singles or doubles play. All lines are white and must be between 1 and 2 inches (2.5 to 5 centimeters) wide, except for the center service line and its center mark at the baseline, which are exactly 2 inches (5 centimeters) wide; these lines can be permanent fixtures on dedicated courts or temporary for events, with measurements taken to the outer edges.\n\nThe net, made of cord or metal cable covered by a band and held taut by a strap at the center, stands 3 feet (0.914 meters) high at the center and 3 feet 6 inches (1.07 meters) high at the posts, which for doubles are positioned 3 feet (0.914 meters) outside the court boundaries.\n\nTennis courts are constructed on various surfaces, each influencing ball speed and bounce: grass provides a fast pace with low, unpredictable bounce, as seen at Wimbledon; clay offers a slow pace with high bounce, exemplified by the red clay at the French Open; hard courts deliver medium speed and consistent medium-to-high bounce, used at the US Open and Australian Open; and carpet, an indoor synthetic textile surface, was medium-fast but has been largely discontinued from professional play since the early 2000s. The International Tennis Federation (ITF) classifies surfaces into five pace categories from slow (1) to fast (5) based on performance testing, with grass typically rated 4-5, clay at 1-2, and hard courts at 3-4. These surface differences result in varied ball bounce heights and trajectories, affecting player strategies.\n\n### Play of a point\n\nA point in tennis begins with the service, where the server stands behind the baseline and between the imaginary extensions of the center mark and the sideline of the court they are serving from. The server must release the ball by hand—without bouncing, catching, or throwing it—and strike it with the racket before it touches the ground, initiating the point. Servers alternate the side from which they serve for each point, starting from the right side of the court for the first point of a game.\n\nOnce served, the ball enters play and the rally commences, during which each player must allow the ball to bounce once on their side of the net before striking it back over the net and into the opponent's court. The ball remains in play until the point is decided, provided it does not result in a fault or let; a ball touching any line is considered in bounds. For the service specifically, the ball must land in the diagonally opposite service box; failure to do so constitutes a fault, and if the server commits two consecutive faults—known as a double fault—they lose the point.\n\nThe point ends and the ball is out of play if it hits a permanent fixture (such as the net posts, unless during a let serve), touches a player or their clothing before bouncing, or lands outside the correct court boundaries. A let serve occurs if the served ball touches the net, strap, or band but otherwise lands in the service box, or if the receiver is not ready; in such cases, the serve is replayed without affecting any prior fault.\n\nIn singles, play involves only the server and receiver on a court 27 feet wide, with each responsible for returning the ball to the opponent's side. Doubles play uses a wider court of 36 feet, where partners position themselves strategically—typically one near the net and one at the baseline—to cover the court, and either partner may strike the ball after the initial return of serve, following a predetermined serving and receiving order. No-ad scoring, where a deciding point is played immediately upon deuce without an advantage, is optional in doubles and shortens games by eliminating extended deuce play.\n\n### Scoring\n\nTennis scoring progresses through points, games, sets, and matches, with a unique numerical system that has evolved to ensure fairness and excitement. A point is the basic unit, awarded to the player who wins a rally according to the rules. The scoring for points within a game uses the terms love for zero, followed by 15, 30, and 40. The first player to reach 40 and win the next point claims the game, unless the score ties at 40-40, known as deuce. From deuce, a player must win the next point to gain advantage; if they win the following point, they secure the game, but if the opponent wins it, the score returns to deuce, requiring a two-point margin to win.\n\nA set consists of games, typically won by the first player to secure six games while leading by at least two. If the score reaches six games all, a tiebreak is played to determine the set winner. The tiebreak is scored using ordinary point counts (1, 2, 3, etc.), with the first to seven points prevailing by a margin of two; serving alternates every two points, starting with one serve from the previous game's receiver. Matches are generally best of three sets for women and doubles, or best of five for men in major events, with the overall winner being the first to win the majority of sets.\n\nThe final set of a match may follow advantage set rules, where play continues until one player leads by two games without a tiebreak, potentially extending indefinitely, or it may use a tiebreak at six games all. Since 2022, all four Grand Slam tournaments—Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, and US Open—have uniformly adopted a 10-point tiebreak at six games all in the final set, with the winner being the first to 10 points by a two-point margin; this standardization, effective through 2025, aims to balance match length and decisiveness across majors.\n\nAlternative scoring formats exist for specific contexts. No-ad scoring, used in some recreational and fast-paced events, simplifies deuce by awarding the game to the winner of a single deciding point, with the receiver choosing the service side. In doubles matches, particularly in non-professional play or certain tournaments, a super tiebreak—first to 10 points by two—may replace the third set when the match is tied at one set all, streamlining competition.\n\n### Match procedures\n\nIn professional tennis matches, players change ends of the court after the first game and every subsequent odd-numbered game to ensure fairness in adapting to varying conditions across the court surface. During these changeovers, a maximum of 90 seconds is permitted for players to rest, towel off, and receive hydration, starting from the completion of the previous game. At the conclusion of each set—except the final set in deciding-set formats—a 120-second set break is allowed, providing additional recovery time before the next set begins. Pre-match warm-ups are limited to five minutes, during which players hit a limited number of balls to prepare without gaining an unfair advantage, and no further warm-up is permitted unless the match is suspended for over 15 minutes.\n\nTo maintain consistent playing conditions, new balls are introduced at specified intervals in professional matches. The first change occurs after seven games, accounting for the pre-match warm-up usage, followed by changes every nine games thereafter, as determined by tournament organizers in alignment with International Tennis Federation (ITF) guidelines. This procedure, standard across ATP, WTA, and Grand Slam events, prevents degradation of ball bounce and speed due to wear from high-impact play.\n\nCoaching during matches has evolved to balance player support with competitive integrity. Since January 2025, off-court coaching is permitted across all ITF-sanctioned professional events, including Grand Slams, ATP, and WTA tours, allowing coaches seated in designated areas to provide verbal advice or hand signals between points, during changeovers, and at set breaks—but not during active play. Coaches must remain discreet and brief to avoid disrupting the match flow, with violations subject to penalties under the event's code of conduct. Prior to this, limited on-court coaching trials began in 2022 on the ATP and WTA circuits, typically one per set as a one-minute timeout, while Grand Slams maintained stricter prohibitions except for emergencies like medical consultations.\n\nPace-of-play enforcement includes a 25-second shot clock between points, introduced at the 2018 US Open and now standard in professional tournaments to expedite matches. The clock activates automatically after the previous point ends, and failure to serve or receive within the limit results in a warning on the first offense, followed by point penalties for subsequent violations, as overseen by the chair umpire. This rule applies uniformly to all points, integrating with the overall scoring structure where delays can directly impact game outcomes.\n\n## Techniques\n\n### Stance\n\nIn tennis, stance refers to the positioning of the feet and distribution of body weight during the preparation and execution of shots, which significantly influences balance, power generation, and recovery speed. Proper stance allows players to maintain stability while adapting to the ball's trajectory and court position. The four primary stances—open, closed, semi-open, and neutral—each offer distinct biomechanical advantages, with selection depending on the player's style, the shot's demands, and the pace of play.\n\nThe open stance features feet positioned parallel to the baseline, typically shoulder-width apart or wider, with both feet facing forward and weight primarily on the outside edges of the feet for enhanced lateral stability. This setup evenly distributes weight with a slight forward lean, facilitating quick directional changes and efficient recovery to the court's center. It is particularly suited to modern baseline play, where players generate topspin and handle wide or high-bouncing balls defensively, as the parallel alignment minimizes rotational torque while maximizing ground force absorption.\n\nIn contrast, the closed stance involves the front foot pointed toward the net and the back foot positioned perpendicular to the baseline, slightly behind and aligned with the intended shot direction, creating an angular setup that promotes forward momentum transfer. Weight initially rests more on the back foot before shifting forward during the stroke, providing greater linear drive and rotational power. This traditional stance excels in volleys and serves, where aggressive, net-approaching play requires maximum stability and force projection.\n\nThe semi-open stance serves as a hybrid, with the front foot angled slightly toward the net while the back foot remains more open, positioning the feet on a diagonal relative to the baseline. Weight distribution favors the front foot to support torso rotation, blending the power of closed positioning with the mobility of open setups. It balances force generation and quick recovery, making it ideal for topspin groundstrokes in dynamic rallies.\n\nThe neutral stance, also known as squared, places feet perpendicular to the baseline at shoulder-width apart, with even weight distribution across both feet for dynamic balance. This versatile position allows fluid weight shifts and is commonly used in the ready position or for shorter, lower balls that demand control over power.\n\n### Grip\n\nIn tennis, the grip refers to the specific manner in which a player positions their hand on the racket handle, fundamentally influencing the racket face angle at ball contact, the spin generated, and the balance between power and control in shot production. Grips are typically described using the eight bevels of the octagonal handle, with right-handed players aligning the base knuckle of the index finger and heel of the palm to specific bevels to achieve desired effects. The choice of grip adapts to playing style, court surface, and opponent tendencies, allowing players to optimize trajectories and bounces.\n\nThe Eastern forehand grip places the palm directly behind the handle, with the index knuckle on bevel 3, promoting a neutral racket face orientation that supports balanced, flat shots with solid power and directional control. This grip aligns the hand in the same plane as the racket face, directing the ball based on the swing path while accommodating various spins and stances, and positions the ideal hitting zone slightly farther forward from the body.\n\nThe Western forehand grip rotates the hand so the knuckles are under the handle, with the index knuckle on bevel 5, closing the racket face to maximize topspin through enhanced wrist action and resulting in high-bouncing shots that skid on clay or slower surfaces. This configuration shifts the hitting zone higher and closer to the body, favoring defensive recovery or aggressive baseline exchanges but requiring greater upper-body rotation for power.\n\nThe Continental grip resembles shaking hands with the racket, positioning the index knuckle on bevel 2 for a neutral hold that slightly opens the racket face on forehands while enabling seamless transitions across strokes without regripping. Primarily used for serves, volleys, overheads, and slices, it enhances wrist mobility and precision at the net but limits topspin on groundstrokes, making it less common for baseline forehands in professional play.\n\nOverall, grip variations directly modify racket angle, spin potential, and power dynamics; for instance, the semi-Western grip (index knuckle on bevel 4) blends Eastern balance with Western topspin for versatile, aggressive baseline play, often paired with open stances to maintain forward momentum.\n\n### Shots\n\nIn tennis, shots encompass the fundamental strokes used to propel the ball over the net, each designed to impart specific trajectories, spins, and speeds to control the point. These strokes are executed with variations in grip, stance, and swing path to suit tactical needs, building on basic hand positions like the continental or eastern grips for versatility across shots. The primary shots include the serve to start play, groundstrokes for baseline exchanges, and net approaches like volleys and overheads for aggressive finishing.\n\nThe serve begins each point and involves an overhead motion where the player tosses the ball into the air and strikes it with a fluid, explosive arm action above the head, typically from behind the baseline. According to International Tennis Federation (ITF) rules, the server must stand with both feet behind the baseline and within the imaginary extensions of the center mark and sideline before initiating the toss and swing, with the ball released by hand and struck before touching the ground. Violations of foot positioning, known as foot faults, occur if the server walks or runs during the motion, or if either foot touches the baseline, the court outside the sideline extensions, or the imaginary extension of the center mark after the feet are at rest but before striking the ball; such faults result in a loss of the point on the first serve or a second serve attempt.\n\nServes vary by spin and purpose: the flat serve employs a pronated wrist snap at contact for minimal spin and maximum velocity, with professional players achieving speeds exceeding 150 mph, as exemplified by John Isner's ATP Tour record of 157.2 mph in 2016. In contrast, the slice serve uses brush-like contact across the ball's side to generate sidespin, causing it to curve and skid low after the bounce, while the kick serve applies heavy topspin via a low-to-high swing path, producing a high, arcing bounce that is significantly higher than that of a flat serve.\n\nGroundstrokes, hit after the ball bounces, form the core of baseline play and include the forehand and backhand. The forehand groundstroke typically uses a semi-western grip, with the racquet prepared in a compact backswing and accelerated through a low-to-high swing path to impart topspin, allowing the ball to dip sharply over the net and bounce with forward momentum. The backhand, whether one-handed or two-handed, follows a similar unit turn of shoulders and hips, but the one-handed version often employs an eastern grip for a linear drive, while the two-handed adds stability with the non-dominant hand. Defensive variants include the slice forehand or backhand, executed with a continental grip and a high-to-low, chopping swing to produce backspin, resulting in a low, skidding trajectory that stays deep and forces opponents to lift the ball.\n\nOther essential shots include the volley, lob, drop shot, and smash, each suited to net play or defensive scenarios. The volley is struck before the bounce near the net using a short, punching motion with a continental grip and minimal backswing, emphasizing forward drive and racquet face control to block or redirect the ball aggressively. The lob provides a defensive high-arcing shot with topspin, hit softly upward to clear an approaching opponent and land deep in their court, often from a baseline position under pressure. The drop shot employs a delicate underspin touch with an open racquet face and abbreviated swing to make the ball land just over the net, enticing the opponent forward while minimizing pace. The smash, akin to an overhead serve, targets high-bouncing balls at the net with a full overhead swing for power, using the same pronated action as the flat serve to finish points decisively.\n\nTactically, shots enable strategies like baseline rallying, where players exchange topspin groundstrokes to wear down opponents through depth and angles, or net rushing, involving a serve or approach shot followed by volleys and smashes to shorten points and exploit weak returns. Professional matches often blend these, with baseline dominance favoring endurance and consistency, while net play rewards precision and aggression.\n\n## Professional tennis\n\n### Grand Slam tournaments\n\nThe Grand Slam tournaments represent the pinnacle of professional tennis, comprising four major annual events that award the highest points in the ATP and WTA rankings systems and draw the largest audiences. Overseen by the International Tennis Federation (ITF), these tournaments—the Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, and US Open—feature the world's top players competing for prestigious titles, substantial prize money, and career-defining achievements. Winning all four distinctively over a career is known as the Career Grand Slam, a rare feat accomplished by select legends such as Roger Federer, who completed his in 2009 by winning the French Open, and Serena Williams, who achieved hers in 2003 at the Australian Open.\n\nThe Australian Open takes place in January at Melbourne Park in Melbourne, Australia, on hard courts, marking the start of the tennis calendar; it originated in 1905 as the Australasian Championships and was officially recognized as a Grand Slam event in 1924. The French Open, held from late May to early June at Stade Roland-Garros in Paris, France, on red clay courts, began in 1891 and opened to international players in 1925, emphasizing endurance due to the slower surface. Wimbledon, the oldest Grand Slam, occurs in late June to early July at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club in London, United Kingdom, on grass courts; it was first staged in 1877 and maintains traditions like the all-white dress code for players, enforced strictly since the late 19th century to preserve the event's aesthetic. The US Open runs from August to early September at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in New York City, United States, on hard courts, tracing its roots to 1881 as the U.S. National Championships before adopting its current name in 1968.\n\nIn terms of format, men's singles and doubles matches in the main draws are played as best-of-five sets, while women's events use best-of-three sets, a structure that has been standard since the Open Era began in 1968 to highlight differences in physical demands. All four tournaments have provided equal total prize money for men and women since 2007, when Wimbledon and the French Open joined the Australian Open and US Open in this commitment, promoting gender equity in the sport. Unique features enhance each event's identity: Wimbledon enforces its all-white attire rule, prohibiting off-white or colored elements from the moment players enter the court, while the French Open introduced evening night sessions under floodlights in 2021 to extend play and boost spectator engagement on Philippe-Chatrier Court. These elements, combined with retractable roofs on major show courts across the Slams for weather protection, underscore their status as global spectacles integrated into the broader ATP and WTA tours.\n\n### ATP Tour\n\nThe Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), founded in September 1972 by a group of players including Cliff Drysdale, Jack Kramer, and Arthur Ashe, serves as the principal governing body for men's professional tennis, managing tournaments, rankings, and player relations to promote and regulate the sport. The ATP's structure emphasizes a global circuit that balances competition, player welfare, and commercial interests, with decisions guided by a board comprising player representatives and tournament directors.\n\nThe ATP Rankings, established in 1973 as an objective merit-based system, determine player standings through points accumulated from tournament performances over a 52-week period, with points decaying annually to reflect current form. A Grand Slam victory awards 2000 points, the highest possible from a single event, underscoring the majors' prestige within the broader tour. Points from all ATP-sanctioned events contribute to these rankings, influencing tournament entry, seeding, and qualification for year-end championships.\n\nThe ATP Tour comprises tiered tournament categories designed to provide progressive competition levels. The pinnacle non-Grand Slam events are the nine ATP Masters 1000 tournaments, eight of which are mandatory for top-30 ranked players, featuring large draws and high prize money on diverse surfaces like clay, hard courts, and grass. The ATP 500 series includes 16 events, offering 32- or 48-player singles draws for established professionals seeking consistent ranking gains. Complementing these are approximately 29 ATP 250 tournaments, which host 28-player fields and serve as accessible venues for a wider pool of competitors, totaling around 56 ATP events annually across continents. The season concludes with the Nitto ATP Finals in Turin, a prestigious round-robin event for the top eight singles players based on year-end rankings, where participants compete for significant bonuses and the title of world No. 1.\n\nFor developing players, the ATP Challenger Tour acts as an essential developmental circuit, with over 200 events in 2025 offering prize money from $50,000 to $225,000 and ranking points that directly feed into the main tour pathway. Below this level, the ITF Men's World Tennis Tour—encompassing former Futures events—provides entry-level professional competition at $15,000 to $100,000 levels, where successes earn limited ATP ranking points to help emerging talents climb the ladder.\n\nIn 2025, the ATP Tour calendar spans 60 tournaments across 29 countries, but has drawn criticism for schedule compression, exacerbated by seven Masters 1000 events extending to 12 days and the addition of three new 500-level stops, prompting player advocacy for better rest periods amid injury risks; however, the core structure remains intact without sweeping reforms.\n\n### WTA Tour\n\nThe Women's Tennis Association (WTA), the governing body for women's professional tennis, was established in 1970 through the efforts of the \"Original 9\" players who signed symbolic $1 contracts to launch the Virginia Slims Circuit, challenging gender disparities in prize money and opportunities. This initiative formalized the structure for women's tours, evolving into the modern WTA Tour that sanctions events worldwide and maintains a points-based ranking system to determine player standings. The rankings, calculated weekly from a player's best 18 tournament results over 52 weeks, award 2000 points to the winner of a Grand Slam tournament, integrating these major events seamlessly into the WTA framework to reflect overall performance.\n\nThe WTA Tour is organized into tiered categories based on event prestige, prize money, and points allocation, with the highest level comprising WTA 1000 tournaments—nine events including the season-ending WTA Finals, which gather the top eight singles players and doubles teams in a round-robin format followed by knockouts. These are followed by the WTA 500 series, featuring 10 tournaments that offer substantial competition and points, and the WTA 250 series, encompassing 25 events that provide broader access for players across various surfaces and locations. Complementing these, the WTA 125 series serves as a transitional circuit, enabling emerging players to gain professional experience and accumulate rankings points between lower-level ITF events and the main tour. Prior to the 2021 rebranding, these categories were known as Premier Mandatory, Premier 5, Premier, and International events, a restructuring aligned with the ATP Tour's nomenclature to enhance consistency and visibility.\n\nIn 2025, the WTA continued its push toward prize money parity with the men's tour, building on a 2023 strategy aiming for equal purses at combined events by 2033, exemplified by the WTA Finals offering a record $15.5 million total—$12.4 million for singles—marking an increase from prior years. Additionally, the International Tennis Federation's rule change effective January 2025 permitted off-court coaching during matches across all levels, including WTA events, allowing players greater strategic support while maintaining on-court focus.\n\n## Players and careers\n\n### Professional players\n\nProfessional tennis players enter the sport's elite level through a structured transition from junior competitions, governed by International Tennis Federation (ITF) regulations designed to safeguard young athletes' development. Players are ineligible to compete in professional World Tennis Tour events until they turn 14, and those under 18 face limits on the number of professional tournaments they can enter annually, such as a maximum of 10 events per year for 14- and 15-year-olds. This age eligibility rule, outlined in the ITF's player identification number (IPIN) guidelines, aims to prevent burnout and prioritize education alongside early career progression. Aspiring professionals typically build experience in ITF junior circuits before gaining access to pro-level events via strong performances in lower-tier ITF World Tennis Tour tournaments or through wild card invitations to ATP or WTA events, which allow promising juniors to compete against established players.\n\nCareers in professional tennis often specialize in either singles or doubles, reflecting the distinct skills required for each discipline, with success in both being uncommon due to the contrasting physical endurance needed for long singles matches versus the quick reflexes and net play essential in doubles. Many players dedicate their efforts to doubles, where partnerships can lead to prolonged success; for instance, the Bryan brothers exemplified doubles specialists by focusing exclusively on the format throughout their careers, amassing numerous titles without pursuing significant singles play. This specialization allows players to optimize training for the format's unique demands, such as volleying and poaching, while singles players prioritize baseline rallies and stamina.\n\nTennis returned to the Olympic Games as a full medal sport in 1988 after a 64-year absence, offering professional players a quadrennial opportunity to compete for national representation in singles, doubles, and, since 2012, mixed doubles events. Although Olympic achievements do not award direct ranking points in the ATP or WTA systems, medals enhance a player's global prestige and can indirectly support career opportunities through increased sponsorships and media exposure. The event's inclusion underscores the sport's international appeal, drawing top professionals despite its infrequency and the absence of standard tour points.\n\nThe professional tennis lifestyle is characterized by intense demands, including year-round travel to up to 20 countries across an 11-month season from January to November, leaving limited time for rest and home life. Players must adapt to diverse surfaces, time zones, and climates while maintaining rigorous training regimens that include strength conditioning, tactical drills, and recovery protocols to sustain performance amid 50-70 matches per year. This nomadic schedule, combined with the mental toll of high-stakes competition, often requires support teams of coaches, physiotherapists, and nutritionists to manage fatigue and injuries. Top professionals can earn substantial prize money as a result, with career totals often exceeding tens of millions of dollars for consistent performers on the ATP and WTA Tours.\n\n### Notable achievements\n\nIn men's singles, Novak Djokovic holds the all-time record with 24 Grand Slam titles as of November 2025, surpassing Rafael Nadal's 22 and Roger Federer's 20. In women's singles, Margaret Court leads with 24 titles, followed by Serena Williams with 23 and Steffi Graf with 22. As of November 2025, Jannik Sinner holds the year-end ATP No. 1 ranking, while Iga Świątek leads the WTA with over 100 weeks at No. 1.\n\nDeterminations of the greatest players often rely on criteria such as total Grand Slam titles, weeks spent at world No. 1, and versatility across surfaces. In the men's game, the \"Big Three\" era—dominated by Federer, Nadal, and Djokovic—has defined modern excellence, with Djokovic accumulating a record 428 weeks at No. 1. For women, Serena Williams' 23 majors and 319 weeks at No. 1 underscore her dominance, while the rivalry between Chris Evert (18 majors) and Martina Navratilova (18 majors) revolutionized the sport in the 1970s and 1980s, with Navratilova holding 332 weeks at No. 1 and Graf the overall record of 377.\n\nNotable records include the longest professional match, contested by John Isner and Nicolas Mahut at Wimbledon in 2010, which lasted 11 hours and 5 minutes over three days and ended 6–4, 3–6, 6–7(7–9), 7–6(7–3), 70–68. The fastest recorded serve in ATP history is John Isner's 253 km/h (157.2 mph) delivery during the 2016 Davis Cup.\n\nA Career Golden Slam—winning all four majors plus Olympic singles gold—has been achieved by five players: Andre Agassi, Rafael Nadal, and Novak Djokovic in men's singles; Steffi Graf and Serena Williams in women's singles.\n\n### Prize money and rankings\n\nProfessional tennis features substantial prize money distributed across tournaments, with the four Grand Slam events offering a combined total exceeding $250 million in 2024. Each major tournament allocates between $60 million and $75 million, exemplified by the US Open's record $75 million purse, where singles champions received $3.6 million. Since 2007, all Grand Slams have provided equal prize money for men's and women's singles champions, a milestone achieved after the Australian Open in 2001, followed by the French Open and Wimbledon in 2007. However, disparities persist on the regular tours, where ATP events generally offer higher purses than WTA counterparts—for instance, the 2024 ATP Finals winner earned $4.9 million compared to $4.8 million at the WTA Finals.\n\nThe overall prize money ecosystem in professional tennis totals approximately $800 million annually across ATP and WTA tours, excluding exhibitions, with top earners like Jannik Sinner collecting over $14 million in 2024 alone. Earnings are heavily skewed, as players in the top 100 typically secure millions through tournament wins, while those ranked 100-200 often earn $50,000 to $150,000 yearly before expenses like travel and coaching, leading many to struggle financially. Sponsorships and endorsements significantly supplement income for elite players, often dwarfing on-court earnings—for example, Carlos Alcaraz's total 2025 compensation reached $48.3 million, with $13.3 million from prize money.\n\nRankings in professional tennis are governed by separate ATP and WTA computer-based systems that use a 52-week rolling period to accumulate points from tournament performances, with the highest 18 results counting for singles. These rankings determine tournament entries, seedings, and year-end championships qualification. Doubles rankings operate independently, based on the best 12 results over the same period, allowing players to specialize or compete in both disciplines without overlap. To accommodate injuries, players absent for at least 90 days can apply for a protected ranking, which preserves their pre-injury standing for up to nine events upon return, preventing a complete rankings drop.\n\nIn 2025, prize money totals have risen notably due to investments from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, including a record $15.5 million at the WTA Finals in Riyadh and a new ATP Masters 1000 event starting in 2028, alongside exhibitions like the Six Kings Slam offering $6 million to the winner. These developments have boosted overall purses by tens of millions, enhancing financial incentives amid ongoing efforts to address tour-level gender pay gaps.\n\n## Officials and governance\n\n### Officials\n\nTennis matches are officiated by a team of personnel responsible for enforcing the rules, ensuring fair play, and maintaining the integrity of the competition. These officials include on-court umpires and supervisory roles, with increasing integration of technology to enhance accuracy. The International Tennis Federation (ITF) outlines the duties of these officials in its official guidelines.\n\nThe chair umpire is the primary on-court official, positioned in an elevated chair overlooking the match. This official enforces the Rules of Tennis, the applicable Tournament Rules and Regulations, and the Code of Conduct; determines questions of fact such as whether a ball is in or out; announces the score after each point; and manages all aspects of the match, including timing procedures like the 25-second limit between points. The chair umpire also oversees ball persons, controls crowd behavior if necessary, and handles player requests such as medical timeouts or equipment changes. In cases of clear errors, the chair umpire can overrule line umpires promptly, stating \"Correction, the ball was good\" or similar. Additionally, on clay courts, the chair umpire may inspect ball marks to verify calls.\n\nLine umpires traditionally number between six and nine per court, each assigned to specific lines such as baselines, sidelines, and service lines. Their primary duty is to call whether balls landing on their assigned lines are in or out, using verbal announcements and flag signals; they also report foot faults to the chair umpire and signal if a call is unsighted. Line umpires must refrain from opining on other lines and correct their own erroneous calls immediately. However, line umpires have been phased out in many professional events since the late 2010s in favor of electronic systems, with full adoption across the ATP Tour by 2025 to optimize consistency and reduce human error. For instance, the U.S. Open eliminated line judges in 2020, relying entirely on automated calling except in case of system failure.\n\nThe chief umpire and referee provide overarching supervision for the tournament. The chief umpire recruits, trains, and schedules on-court officials; evaluates their performance; and ensures sufficient competent personnel are available, while assisting the referee in operations. The referee, as the final on-site authority, interprets rules, approves court conditions (such as chair height between 6 and 8 feet), manages the draw and scheduling, and handles code violations or disputes escalating beyond the chair umpire. These roles ensure the competition adheres to ITF standards and fair play protocols.\n\nElectronic line calling, primarily through the Hawk-Eye system, has revolutionized officiating by providing automated in/out decisions with high precision. Hawk-Eye uses multiple high-speed cameras to track the ball's trajectory, achieving an accuracy of 99.9% in professional tennis. In review electronic line calling (where line umpires are present), players receive three unsuccessful challenges per set, plus one additional in a tie-break, allowing the chair umpire to consult the system for verification. In live electronic line calling (ELC), the system makes calls automatically without line umpires, announcing decisions directly; this format, implemented in events like the Australian Open since 2021, resets challenges per set and stands as final unless a malfunction occurs. The ITF permits ELC in various tournament categories, with review officials monitoring system integrity and notifying the chair umpire of any issues.\n\n### Governing bodies\n\nThe International Tennis Federation (ITF), founded on 1 March 1913 as the world governing body for tennis, oversees the sport's rules, international competitions, and development across more than 210 member nations. The ITF establishes and maintains the official Rules of Tennis, which govern all levels of play, including specifications for equipment, court dimensions, and match procedures, ensuring uniformity worldwide. It organizes major team events such as the Davis Cup, launched in 1900 and administered by the ITF since 1923, featuring men's national teams in a knockout format, and the Billie Jean King Cup, formerly the Fed Cup since 1963, which serves as the premier women's international team competition.\n\nThe Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), established in 1972 as a players' association to represent male professionals, evolved into the governing body for men's tennis tours by 1990, managing a circuit of over 60 tournaments annually that determine rankings and prize distribution. Similarly, the Women's Tennis Association (WTA), formed in 1973 under the leadership of Billie Jean King to promote gender equity, governs the WTA Tour, comprising around 50 events for women and enforcing player welfare standards alongside competitive scheduling. Both organizations collaborate with the ITF on unified rules for professional play while focusing on tour operations, contrasting with the ITF's broader regulatory scope.\n\nThe International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA), established in 2020, oversees anti-doping and anti-corruption programs for the sport.\n\nNational federations play a crucial role in tennis governance by implementing international standards locally and facilitating participation in global events, including Olympic qualification. The United States Tennis Association (USTA), founded in 1881, administers tennis in the U.S., hosting events like the US Open and nominating athletes for Olympics based on ITF criteria such as ATP/WTA rankings. In the United Kingdom, the Lawn Tennis Association (LTA), established in 1888, oversees domestic development and supports British players' Olympic entries through national selection aligned with ITF guidelines. The Fédération Française de Tennis (FFT), created in 1891, manages French tennis, including Roland Garros, and handles Olympic nominations via ITF-approved processes that prioritize top-ranked players per nation. These bodies ensure compliance with ITF protocols for events like the Olympics, where each country can enter up to four singles players per gender based on world rankings as of June in the Olympic year.\n\nTennis anti-doping efforts are administered by the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) since 2022, in coordination with the ITF and in full compliance with the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) Code, which mandates testing, education, and sanctions for violations to maintain sport integrity. The ITIA's program includes out-of-competition testing and therapeutic use exemptions, with WADA oversight ensuring global standards; violations can result in suspensions, as seen in cases like Australian player Max Purcell's provisional suspension in December 2024 for admitting use of a prohibited method (intravenous infusion), leading to an 18-month ban accepted in April 2025. High-profile instances highlight the rigorous enforcement and appeal processes.\n\n## Participation and development\n\n### Junior tennis\n\nJunior tennis encompasses organized competitive play for players under 18 years of age, fostering skill development and preparing participants for potential professional careers. Governing bodies such as the United States Tennis Association (USTA) and the International Tennis Federation (ITF) structure junior programs into distinct age groups to accommodate physical and technical growth. In the USTA system, divisions include 8 and under (8U), 10 and under (10U), 12 and under (12U), 14 and under (14U), 16 and under (16U), and 18 and under (18U), with eligibility determined by the player's age as of the tournament's start date. The ITF World Tennis Tour Juniors primarily targets players aged 13 to 18, with team competitions focusing on 14U and 16U categories to build international experience. These circuits, such as the USTA Junior Circuit, often employ non-elimination round-robin formats to maximize match play and reduce pressure for younger athletes.\n\nProminent international tournaments, like the Junior Orange Bowl International Tennis Championships, highlight top talent in the 12U and 14U divisions, serving as key events on the ITF calendar with Grade A status. Held annually in December at the Jimmy Evert Tennis Center in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, the Orange Bowl attracts elite players worldwide and has a legacy of identifying future stars since its inception in 1947. To promote accessibility and fun, rules are adapted for younger age groups, particularly in 10U tennis. This format uses smaller courts—such as 36-foot lengths for red-ball play—lower nets, lighter low-compression balls (red, orange, or green stage balls), and simplified scoring like no-ad sets to four games with a seven-point tiebreak at 4-all, enabling children aged 8-10 to rally more effectively without excessive physical strain.\n\nThe pathway from junior to professional tennis revolves around high-level competition and rankings. Junior Grand Slam events at the Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, and US Open offer crucial exposure, with winners earning ITF junior ranking points that influence seeding and invitations to pro circuits. The ITF maintains combined boys' and girls' world junior rankings based on tournament results, providing a merit-based progression to the professional level, though success here does not guarantee pro achievement due to the demands of adult competition. In 2025, the ITF introduced off-court coaching allowances across all events, including juniors, permitting verbal advice and signals from coaches during changeovers and set breaks to enhance player support without disrupting match flow—this change, trialed in Europe, applies to Tennis Europe Junior Tour events except where on-court umpiring is required.\n\nDevelopment in junior tennis emphasizes structured coaching, financial support, and educational integration. Programs like the USTA NorCal Player Development pathway offer progressive training from entry-level to elite stages, incorporating technical drills, mental conditioning, and fitness tailored to age groups. Scholarships play a vital role, particularly through college tennis in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), where Division I men's teams can award up to 4.5 full scholarships and women's up to 8, often based on Universal Tennis Rating (UTR) benchmarks for recruitment. Recent NCAA updates for 2025 include limiting players to one bathroom break per match, which can combine with a medical timeout if unused, alongside penalties for abusive medical timeout requests to curb gamesmanship and ensure fair play. These elements collectively bridge junior competition to professional or collegiate pursuits.\n\n### Wheelchair tennis\n\nWheelchair tennis is an adaptive form of the sport designed for players with permanent lower-limb impairments, allowing them to compete using specially designed wheelchairs that enable quick directional changes and stability. The rules closely mirror those of able-bodied tennis, including the same court dimensions, net height of 0.914 meters (3 feet), racket specifications, and scoring system, with the key modification being the two-bounce rule: the ball may bounce up to twice before being returned, provided the first bounce lands within the boundaries.\n\nPlayers are classified into two main divisions to ensure fair competition: the Open division for those with impairments affecting one or both lower limbs but with full function in their arms and hands, and the Quad division for athletes with additional impairments in their upper limbs, trunk, or shortening of the arm that impacts playing ability. Classification is managed by the International Tennis Federation (ITF) through medical assessments to verify eligibility and assign sport classes, promoting equitable grouping in tournaments.\n\nThe sport originated in 1976 when American Brad Parks, paralyzed after a skiing accident, began playing tennis from a wheelchair in California, sparking its development as a recreational and competitive activity. It gained momentum in the 1980s with the establishment of national programs, notably in France, and received formal recognition from the ITF, which launched the ITF Wheelchair Tennis Tour in 1992 with 11 international events. Wheelchair tennis debuted as a demonstration sport at the 1988 Seoul Paralympics before becoming a full medal event at the 1992 Barcelona Games, where it has since featured men's and women's singles and doubles across Open and Quad categories.\n\nMajor tournaments include wheelchair events at all four Grand Slams—Australian Open, Roland Garros, Wimbledon, and US Open—integrated since 2007, alongside the ITF Super Series and the year-end Wheelchair Tennis Masters. These events offer significant prize money and ranking points on the UNIQLO Wheelchair Tennis Tour, which now comprises over 160 international tournaments annually. Prominent players include Japan's Shingo Kunieda, who retired in 2023 as the all-time leader with 28 Grand Slam singles titles, eight Paralympic medals (including four golds), and seven ITF World Championships, exemplifying the sport's elite level.\n\nWheelchair tennis has experienced rapid global expansion, recognized as one of the fastest-growing Paralympic sports, with participation supported by ITF development programs that fund training, equipment, and inclusive events blending able-bodied and wheelchair play. While exact worldwide figures vary, the sport engages thousands of athletes across more than 60 countries, fostering community through grassroots initiatives and professional pathways.\n\n### Injuries\n\nTennis players, particularly professionals, are prone to overuse injuries due to the sport's demands for repetitive high-velocity serves, rapid lateral movements, and explosive changes in direction. Common injuries include lateral epicondylitis, known as tennis elbow, which arises from repetitive strain on the wrist extensor tendons at the lateral epicondyle of the humerus. Shoulder rotator cuff tears frequently occur from the overhead serving motion, leading to impingement and tendon damage in the rotator cuff muscles. Ankle sprains, often lateral, result from sudden pivots and uneven foot landings during play. Lower back stress injuries, such as lumbar strains, stem from the hyperextension and rotational forces generated in serves and groundstrokes. These injuries account for significant portions of musculoskeletal issues in tennis; for instance, shoulder and lower back problems are among the top locations, with thigh, shoulder, and knee injuries comprising over 30% of cases in tournament settings.\n\nThe causes of these injuries are tied to the biomechanical stresses of tennis, including high-impact serves that overload the shoulder and elbow, and quick lateral movements that strain ankles and the lower back. Professional players experience an incidence of approximately 0.46 injuries per male player and 0.42 per female player annually, reflecting the cumulative toll of intense training and competition. Overuse predominates, with muscle-tendon injuries being the most frequent type, exacerbated by poor technique, inadequate recovery, or mismatched equipment.\n\nPrevention strategies emphasize building resilience through targeted strength training, such as resistance exercises for the forearm, shoulder stabilizers, and core muscles, which enhance tendon quality and reduce strain risk. Proper technique, including optimized serving mechanics and grip adjustments, minimizes eccentric loading on vulnerable areas. Equipment choices, like rackets with vibration-dampening features and appropriate string tension, further mitigate repetitive impact on the elbow and shoulder.\n\nTreatment options range from conservative measures like rest, ice, and physical therapy to advanced interventions such as platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections, which promote healing in chronic tendinopathies like tennis elbow by delivering concentrated growth factors to damaged tissues. For severe cases, such as full rotator cuff tears or persistent ankle instability, arthroscopic surgery may be required to repair ligaments or tendons, often followed by rehabilitation to restore function. PRP has shown superior pain relief and grip strength outcomes compared to surgery in some tennis elbow studies, with benefits persisting up to a year.\n\nInjuries profoundly affect professional careers, prompting mechanisms like protected rankings, which allow players to reserve points from pre-injury performances during recovery periods of up to nine months, safeguarding their tournament entry and earnings potential. Tours provide insurance support, including ATP's financial safety net for top-250 players, offering compensation for lost prize money due to verified injuries and enabling focus on rehabilitation without immediate financial ruin.\n\n## Cultural impact\n\n### Popular culture\n\nTennis has been a recurring theme in cinema, often exploring themes of ambition, gender dynamics, and personal triumph. Woody Allen's 2005 psychological thriller *Match Point* centers on a former professional tennis player navigating class ascent and moral dilemmas through his relationships, using the sport as a metaphor for life's precarious chances. The 2017 film *Battle of the Sexes*, directed by Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, dramatizes the iconic 1973 exhibition match between Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs, highlighting the fight for gender equality in sports and society. Similarly, *King Richard* (2021), directed by Reinaldo Marcus Green, portrays the story of Richard Williams and his daughters Venus and Serena, emphasizing family determination and the challenges faced by Black athletes in tennis. In 2025, films like *Julie Keeps Quiet*, a drama set at an elite tennis academy exploring themes of silence and pressure, and *My Tennis Maestro*, which follows a teen prodigy and his ex-champion coach on a transformative journey, further highlighted the sport's emotional and relational narratives..com/title/tt5179884/)\n\nIn television, tennis appears in comedic episodes that satirize the sport's intensity and social aspects. The sitcom *Friends* features tennis in several scenes, such as Monica Geller's competitive matches and Chandler Bing's unexpected proficiency, drawing on the real-life junior tennis background of actor Matthew Perry to add authenticity. *The Simpsons* dedicates an entire episode, \"Tennis the Menace\" (Season 12, Episode 12, 2001), to Homer Simpson's misguided attempt to build a backyard court, poking fun at amateur enthusiasm and family rivalries in the sport. Documentaries have also captured tennis's emotional depth, with *Federer: Twelve Final Days* (2024), directed by Asif Kapadia and Joe Sabia, offering an intimate look at Roger Federer's retirement during the 2022 Laver Cup, blending archival footage with personal reflections from rivals like Rafael Nadal.\n\nVideo games have popularized tennis through diverse gameplay styles, appealing to simulation enthusiasts and casual players alike. The *Top Spin* series, particularly *Top Spin 4* (2011), stands out for its realistic mechanics, including detailed player animations and tactical depth that mimic professional matches. In contrast, the *Virtua Tennis* franchise, such as *Virtua Tennis 4* (2011), emphasizes fast-paced, arcade-style action with simplified controls for broad accessibility. *Mario Tennis* games, like *Mario Tennis Aces* (2018) for Nintendo Switch, incorporate crossover characters from the Mario universe into whimsical, power-up-filled courts, prioritizing fun over realism.\n\nCultural tropes in tennis media often revolve around intense rivalries and the sport's glamorous allure. Films like *Battle of the Sexes* exemplify rivalry dramas by framing matches as high-stakes battles symbolizing broader societal conflicts. Wimbledon's tradition of all-white attire and elegant spectatorship has cemented tennis's association with fashion and sophistication, influencing trends like \"tenniscore\" in contemporary media portrayals. These elements frequently draw inspiration from real players, such as the Williams sisters' resilience in *King Richard*.\n\n### Media and literature\n\nTennis has inspired a rich body of literature, encompassing both fictional narratives and journalistic accounts that delve into the sport's psychological and social dimensions. In fiction, Taylor Jenkins Reid's 2022 novel *Carrie Soto Is Back* portrays the comeback of a fictional retired tennis champion striving to reclaim her record in Grand Slam victories, emphasizing themes of ambition, aging, and personal redemption. This work highlights the intense mental and emotional demands of elite competition, reflecting broader literary explorations of athletic perseverance. In 2025, Giri Nathan's *Changeover* examined the emerging rivalry between Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner, offering insights into modern professional tennis dynamics.\n\nJournalistic works, particularly player memoirs, offer intimate insights into tennis's challenges. Andre Agassi's 2009 autobiography *Open* candidly recounts his professional journey, including his struggles with methamphetamine use, hatred for the sport, and battles with depression, bringing attention to mental health issues often concealed in professional athletics. Similarly, Jimmy Connors's 2013 memoir *The Outsider* details his aggressive playing style and personal conflicts, providing a raw look at the era's rivalries and the psychological toll of constant competition. For women's perspectives, Johnette Howard's 2005 book *The Rivals* examines the iconic rivalry between Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova, underscoring themes of gender equality and how their competition advanced pay equity and visibility for female athletes in tennis.\n\nThese literary works frequently address mental health and gender dynamics, with Agassi's revelations in *Open* sparking wider discussions on athlete well-being, as evidenced by its influence on subsequent narratives about vulnerability in sports. Billie Jean King's 2021 memoir *All In* further amplifies gender equality themes, chronicling her advocacy for equal prize money and Title IX, which transformed women's tennis and inspired ongoing fights against disparities.\n\nBeyond books, tennis enjoys robust media coverage through broadcasts and audio formats. Networks like ESPN and the BBC provide comprehensive live coverage of major events, including over 250 hours of Wimbledon programming on ESPN alone, making the sport accessible to global audiences. Podcasts have also proliferated, with *The Tennis Podcast*, launched in 2012 by David Law and Catherine Whitaker, offering weekly analysis of matches, player interviews, and cultural commentary; it was named one of Time magazine's top 100 podcasts for its insightful coverage.\n\nSocial media platforms, particularly TikTok, have amplified tennis's reach, as players share training routines, match highlights, and personal anecdotes to connect with fans. The ATP's 2024 partnership with TikTok aims to leverage this trend, with top players like those in the top 100 using the platform to grow engagement among younger demographics and humanize the sport's high-stakes world.",
