## Overview

Mexico, officially known as the United Mexican States (*Estados Unidos Mexicanos*), is a federal republic located in the southern portion of North America. It is bordered to the north by the United States, to the south and west by the Pacific Ocean, to the southeast by Guatemala, Belize, and the Caribbean Sea, and to the east by the Gulf of Mexico. Covering an area of approximately 1,964,375 square kilometers (758,449 square miles), Mexico is the 13th largest country in the world and the third largest in Latin America. Its capital, Mexico City, is one of the largest metropolitan areas globally, serving as the political, cultural, and economic heart of the nation [CIA World Factbook](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/mexico/).

As of 2023, Mexico has a population of over 128 million people, making it the 10th most populous country in the world. The country is known for its rich cultural heritage, blending Indigenous and European influences, and is a significant player in global economics, politics, and tourism. Mexico is also a biodiversity hotspot, home to a vast array of flora and fauna, and features diverse landscapes ranging from deserts to rainforests [World Bank Data](https://data.worldbank.org/country/mexico).

## Historical Background

### Pre-Columbian Era
Mexico's history stretches back thousands of years, with evidence of human habitation dating to around 10,000 BCE. The region was home to advanced Indigenous civilizations, including the Olmecs, often considered the "mother culture" of Mesoamerica (circa 1200–400 BCE), the Maya (2000 BCE–1500 CE), and the Aztecs (14th–16th centuries CE). The Maya developed sophisticated writing systems, calendars, and architecture, with notable sites like Chichen Itza and Palenque. The Aztecs, centered in Tenochtitlan (modern-day Mexico City), built a powerful empire with a complex social structure and extensive trade networks [National Geographic](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/mexico-history-culture).

### Colonial Period
In 1519, Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés arrived in Mexico, leading to the fall of the Aztec Empire by 1521. Spain established the Viceroyalty of New Spain, which became a key part of the Spanish colonial empire for nearly 300 years. During this period, European culture, language, and religion (Catholicism) were imposed on Indigenous populations, often through forced conversion and labor systems like the encomienda. This era also saw the blending of cultures, evident in Mexico's mestizo population and syncretic traditions [Encyclopedia Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/place/Mexico/History).

### Independence and Modern History
Mexico gained independence from Spain on September 27, 1821, after a decade-long war led by figures like Miguel Hidalgo and José María Morelos. The 19th century was marked by political instability, including the Mexican-American War (1846–1848), during which Mexico lost nearly half its territory to the United States, including present-day California and Texas. The 20th century saw the Mexican Revolution (1910–1920), a transformative conflict that addressed land reform and social inequality, leading to the establishment of the modern Mexican state under the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which dominated politics for much of the century [History.com](https://www.history.com/topics/latin-america/mexican-revolution).

## Current Status and Relevance

### Politics and Government
Mexico operates as a federal presidential representative democratic republic. Its government is divided into three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial. The president, elected for a single six-year term, serves as both head of state and government. Mexico comprises 31 states and one federal district (Mexico City), each with significant autonomy. While the country has made strides in democratic reforms since the late 20th century, challenges such as corruption, organized crime, and political violence persist [Freedom House](https://freedomhouse.org/country/mexico/freedom-world/2023).

### Economy
Mexico has the 15th largest economy in the world by nominal GDP, with key sectors including manufacturing, oil production, and tourism. It is a leading exporter of automobiles, electronics, and agricultural products, and is a member of the USMCA (United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement), which replaced NAFTA in 2020. Despite economic growth, income inequality and poverty remain significant issues, with many rural and Indigenous communities facing systemic challenges [World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/mexico/overview).

### Social and Cultural Landscape
Mexico is a culturally vibrant nation, known for its contributions to art, music, cuisine, and literature. Iconic figures like Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera have shaped global perceptions of Mexican art, while traditional celebrations like Día de los Muertos (Day of the Dead) highlight the country’s unique blend of Indigenous and Catholic traditions. Spanish is the official language, spoken by the vast majority, though over 60 Indigenous languages, such as Nahuatl and Maya, are recognized [UNESCO](https://en.unesco.org/creativity/policy-monitoring-platform/mexicos-multicultural-diversity).

### International Role
Mexico plays a prominent role in international affairs as a member of the United Nations, the Organization of American States (OAS), and the G20. It is a key partner in addressing issues like migration, climate change, and drug trafficking, particularly in collaboration with the United States. Mexico’s cultural influence also extends globally through its cuisine, cinema, and UNESCO World Heritage Sites, of which it has 35, one of the highest numbers in the world [UNESCO World Heritage](https://whc.unesco.org/en/statesparties/mx).
