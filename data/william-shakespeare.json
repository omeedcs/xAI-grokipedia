Shakespeare authored 38 plays, 154 sonnets, and several other poems, many of which explore timeless themes such as love, power, tragedy, and the human condition. His contributions to the English language are immense, with numerous phrases and words still in common use today attributed to his writings [Shakespeare's Influence on Language](https://www.bl.uk/shakespeare/articles/shakespeares-language). This article provides a comprehensive overview of Shakespeare’s life, works, historical context, and enduring legacy.\n\n## Historical Background\n\n### Early Life\nWilliam Shakespeare was born in Stratford-upon-Avon, a market town in Warwickshire, England. While his exact birth date is unknown, records indicate he was baptized on April 26, 1564, and it is traditionally assumed he was born on or around April 23. He was the third of eight children born to John Shakespeare, a glove-maker and local official, and Mary Arden, who came from a landowning family. Little is known about his early education, though it is likely he attended the local grammar school, where he would have studied Latin, Greek, and classical literature [Shakespeare's Early Life](https://www.folger.edu/shakespeares-life).\n\nAt the age of 18, Shakespeare married Anne Hathaway, with whom he had three children: Susanna (1583) and twins Hamnet and Judith (1585). Tragically, Hamnet died at the age of 11, an event some scholars believe influenced the emotional depth of Shakespeare’s later works [Anne Hathaway and Family](https://www.shakespeare.org.uk/explore-shakespeare/shakespedia/shakespeares-family/).\n\n### Career in London\nBy the late 1580s, Shakespeare had moved to London, where he began his career as an actor and playwright. His early works include historical plays such as *Henry VI* and comedies like *The Taming of the Shrew*. By 1594, he was a leading member of the Lord Chamberlain’s Men, a prominent acting troupe later known as the King’s Men under the patronage of King James I. This company performed at the Globe Theatre, which Shakespeare co-owned [Globe Theatre History](https://www.shakespearesglobe.com/discover/about-us/history/).\n\nShakespeare’s career spanned approximately 25 years, during which he wrote tragedies such as *Hamlet*, *Macbeth*, and *King Lear*, comedies like *A Midsummer Night’s Dream*, and romances such as *The Tempest*. His works were popular during his lifetime, though he did not achieve the near-mythical status he holds today until centuries later [Shakespeare's Career](https://www.bl.uk/shakespeare/articles/shakespeare-in-his-own-age).\n\n### Later Life and Death\nShakespeare retired to Stratford-upon-Avon around 1613, after a prolific career. He died on April 23, 1616, at the age of 52, and was buried in the chancel of Holy Trinity Church in Stratford. The cause of his death remains unknown, though theories include illness or natural causes. His epitaph, inscribed on his gravestone, famously warns against disturbing his remains [Shakespeare's Death](https://www.shakespeare.org.uk/explore-shakespeare/shakespedia/shakespeares-death/).\n\n## Current Status and Relevance\n\nShakespeare’s influence on modern literature, theater, and culture is unparalleled. His plays are performed more frequently than those of any other playwright, with productions staged worldwide in numerous languages [Shakespeare's Global Impact](https://www.britannica.com/biography/William-Shakespeare). His works are a staple of educational curricula, studied for their linguistic innovation, psychological depth, and universal themes.\n\nBeyond theater, Shakespeare’s language has permeated everyday English. Phrases such as \"break the ice,\" \"wild-goose chase,\" and \"all’s well that ends well\" originated in his writings [Common Shakespeare Phrases](https://www.nosweatshakespeare.com/resources/shakespeare-phrases/). Additionally, his stories have inspired countless adaptations in film, television, and literature, from modern retellings like *West Side Story* (based on *Romeo and Juliet*) to cinematic interpretations by directors like Kenneth Branagh and Baz Luhrmann.\n\nShakespeare also remains a subject of academic study and debate. Scholars continue to explore questions about authorship, with some proposing alternative candidates for his works, though the majority of experts affirm Shakespeare as the primary author [Authorship Debate](https://www.folger.edu/shakespeare-faq#authorship). His relevance persists in discussions of race, gender, and power, as contemporary interpretations of his plays often address modern societal issues.\n\n## Notable Facts and Details\n\n- **Prolific Output**: Shakespeare wrote approximately 38 plays, 154 sonnets, and two long narrative poems (*Venus and Adonis* and *The Rape of Lucrece*).
