  "content": "# Dua Lipa\n\nDua Lipa (born 22 August 1995) is an English singer and songwriter of Kosovar Albanian descent.\nHer self-titled debut studio album, released on 2 June 2017, peaked at number 27 on the Billboard 200 chart and featured the hit single \"New Rules,\" which propelled her to mainstream recognition.\nLipa's second album, *Future Nostalgia* (2020), achieved number-one positions on charts in over ten countries, including the United States and United Kingdom, and received critical acclaim for its disco-influenced pop sound.\nShe has won three Grammy Awards: Best New Artist and Best Dance Recording in 2019 for \"Electricity\" with Silk City, and Best Pop Vocal Album for *Future Nostalgia* in 2021.\nLipa's music career, marked by over 80 million albums and singles sold globally, has established her as one of the leading figures in contemporary pop music.\n\n## Early life\n\n### Family background and heritage\n\nDua Lipa was born on 22 August 1995 in London to parents of Kosovo Albanian ethnicity, Dukagjin Lipa and Anesa Lipa (née Rexha), who had relocated from Pristina, then part of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, to the United Kingdom in 1992 amid escalating ethnic conflicts in the Balkans.  Dukagjin, born in Pristina in 1969, initially worked as a musician, serving as lead vocalist for the Kosovar rock band Oda during the 1980s, before shifting to a career in marketing and co-founding the Sunny Hill Festival in Pristina in 2014 to promote cultural revival in Kosovo.  His father, Seit Lipa, was a noted historian who headed the Kosovo Institute of History, contributing to the documentation of Albanian heritage in the region.\n\nAnesa Lipa traces her roots to a Kosovan Albanian father and Bosnian mother, incorporating Bosniak elements into the family's heritage.  Upon settling in London, both parents entered the hospitality industry—Anesa in tourism-related roles—while Dukagjin pursued evening studies at the Chartered Institute of Marketing to support the family during their early years as immigrants. The Lipas' displacement reflected broader patterns among ethnic Albanians fleeing Yugoslav-era instability, including the lead-up to the Kosovo War, which preserved their cultural ties through language, music, and traditions despite geographical separation.\n\n### Relocation to London and formative years\n\nDua Lipa, born on August 22, 1995, in London to Kosovar Albanian parents who had fled the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia, spent her early childhood in the city before her family relocated to Pristina, Kosovo, in 2006 when she was 11 years old. The move allowed her to immerse in her Albanian heritage and attend local schooling, including Milleniumi i Tretë School, amid a culturally rich environment influenced by her father's musical background. However, recognizing limited prospects for a music career in Kosovo, Lipa returned to London alone in 2010 at age 15, residing initially with a family friend to access the city's industry opportunities.\n\nThis relocation thrust Lipa into early independence, as she balanced part-time work, including waitressing, with her ambitions, describing the transition as isolating yet motivating amid the \"limbo\" of adapting without family support. She reconnected with the Sylvia Young Theatre School, where she had studied previously, to refine performance skills, though her focus shifted toward self-directed music efforts like recording demos and building an online presence through cover uploads on platforms such as YouTube. These years honed her persistence, shaped by the duality of her bicultural experiences and the practical demands of urban London life, laying groundwork for her professional entry by 2013.\n\n## Musical career\n\n### 2013–2018: Breakthrough with debut album\n\nLipa initiated her music career in 2013 by uploading cover versions of songs by artists such as Jessie J and Joss Stone to YouTube, accumulating early online visibility. In 2014, she secured a recording contract with Warner Bros. Records UK, marking her entry into the professional music industry. Her debut single, \"New Love\", arrived on 23 August 2015, followed by \"Be the One\" on 30 October 2015, which climbed to number nine on the UK Singles Chart and gained traction in multiple European markets. \n\nSubsequent releases \"Hotter than Hell\" in October 2016 and \"Blow Your Mind (Mwah)\" in early 2017, along with \"Room 4 Two\" and \"Thinking 'Bout You\", sustained momentum, with the former peaking at number 15 on the UK chart. Lipa's self-titled debut studio album, characterized by dance-pop and electropop elements, was issued on 2 June 2017 via Warner Bros. Records.  The record reached number three on the UK Albums Chart and number 27 on the US Billboard 200 in February 2018. \n\nThe album's promotion intensified with \"New Rules\", initially released as a promotional single in July 2017 but achieving commercial release in November, topping the UK Singles Chart for four weeks and reaching number six on the US Billboard Hot 100.  \"IDGAF\", issued in January 2018, peaked at number three in the UK, bolstering the album's visibility. Lipa's breakthrough garnered critical and commercial acclaim, evidenced by five nominations at the 2018 Brit Awards, including Album of the Year, where she secured wins for British Female Solo Artist and British Breakthrough Act. \n\n### 2019–2022: Future Nostalgia and global expansion\n\nIn November 2019, Dua Lipa released \"Don't Start Now\" as the lead single from her second studio album, which debuted at number two on the UK Singles Chart and reached number two on the Billboard Hot 100. On December 2, 2019, she announced the Future Nostalgia Tour, initially scheduled for April to June 2020 across the UK and Europe with 24 shows. The promotional single \"Future Nostalgia\" followed on December 13, 2019, previewing the album's disco-influenced sound.\n\nFuture Nostalgia was released on March 27, 2020, by Warner Records, featuring production collaborations with Jeff Bhasker, Ian Kirkpatrick, and Stuart Price. The album debuted at number two on the UK Albums Chart with 34,390 units sold in its first week and peaked at number four on the Billboard 200, marking Lipa's highest US chart entry at the time. Follow-up singles included \"Physical\" in January 2020, which topped charts in 11 countries, and \"Break My Heart\" in March 2020, reaching number 13 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nDespite the COVID-19 pandemic disrupting live events, Future Nostalgia achieved sustained commercial success, becoming the longest-running top 10 album by a female artist on the Billboard 200 in 2020 and the year's most streamed album globally on platforms like Spotify. \"Levitating,\" released as a single in October 2020, later became the album's biggest hit, peaking at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 and earning a quadruple platinum certification from the RIAA for 4 million units in the US. The album itself received a platinum certification from the RIAA in March 2021 for 1 million equivalent units sold in the US. By mid-2022, it had accumulated over 11.5 million equivalent album units worldwide.\n\nThe Future Nostalgia Tour was postponed three times due to the pandemic, finally commencing in February 2022 with North American dates supported by Caroline Polachek, Lolo Zouaï, and Megan Thee Stallion on select shows. The leg grossed $40 million from reported shows, extending to Europe in April, South America, and festivals like Rock in Rio in September 2022. In September 2020, Lipa released a remix album, Club Future Nostalgia, featuring electronic reworks to maintain momentum during lockdowns.\n\nAt the 63rd Grammy Awards in March 2021, Future Nostalgia won Best Pop Vocal Album, with \"Don't Start Now\" nominated for Best Pop Solo Performance; the album was also nominated for Album of the Year. Lipa swept the Brit Awards in May 2021, winning British Album, British Female Solo Artist, and British Single for \"Don't Start Now.\" These accolades, alongside over 1 billion Spotify streams for tracks like \"Levitating,\" underscored the album's role in expanding Lipa's international fanbase beyond Europe and North America into Latin America and Asia through digital platforms and virtual performances.\n\n### 2023–present: Radical Optimism, tours, and Grammy recognition\n\nDua Lipa released the lead single \"Houdini\" from her third studio album on November 9, 2023, marking the beginning of the promotional cycle for *Radical Optimism*. The album, comprising 11 tracks, followed with additional singles including \"Training Season\" on February 15, 2024, and \"Illusion\" on April 11, 2024. *Radical Optimism* was issued on May 3, 2024, via Warner Records, incorporating disco-influenced pop elements developed during Lipa's personal reflections post-*Future Nostalgia*. It debuted at number 2 on the Billboard 200 chart, selling 102,000 equivalent album units in its first week in the United States.\n\nThe *Radical Optimism Tour* launched in support of the album, beginning with dates in Europe and Asia in mid-2024 before expanding globally. Key legs included performances across North America starting September 1, 2025, at Scotiabank Arena in Toronto, and extending through October 16, 2025, at Climate Pledge Arena in Seattle. The tour schedule also featured South American shows, such as multiple nights at Estadio River Plate in Buenos Aires on November 7 and 8, 2025. These concerts emphasized high-energy production with setlists drawing heavily from *Radical Optimism* alongside prior hits, grossing significant revenue amid sold-out arenas.\n\nDespite the album's commercial performance, *Radical Optimism* received no nominations at the 67th Annual Grammy Awards in 2025, a notable omission in major categories like Album of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album. Lipa, who had previously secured three Grammy wins from 10 nominations, responded by expressing satisfaction with the strong female artist representation among nominees. The lack of recognition contrasted with the album's chart success and tour momentum, highlighting variances between commercial metrics and Recording Academy selections.\n\n## Acting and media ventures\n\n### Film debut and roles\n\nDua Lipa's acting debut occurred in the 2024 spy thriller *Argylle*, directed by Matthew Vaughn, where she portrayed the character LaGrange, a seductive operative involved in an opening sequence featuring flirtation and action alongside Henry Cavill's Argylle. The role marked her entry into feature film acting, with production announcements dating back to 2021 emphasizing it as her first substantial screen performance in a cast including Cavill, Bryce Dallas Howard, and Samuel L. Jackson. Vaughn selected Lipa for the part after encountering her in a music video, prioritizing her natural charisma over prior acting experience.\n\nPrior to *Argylle*'s release, Lipa made a brief cameo appearance in Greta Gerwig's *Barbie* (2023) as Mermaid Barbie, a blue-haired character in a fantastical underwater sequence shared with co-stars including John Cena as a fish. This uncredited role, filmed alongside her contribution of the soundtrack single \"Dance the Night,\" lasted mere moments but highlighted her integration into ensemble casts of high-profile productions. Lipa has described both early roles as introductory \"baby steps\" in acting, expressing intent to pursue more serious opportunities following the visibility gained from these projects. As of 2025, no additional feature film or television roles have been confirmed beyond these.\n\n### Other entertainment projects and endorsements\n\nDua Lipa hosted the May 4, 2024, episode of *Saturday Night Live*, performing sketches alongside musical performances of her singles \"Illusion\" and \"Houdini\" from *Radical Optimism*. This marked her first time hosting the program, following prior appearances as a musical guest in 2018 and 2020.\n\nIn December 2024, Lipa headlined the concert special *An Evening with Dua Lipa*, broadcast on ITV1 in the UK on December 8 and featuring live renditions of tracks from her third studio album, emphasizing themes of vulnerability and intensity in her performances. A version of the special also aired on CBS in the US, highlighting her expanded presence in televised entertainment formats beyond standard music promotions.\n\nLipa co-founded the production company Radical22, which manages her career and has ventured into media production, including executive producing the Disney+ documentary *Camden* in 2024, a project exploring London's music scene. In August 2025, she established TwentyTwo Films Limited with actor Callum Turner, focusing on film and television development. These initiatives represent her shift toward behind-the-scenes roles in entertainment content creation.\n\nLipa has secured multiple high-profile brand endorsements, beginning with a multi-year global partnership with Puma announced in 2020, which included sponsoring her \"Studio 2054\" virtual concert. She became an ambassador for Yves Saint Laurent in 2019, promoting the Libre fragrance and later expanding to global makeup campaigns in 2024. Versace appointed her as a brand ambassador for Autumn/Winter 2021, leading to runway appearances, campaign features, and a co-designed \"La Vacanza\" collection in 2023. In July 2023, she signed a seven-figure deal with Porsche, positioning her as a face for the luxury automaker following prior ties to Jaguar. Additional collaborations include Pepe Jeans and early partnerships with adidas and MAC Cosmetics.\n\n## Artistry\n\n### Musical style and production\n\nDua Lipa's music is characterized as dance-pop with prominent disco and synth-pop elements, evolving from retro-infused pop on her 2017 self-titled debut album to more pronounced 1980s-inspired disco revival on *Future Nostalgia* (2020). The debut features straightforward pop structures with modern production layered over nostalgic sounds, including tracks like \"New Rules\" that emphasize empowering lyrics and catchy hooks. *Future Nostalgia* incorporates house, electro swing, and psychedelic influences alongside lush strings and piano chords, blending vintage disco grooves with contemporary electronic textures for a \"festival-ready\" sound.\n\nHer third album, *Radical Optimism* (2024), shifts toward optimistic dance-pop with techno and experimental synth elements, drawing from influences like Tame Impala while maintaining short songs, big hooks, and adaptable lyrics typical of bounded pop conventions. Production techniques across albums utilize synthesizers, drum machines, and keyboards to create futuristic appeals, as seen in *Future Nostalgia*'s fusion of funk, synth-pop, and R\\u0026B for deeper soundscapes. Tracks like \"Don't Start Now\" employ handclaps, cowbells, synth bursts, and accented strings, developed through collaborative sessions emphasizing sophisticated arrangements, harmonies, and modal interchange.\n\nLipa collaborates with producers such as Ian Kirkpatrick, who co-wrote and produced hits originating from remote sessions, and Kevin Parker for later works, prioritizing expensive, polished pop with retro-futuristic pulses over genre constraints. This approach results in versatile, replayable records that navigate independence-themed lyrics with bold vocal delivery and genre-blending production.\n\n### Influences and vocal technique\n\nDua Lipa's musical influences originated in her family environment, where her father, Dukagjin Lipa, fronted the Kosovan rock band Oda and introduced her to rock elements through home performances. She has specifically credited her father's influence for shaping her appreciation of artists like the Police and David Bowie. Her parents also played feel-good tracks from Jamiroquai and Blondie during her childhood, contributing to an eclectic foundation blending rock, funk, and pop.\n\nFor her 2020 album *Future Nostalgia*, Lipa drew from 1980s and 1990s acts including Prince, OutKast, Gwen Stefani's early solo work, and No Doubt, emphasizing juxtaposition of styles to create a \"dancercise\" vibe with mature, conceptual pop. These influences aligned with broader disco and synth-pop revivals, as seen in the album's production, which echoed late-night Radio 1 mixes from her London youth. Her 2024 album *Radical Optimism* incorporated British band aesthetics and optimistic electronic sounds, reflecting a shift toward joy amid personal growth.\n\nLipa possesses a mezzo-soprano vocal range spanning roughly three octaves, from G#2 to A5, characterized by a dark, raspy, and smoky timbre effective for sultry, attitude-driven delivery in dance-pop contexts. Her technique relies on mixed voice for seamless chest-to-head transitions, incorporating twang and modal qualities to add edge and projection without heavy belting. Early experiences, such as a school choir audition rejection after struggling with high notes, prompted her to prioritize her lower register's husky depth over upper extension.\n\nWhile not renowned for vocal acrobatics or wide dynamic range, Lipa's style emphasizes breathy phrasing, rhythmic syncopation, and charisma, amplified by studio effects like short-decay reverb for spatial clarity in mixes. Live performances demonstrate competence in her comfort zone but reveal limitations in agility compared to peers, with success deriving more from stylistic confidence and production synergy than raw technical virtuosity.\n\n## Commercial success\n\n### Chart performance and sales figures\n\nDua Lipa's recordings have achieved substantial commercial success, with equivalent album sales exceeding 50 million units worldwide as of 2025, encompassing pure sales, streaming equivalents, and track sales. Her catalog has amassed over 38 billion streams as lead artist on Spotify alone.\n\nHer eponymous debut album, released in 2017, generated 20.8 million equivalent album units globally, ranking as her highest-selling release to date. It peaked at number one on the UK Albums Chart and reached number three on the US Billboard 200. Certifications include multi-platinum status in multiple territories, reflecting strong physical and digital sales alongside streaming accumulation.\n\n| Album              | UK Peak | US Billboard 200 Peak | Global Equivalent Units (millions) |\n|--------------------|---------|-----------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Dua Lipa (2017)   | 1      | 3                     | 20.8                              |\n| Future Nostalgia (2020) | 1      | 4                     | 11.5                              |\n| Radical Optimism (2024) | 1      | 2                     | ~3 (estimated early figures)      |\n\nFuture Nostalgia, her second studio album, has sold over 11.5 million equivalent units worldwide, bolstered by hits like \"Don't Start Now\" and \"Levitating.\" It debuted at number one in the UK with 34,390 units in its first week and number four on the Billboard 200, later certified platinum in the US for one million units. In the US, it surpassed five million units by 2025, driven by streaming resurgence around its fifth anniversary. Radical Optimism debuted at number one in the UK—her first such opening week increase of 35% over prior albums—and number two on the Billboard 200, with 51,500 pure sales in its US debut week.\n\nSingles performance has been pivotal, with \"Levitating\" earning RIAA Diamond certification for 10 million US units in sales and streams as of November 2023. \"Don't Start Now\" peaked at number two on both the UK Singles Chart and US Billboard Hot 100, accumulating over three billion Spotify streams. Other singles like \"New Rules\" from the debut reached number one in the UK, while \"Houdini\" and \"Dance the Night Now\" from Radical Optimism secured top-five UK positions.\n\n| Single             | UK Peak | US Hot 100 Peak | Spotify Streams (billions) | US Certification |\n|--------------------|---------|-----------------|----------------------------|------------------|\n| New Rules (2017)  | 1      | 6               | 1.8                       | 2× Platinum     |\n| Don't Start Now (2019) | 2      | 2               | 3.1                       | 4× Platinum     |\n| Levitating (2020) | 2      | 2               | 2.4                       | Diamond (10×)   |\n| Houdini (2023)    | 1      | 29              | 0.7                       | Gold            |\n\nThese figures underscore Lipa's dominance in streaming-era metrics, where equivalents heavily weight digital consumption over traditional sales.\n\n### Awards, nominations, and records\n\nDua Lipa has received three Grammy Awards from ten nominations, including Best New Artist and Best Dance Recording for \"Electricity\" (with Silk City) at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards on February 10, 2019, and Best Pop Vocal Album for *Future Nostalgia* at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards on March 14, 2021. At the 67th Annual Grammy Awards, she earned nominations for Song of the Year and Best Song Written for Visual Media for \"Dance the Night\" from the *Barbie* soundtrack.\n\nShe has won seven Brit Awards, including British Female Solo Artist and British Breakthrough Act in 2018, British Album of the Year and British Female Solo Artist for *Future Nostalgia* in 2021, Best Pop/R\\u0026B Act in 2022, and Pop Act in 2024. Among her five Billboard Music Awards, Lipa received Top Dance/Electronic Song for \"Houdini\" at the 2024 ceremony on December 12.\n\nLipa holds two Guinness World Records: the most tickets sold for a livestreamed concert by a solo female artist in a current year, with 284,000 for her Studio 2054 performance on November 27, 2020, in London; and the most-streamed album on Spotify by a female artist, her self-titled debut album, surpassing 11.9 billion streams as recognized in records up to 2024. Her single \"Levitating\" achieved RIAA Diamond certification on November 6, 2023, denoting 10 million units in the United States and marking the first such certification for a song by a lead female vocalist in over a decade.\n\n## Public image and fashion\n\n### Style evolution and endorsements\n\nDua Lipa's early fashion style, from her 2015 debut single \"New Love\" through 2020, drew from London street culture and early 2010s Tumblr aesthetics, featuring edgy elements like oversized bomber jackets, leather trousers, and chunky boots that reflected a raw, Gen Z-influenced vibe. By 2017, as her profile rose with hits like \"New Rules,\" she transitioned to more structured eveningwear, incorporating opulent gowns from designers such as Versace and Chanel for red carpet appearances, marking a shift from casual daywear to high-fashion statements.\n\nIn 2021, amid the promotion of *Future Nostalgia*, Lipa's aesthetic evolved toward retro-futurist glamour with disco-inspired iridescent fabrics and avant-garde pieces from Mugler and Vivienne Westwood, emphasizing polished pop-star sophistication. This progressed in 2022 with vibrant, thematic designs like chainmail bikinis tied to her Versace collaboration, blending Mediterranean and rave influences. By 2023, during the *Radical Optimism* era, her looks incorporated surreal, sculptural stage elements from LOEWE alongside sharp tailoring, while 2024 and 2025 saw a refinement into minimalism with architectural silhouettes and muted palettes, aligning with her role as co-founder and chief creative officer at FRAME denim.\n\nLipa's endorsement portfolio began notably in 2018 with Jaguar's I-PACE electric vehicle campaign, featuring a remix of her track \"Want To.\" She became Yves Saint Laurent Beauté's fragrance ambassador for Libre in June 2019, starring in campaigns like \"The New Fragrance of Freedom,\" and expanded to makeup ambassadorship in February 2024 with launches including Loveshine Lip Oil Stick. In November 2020, she signed a multi-year deal with Puma as a global ambassador, involving campaigns and projects tied to her \"Studio 2054\" performance.\n\nFurther deals included a seven-figure partnership with Porsche in 2023 and a co-design collaboration with Versace for the \"La Vacanza\" women's collection, which debuted on May 23, 2023, in Cannes as a see-now-buy-now resort line celebrating Italian summer escapes. Additional endorsements encompass Mugler, Evian, and Pepe Jeans, contributing to her reported £75 million empire through fashion and lifestyle integrations.\n\n### Modeling career and brand collaborations\n\nDua Lipa began her modeling pursuits as a teenager in London, securing early gigs with high-street brands such as ASOS and Topshop around 2013 while balancing part-time jobs in restaurants and nightclubs to support herself at age 16. During this period, she encountered industry pressures, including body-shaming comments from agents who criticized her physique despite her confidence in her natural form, which contributed to a challenging entry into the field before she shifted focus to music in 2014. These experiences informed her later approach to public image, blending resilience with a polished aesthetic honed from fashion world exposure.\n\nAs her music career gained traction, Lipa transitioned into high-profile brand partnerships, starting with Pepe Jeans' spring/summer 2019 campaign, where she starred as the face of their denim-focused advertising efforts targeting a youthful demographic. In 2023, she co-designed the \"La Vacanza\" womenswear capsule collection with Donatella Versace, featuring resort-inspired pieces like crochet tops and printed dresses, which debuted via an exclusive runway show at the Cannes Film Festival on May 23. This marked her first foray into active design collaboration, emphasizing vacation-ready versatility.\n\nSubsequent endorsements included Yves Saint Laurent Beauté's Loveshine lip product line in April 2024, where Lipa promoted sheer, hydrating formulas aligned with her signature bold yet effortless makeup style. In March 2025, she became the face of Chanel's CHANEL 25 handbag campaign alongside BLACKPINK's Jennie, showcasing the structured leather totes in urban and studio settings to highlight their modern, minimalist appeal as a House friend. These collaborations have collectively amplified her influence in luxury fashion, leveraging her 88 million Instagram followers for global reach while prioritizing campaigns that reflect her personal aesthetic of confident, dancefloor-ready glamour.\n\n## Activism and political engagement\n\n### Social and humanitarian advocacy\n\nLipa co-founded the Sunny Hill Foundation with her father, Dukagjin Lipa, in Pristina, Kosovo, to combat poverty and injustice while advancing arts, culture, education, social inclusion, and mental health initiatives. The organization has funded 15 partner groups in these domains. Proceeds from the annual Sunny Hill Festival, organized by Lipa, have directed funds to the foundation, including a €100,000 donation.\n\nIn April 2019, Lipa collaborated with UNICEF on a trip to Lebanon, where she engaged with refugee children and youth displaced by regional conflicts to spotlight their challenges and UNICEF's aid programs. In June 2025, she partnered again with UNICEF, allocating tour revenue to scholarships enabling education for Kosovo girls confronting access barriers.\n\nLipa endorses The Circle, a group targeting women's empowerment, global feminism, and poverty reduction, including efforts to curb violence against women. In March 2019, she contributed to their International Women's Day campaign underscoring legal gaps in domestic violence protections affecting 603 million women worldwide.\n\nShe has championed greater female involvement in music production and engineering, critiquing industry underrepresentation. In her February 2018 Brit Awards speech for British Female Solo Artist, Lipa acknowledged trailblazing women predecessors and urged ongoing progress for female artists. Lipa extended this to defending women's occupational choices, asserting in a 2021 interview that feminists should back women in fields like stripping.\n\nIn mental health advocacy, Lipa earned The Trevor Project's 2024 Mental Health Champion of the Year award for promoting LGBTQ+ rights and sharing personal struggles to destigmatize the topic.\n\n### Positions on geopolitical issues\n\nDua Lipa, of Kosovar Albanian heritage, has expressed strong support for Albanian cultural and national unity in the Balkans. In July 2020, she posted an image on social media depicting a map of \"Greater Albania,\" encompassing territories in Kosovo, North Macedonia, Montenegro, and Serbia inhabited by ethnic Albanians, which she intended to celebrate Albanian unity amid tensions between Albania and Serbia; the post drew criticism from Serbian officials and others for promoting expansionist nationalism. She received Albanian citizenship in November 2022 from President Bajram Begaj for elevating Albanian visibility globally through her music and advocacy, and Kosovan citizenship in August 2025, which she described as unifying her British and Balkan identities.\n\nOn the Israel-Palestine conflict, Lipa has voiced unequivocal support for Palestinians, condemning Israeli military actions in Gaza as \"genocide\" in a May 2024 Instagram post to her 88 million followers, stating that \"burning children alive can never be justified\" in reference to airstrikes on displacement camps. She signed an open letter in May 2025 with over 300 British figures, including actors Benedict Cumberbatch and Brian Eno, urging Prime Minister Keir Starmer to impose an arms embargo on Israel and recognize Palestine. In June 2024, Lipa defended her statements in a Radio Times interview, asserting they served the \"greater good\" despite potential career risks, and emphasized her personal connection to global injustices rooted in her family's experience fleeing the Kosovo War. Reports in September 2025 claimed she dismissed an agent for signing a letter opposing the Glastonbury performance of pro-Palestinian Irish band Kneecap, interpreting it as support for Israel's Gaza operations, though Lipa denied the firing was due to pro-Israel views, clarifying they had not collaborated professionally for years while reiterating her pro-Palestine stance and accusing media of exploiting the conflict for \"clickbait.\" In October 2025, she affirmed readiness to endure harassment or professional repercussions for advocating Palestine.\n\nRegarding Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Lipa pledged solidarity in February 2022 via Instagram Stories, condemning Vladimir Putin's \"war of aggression\" and promoting donations for medical supplies and humanitarian aid through her platform Service95, framing it as support for Ukraine's fight for freedom and democracy. In a May 2024 Guardian interview, she grouped the Ukraine conflict with Gaza and Sudan as exemplars of global injustices to which she feels \"very close,\" citing her refugee background as heightening her empathy for war-affected populations.\n\n### Criticisms and backlash\n\nDua Lipa has faced backlash for her public support of Kosovo's independence and Albanian heritage, particularly after tweeting a map depicting a \"Greater Albania\" on July 19, 2020, in response to Apple Maps not recognizing Kosovo as a sovereign state. The post, which included the caption \"Kosovo / #Independent / #Heritage / #Indigenous,\" was interpreted by critics, including Serbian officials and media, as endorsing territorial expansionism into parts of Serbia, North Macedonia, Montenegro, and Greece, aligning with historical nationalist ideologies. Lipa, whose parents are Kosovar Albanians who fled the 1990s Kosovo War, later clarified that her intent was to advocate for Kosovo's recognition rather than irredentism, stating the map symbolized cultural unity among Albanians rather than political borders. The controversy drew condemnation from Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić, who called it \"dangerous,\" and prompted diplomatic tensions, highlighting divisions over Balkan history where Albanian diaspora figures like Lipa amplify narratives of self-determination against Serbian claims of sovereignty.\n\nHer vocal criticism of Israel's military actions in Gaza has also generated significant opposition, including accusations of antisemitism from pro-Israel advocates. In June 2024, Lipa described Israel's operations as \"genocide\" in interviews, expressing willingness to \"take the hit\" for speaking out on Palestinian rights, a stance she linked to her family's experiences of displacement during the Kosovo conflict. This drew rebukes, such as a full-page advertisement in *The New York Times* by Rabbi Shmuley Boteach condemning her views, and references in an Israeli drill rap track advocating violence against celebrities supporting Palestine. Lipa maintained that her positions stem from a commitment to human rights and ending \"injustices and inequality,\" undeterred by potential career repercussions in markets sensitive to the issue. Such statements have polarized fans, with some praising her for addressing geopolitical conflicts amid her pop career, while others, particularly in Western and Israeli audiences, view them as one-sided given Hamas's role in initiating the October 7, 2023, attacks that escalated the war.\n\nPerformance-related criticisms have centered on allegations of lip-syncing during live shows, notably her headline set at Glastonbury Festival on June 28, 2024. Viewers on BBC broadcasts accused her of miming tracks like \"New Rules\" and \"Levitating,\" citing perceived mismatches between vocals and mouth movements amid the event's sound challenges from windy conditions. Lipa refuted the claims, asserting \"I don't mime\" and emphasizing her live vocal delivery over pre-recorded backing tracks, a standard practice in high-production pop performances to ensure reliability. Similar scrutiny arose in prior tours, where detractors questioned her vocal consistency under demanding choreography, though supporters pointed to her training and successful arena residencies as evidence of capability.\n\nLipa has also encountered plagiarism lawsuits over her music, though she has prevailed in court. In 2022, she faced suits alleging \"Levitating\" (2020) copied elements from Artikal Sound System's \"Live Your Life\" (2017) and L. Russell Brown's \"If Only\" (1979), with claimants arguing unauthorized sampling of basslines and melodies. A U.S. court ruled in her favor in March 2025, finding no substantial similarity after Lipa's team demonstrated independent creation and genre conventions in disco-influenced pop. These cases underscore broader debates in music copyright, where pop artists blending retro sounds often face claims, but Lipa's legal victories mitigated reputational damage compared to unresolved disputes for peers.\n\n## Personal life\n\n### Romantic relationships\n\nDua Lipa was in an on-and-off relationship with British model and chef Isaac Carew from 2013 to 2019.  The pair, who met before Lipa's rise to fame, split amicably in early 2019 after Carew reportedly struggled with her increasing celebrity status and touring schedule.\n\nIn 2017, during a brief separation from Carew, Lipa dated American singer Paul Klein of the band Lany for several months.  Their romance, which overlapped with Lipa's promotion of her debut album, ended in early 2018 without public details on the cause.\n\nLipa began dating model Anwar Hadid, younger brother of Gigi and Bella Hadid, in June 2019 after initiating contact via direct message. The couple marked their one-year anniversary in June 2020 and adopted a dog named Dexter together in July of that year.  They separated in late 2021, with sources citing the challenges of long-distance due to Lipa's touring commitments as a primary factor. \n\nIn September 2022, Lipa was briefly linked to French-Greek filmmaker Romain Gavras following public appearances together, including at the Saint Laurent Fashion Week in Paris in March 2023.  The relationship ended in December 2023, reportedly as Lipa prioritized her music career amid album preparations.\n\nLipa has been in a relationship with British actor Callum Turner since January 2024, after meeting at a Los Angeles party.  The couple confirmed their engagement in June 2025 via Lipa's interview in British Vogue, describing it as a \"special feeling\" after over a year together.  They have since appeared together at events, including the 2025 Glastonbury Festival.\n\n### Lifestyle and residences\n\nDua Lipa owns a Victorian-era property in Hampstead, London, purchased for £6.75 million in 2017, which serves as her primary residence. The home includes distinctive interior features such as a raw brick accent wall, a mosaic-tiled entryway, and a multicolored sofa. In 2024, construction commenced on major renovations, incorporating a basement extension with an indoor swimming pool and cinema room, after resolving a three-year legal dispute with local authorities. \n\nIn the United States, Lipa maintains a $2.5 million contemporary residence in Studio City, California, characterized by modern interiors and open layouts. She also acquired the Tyler House in California, a mid-20th-century modernist structure designed by architect John Lautner, noted for its organic integration with the landscape. As of September 2025, Lipa and her fiancé Callum Turner were seeking an additional holiday property in a sunny Mediterranean location, with a reported budget of up to £9 million.\n\nLipa follows a structured fitness routine, training at the gym three to four times weekly for approximately one-hour sessions that combine high-intensity interval training (HIIT) exercises like mountain climbers, jumping jacks, burpees, donkey kicks, bicycle crunches, and pulsing leg raises with yoga, Pilates, and boxing.  Her diet prioritizes low-carbohydrate intake during tours, featuring meals such as steak paired with vegetables to sustain energy for performances, while off-tour habits include breakfasts of eggs or fruit, pre-workout cashew butter with banana, and lunches like chicken salad.  She emphasizes recovery periods between workouts and mindful eating practices, including meal preparation, to maintain physical conditioning amid a demanding schedule.\n\n## Discography\n\n### Studio albums\n\n*Dua Lipa* is the eponymous debut studio album by English singer Dua Lipa, released on 2 June 2017 through Warner Bros. Records. The record peaked at number three on the UK Albums Chart and number 27 on the US Billboard 200. It has been certified double platinum in the United Kingdom by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for 600,000 units shipped and platinum in the United States by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for 1,000,000 units.\n\nThe album's sound draws from electropop and dance-pop influences, featuring production from contributors including Pop \\u0026 Oak and Digital Farm Animals. Key singles such as \"New Rules\" propelled its commercial success, with the title track accumulating over 18 million equivalent units worldwide by mid-2024 according to comprehensive sales estimates.\n\n*Future Nostalgia*, Lipa's second studio album, was released on 27 March 2020 by Warner Records. It debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart, marking her first chart-topping album there, and reached number four on the US Billboard 200. The project earned platinum certification in the United States from the RIAA on 10 March 2021 and double platinum in the United Kingdom from the BPI as of November 2022 for 600,000 units. Characterized by disco revival elements and 1980s-inspired synth-pop, it includes hits like \"Don't Start Now\" and has generated over 759,000 sales in the UK alone by July 2024.\n\n*Radical Optimism*, her third studio album, arrived on 3 May 2024 via Warner Records. It debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart—her second consecutive leader there—and number two on the US Billboard 200, her highest US chart position to date. Incorporating psychedelic pop, house, and trip-hop influences inspired by 1990s and 2000s club music, the album features production from Kevin Parker of Tame Impala and was preceded by singles \"Houdini\" and \"Training Season,\" both reaching the UK top five. As of October 2025, it lacks major certifications in key markets due to its recency but contributed to Lipa's overall UK certified units exceeding 29 million.\n\n| Album              | Release date | UK peak | US peak | UK certification | US certification |\n|--------------------|--------------|---------|---------|------------------|------------------|\n| *Dua Lipa*        | 2 June 2017 | 3      | 27     | 2× Platinum     | Platinum        |\n| *Future Nostalgia*| 27 March 2020| 1      | 4      | 2× Platinum     | Platinum        |\n| *Radical Optimism*| 3 May 2024  | 1      | 2      | —               | —               |\n\n### Singles and collaborations\n\nDua Lipa's debut single \"New Love\" was released in August 2015, marking her entry into the music industry, though it achieved modest chart success. Her follow-up singles from the self-titled debut album era, including \"Hotter Than Hell\" (peaking at No. 15 on the UK Singles Chart in 2016) and \"Be the One\" (No. 9 in 2016), gained traction in Europe and laid groundwork for broader recognition. The album's sixth single, \"New Rules\" (November 2017), became her first UK No. 1, holding the position for two weeks and accumulating 66 weeks on the chart, while also reaching the top five on the US Billboard Hot 100. \"IDGAF\" (2018) followed, peaking at No. 3 in the UK.\n\nIn the *Future Nostalgia* era, lead single \"Don't Start Now\" (November 2019) marked her commercial peak, reaching No. 2 on both the UK chart (67 weeks) and US Hot 100, becoming her longest-running UK top 10 single by a British female artist. Subsequent singles \"Physical\" (No. 3 UK, 2020), \"Break My Heart\" (No. 6 UK), and \"Levitating\" (No. 5 UK, No. 2 US Hot 100) propelled the album to global dominance, with \"Levitating\" logging over 70 weeks on the Hot 100 by early 2022. \"Love Again\" (2021) peaked lower at No. 51 UK but gained retroactive streaming success. For the 2024 album *Radical Optimism*, singles included \"Houdini\" (No. 2 UK, 2023), \"Training Season\" (No. 4 UK, 2024), \"Illusion\" (No. 9 UK), and \"These Walls\" (No. 40 UK).\n\n| Single | Release Year | UK Peak | US Hot 100 Peak | Album |\n|--------|--------------|---------|-----------------|--------|\n| Don't Start Now | 2019 | 2 | 2 | Future Nostalgia |\n| Levitating | 2020 | 5 | 2 | Future Nostalgia |\n| Houdini | 2023 | 2 | 5 (implied top hit) | Radical Optimism |\n| Dance the Night | 2023 | 1 | 2 (implied) | Barbie soundtrack |\n\nDua Lipa has frequently collaborated on singles, with roughly half of her US Hot 100 entries involving featured artists or duets by March 2025. Early collaborations include \"No Lie\" with Sean Paul (No. 10 UK, 2016) and \"Scared to Be Lonely\" with Martin Garrix (No. 14 UK, 2017). \"One Kiss\" with Calvin Harris topped the UK chart for eight weeks in 2018, her longest No. 1 tenure. \"Electricity\" with Silk City (Diplo and Mark Ronson) reached No. 4 UK in 2018, while \"Kiss and Make Up\" with Blackpink peaked at No. 36 UK. Later hits encompass \"Un Día (One Day)\" with J Balvin and Bad Bunny (2020), \"Prisoner\" with Miley Cyrus (No. 8 UK), \"Cold Heart (PNAU Remix)\" with Elton John (UK No. 1, 2021), \"Sweetest Pie\" with Megan Thee Stallion (2022), \"Potion\" with Calvin Harris and Young Thug (No. 16 UK), and \"Dance the Night\" from the *Barbie* soundtrack (UK No. 1, 2023). These partnerships have expanded her reach across genres, from electronic dance to hip-hop and pop-rock remixes.\n\n## Filmography\n\n### Feature films\n\nLipa made her acting debut in the 2023 fantasy comedy film *Barbie*, directed by Greta Gerwig and released on July 21, 2023, where she portrayed Mermaid Barbie in a brief cameo appearance as a blue-haired underwater variant of the character. The role marked her first on-screen performance in a major theatrical release, alongside her contribution of the original song \"Dance the Night\" to the soundtrack.\n\nIn 2024, she appeared in the spy action comedy *Argylle*, directed by Matthew Vaughn and released on February 2, 2024, playing Lagrange, a flirtatious and dangerous operative introduced in the film's opening sequence involving a dance and confrontation with Henry Cavill's character. Lipa has referred to both *Barbie* and *Argylle* roles as her initial \"little baby roles,\" indicating small but pivotal early forays into acting amid her primary career in music. As of October 2025, no additional feature film acting credits have been announced.\n\n### Television and other appearances\n\nDua Lipa first gained prominent television exposure through performances on major music award shows and late-night programs. On 21 February 2018, she performed at the Brit Awards, securing wins for British Female Solo Artist and British Breakthrough Act.\n\nShe debuted as a musical guest on *Saturday Night Live* on 3 February 2018, during the episode hosted by Natalie Portman. Lipa returned to the program on 19 December 2020, performing \"Don't Start Now\" and \"Levitating\" on the episode hosted by Kristen Wiig.\n\nIn August 2020, Lipa guest-hosted *Jimmy Kimmel Live!*, conducting interviews with celebrities such as Gwen Stefani and conducting a segment featuring elderly fans unaware of her music.\n\nOn 4 May 2024, Lipa hosted *Saturday Night Live* for the first time while also serving as musical guest, performing tracks \"Illusion\" and \"Happy for You\" from her album *Radical Optimism*.\n\nLipa starred in the television special *An Evening with Dua Lipa* in 2024, featuring live performances from the Royal Albert Hall.\n\n## Concert tours\n\n### Headlining tours\n\nDua Lipa's debut headlining concert tour, known as the Self-Titled Tour, supported her eponymous first studio album and marked her initial run as a lead act following prior opening slots. The tour launched on October 5, 2017, at Brighton Dome in Brighton, United Kingdom, encompassing over 100 shows across theaters and arenas in Europe and North America, with an extension into summer 2018 that included U.S. dates from Houston on June 5 to Toronto on July 30.\n\nHer second headlining outing, the Future Nostalgia Tour, promoted her sophomore album *Future Nostalgia* and represented her first major arena-focused production, featuring elaborate staging with disco-era aesthetics and choreography. It commenced on February 9, 2022, at Kaseya Center in Miami, Florida, and concluded after 80 performances worldwide, including key stops at Madison Square Garden in New York and The Forum in Los Angeles, generating $101.4 million in ticket revenue from 1,310,602 attendees.\n\nThe Radical Optimism Tour, backing her third studio album *Radical Optimism*, began select dates in late 2024 and expanded into a full global run, with the North American leg starting September 1, 2025, at Scotiabank Arena in Toronto, Ontario. As of October 2025, the tour remains active, featuring multiple-night stands at venues like Madison Square Garden and Kia Forum, alongside international extensions through South America into November, such as two shows at Estadio River Plate in Buenos Aires on November 7 and 8.\n\n### Promotional performances\n\nIn support of her debut self-titled album, Lipa released the Spotify Sessions EP on July 8, 2016, featuring live recordings of tracks like \"Last Dance\" and \"Hotter Than Hell\" performed acoustically. Later that year, she issued the Live Acoustic EP on December 8, 2017, which included stripped-down versions of \"New Rules\" alongside covers of Amy Winehouse's \"Tears Dry on Their Own\" and Etta James's \"I'd Rather Go Blind,\" aimed at showcasing her vocal range during the single's chart run. On February 14, 2018, she appeared on BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge, delivering an acoustic rendition of \"New Rules\" paired with a cover of Arctic Monkeys' \"Do I Wanna Know?,\" enhancing the track's momentum after its November 2017 release. \n\nFor the Future Nostalgia era, Lipa performed on Saturday Night Live on December 19, 2020, presenting \"Levitating\" and \"Don't Start Now\" amid pandemic restrictions, with the latter incorporating virtual backup dancers to promote the album's dance-pop themes. She followed with a BBC Radio 1 Live Lounge session on May 26, 2021, featuring \"Love Again\" and a cover of Outkast's \"Hey Ya!,\" timed to sustain interest post-release.\n\nPromoting Radical Optimism, Lipa released an acoustic version of \"Training Season\" on March 22, 2024, emphasizing introspective lyrics in a minimal arrangement. She staged a free concert in New York City's Times Square on May 5, 2024, performing album cuts like \"Houdini\" to an estimated crowd of thousands, capitalizing on the lead single's visibility. On May 4, 2024, as host and musical guest on Saturday Night Live, she debuted \"Illusion\" and \"Happy for You,\" integrating choreography reflective of the album's optimistic vibe.  Her BBC Radio 1 Live Lounge appearance on May 7, 2024, included \"Illusion,\" \"Training Season,\" and \"Happy for You,\" with a cover of Brandy's \"The Boy Is Mine\" to tie into contemporary trends. Culminating the cycle, Lipa filmed An Evening with Dua Lipa at London's Royal Albert Hall on October 17, 2024—a orchestral-backed special airing on ITV December 8 and CBS December 15—reinterpreting hits like \"One Kiss\" and new material to underscore the album's live adaptability.",
