  "content": "# Shark\n\nSharks are a monophyletic group of cartilaginous fishes in the superorder Selachimorpha, characterized by skeletons composed of cartilage rather than bone, skin covered in dermal denticles, five to seven gill slits, and the absence of a swim bladder. They encompass over 500 extant species distributed among approximately 30 families, inhabiting predominantly marine environments from shallow coastal waters to abyssal depths, though a minority, such as the bull shark, tolerate freshwater incursions.\n\nEvolving from primitive chondrichthyan ancestors, the earliest shark-like scales date to around 450 million years ago in the Late Ordovician, with definitive shark fossils emerging by the Devonian period approximately 400 million years ago, predating trees and bony fishes in the vertebrate fossil record. This longevity reflects adaptations like ampullae of Lorenzini for electroreception, superior olfactory capabilities, and continuously replacing teeth suited for predation, enabling sharks to thrive as key regulators in oceanic food webs despite episodic mass extinctions.\n\nDiverse in form—from the filter-feeding whale shark, the largest fish at up to 12 meters, to the compact spiny dogfish—sharks demonstrate varied reproductive strategies including oviparity, viviparity, and ovoviviparity, alongside migratory behaviors and schooling in some species. While revered for their prowess, human-shark interactions remain rare, with unprovoked attacks numbering fewer than 100 annually worldwide, far overshadowed by sharks' vulnerability to overfishing and habitat loss.\n\n## Etymology\n\n### Origins of the Term\n\nThe English term \"shark,\" denoting a large predatory fish, first appears in written records on July 11, 1442, in the Latin journal of Thomas Bekynton, Bishop of Bath and Wells, who used \"le sharke\" to refer to a fish observed during a voyage from England to Bordeaux. This isolated early attestation, preserved in Bekynton's official correspondence, indicates the word circulated in maritime or Anglo-Latin contexts among English speakers by the mid-15th century, though it did not enter general printed usage until later. By the 1560s, \"shark\" gained wider currency in English, coinciding with increased European exploration and encounters with tropical shark species; a notable example is a 1569 London broadside titled *The True Discription of this Marueilous Straunge Fishe*, advertising a captured shark for public viewing.\n\nThe precise etymology of \"shark\" remains uncertain, likely originating as specialized sailor jargon from an unidentified language, given the multinational crews on 15th- and 16th-century ships. One prominent hypothesis traces it to the Yucatec Maya word *xoc* (pronounced roughly as \"shock\"), denoting sharks or similar toothy sea creatures, potentially transmitted to English via Caribbean voyages such as John Hawkins' 1568–1569 expedition near the Yucatán Peninsula, where crews bartered and clashed with Maya groups. Linguistic evidence for *xoc* includes Maya phrases like *xoc yee halal* (arrows tipped with shark teeth) and *uayab xoc* (were-shark sorcerers), supporting its specificity to the animal; however, the absence of intermediate forms in Spanish (*tiburón*, from Tupi *uperu*) or other European tongues weakens direct causation, as Northern Europeans had limited pre-voyage familiarity with large sharks.\n\nCompeting theories favor European roots, positing \"shark\" as a semantic extension from Germanic terms evoking predation or villainy, such as a variant of Middle High German *schürgen* (\"to poke\" or \"stir\"), which evolved into *Schurke* (\"scoundrel\") by the late 16th century and was applied to the fish's cunning hunting style around 1599. Earlier English descriptors for shark-like fish, such as \"hound-fish\" from the early 14th century, reflect a tradition of naming based on superficial resemblances rather than precise taxonomy, with Germanic parallels like Old Norse *har* (whence Norwegian *hai* and German *Hai*) sharing an obscure but independent origin. No single theory resolves the ambiguity, as the term's rapid adoption aligns with empirical encounters during the Age of Sail, prioritizing descriptive utility over etymological purity.\n\n## Evolutionary History\n\n### Fossil Record\n\nSharks possess a sparse fossil record due to their cartilaginous skeletons, which rarely mineralize, leaving primarily isolated teeth, dermal denticles, scales, and fin spines as evidence of past diversity. Whole-body fossils are exceptional, often preserved in lagerstätten like the Mazon Creek or Bear Gulch formations.\n\nThe earliest traces attributable to shark-like chondrichthyans are isolated scales from the Late Ordovician period, approximately 450 million years ago, though these may represent stem-group relatives rather than crown sharks. Undisputed shark scales appear in the early Silurian, over 420 million years ago, indicating the group's ancient origins predating bony fishes. By the Devonian period (419–359 million years ago), shark teeth and more complete fossils emerge, such as those of *Doliodus* and *Cladoselache*, showcasing primitive jawed vertebrates with heterocercal tails and multiple gill slits. This era marks a radiation of elasmobranchs amid the \"Age of Fishes.\"\n\nCarboniferous and Permian deposits (359–252 million years ago) yield abundant teeth from hybodontiform sharks, bridging Paleozoic and Mesozoic forms, while rare articulated specimens reveal early reproductive and ecological adaptations. Mesozoic records (252–66 million years ago) document neoselachian diversification, including modern lineages like galeomorphs, with fossils from Jurassic and Cretaceous lagerstätten showing specialized dentitions for durophagy and piscivory. Cenozoic fossils (66 million years ago to present) feature iconic giants like *Megalodon* (*Otodus megalodon*), whose teeth indicate body lengths up to 18 meters and extinction around 3.6 million years ago linked to cooling oceans and prey decline.\n\nRecent discoveries include a 436-million-year-old *Fangjinshania* specimen from China, pushing back articulated shark records, and a 340-million-year-old new species from Mammoth Cave, highlighting ongoing revelations in Paleozoic diversity.  Despite gaps, the record underscores sharks' resilience through five mass extinctions, with over 500 extinct genera contrasting roughly 500 extant species.\n\n### Taxonomy and Phylogeny\n\nSharks comprise the superorder Selachimorpha (or division Selachii) within the subclass Elasmobranchii of class Chondrichthyes, the cartilaginous fishes that also include rays, skates (together forming the batoids or Batoidea), and chimaeras (Holocephali). Chondrichthyes diverged from bony fishes (Osteichthyes) around 420 million years ago in the Silurian-Devonian periods, with sharks representing the dominant predatory lineage among elasmobranchs due to their active swimming adaptations and skeletal efficiency.\n\nPhylogenetic analyses, integrating morphological and molecular data such as ribosomal RNA sequences, position modern sharks as monophyletic and sister to batoids within Elasmobranchii, with Holocephali as the outgroup to elasmobranchs. Within Selachimorpha, sharks divide into two primary clades—Squalimorphii (squalomorphs, including basal forms with multiple gill slits and primitive traits) and Galeomorphii (galeomorphs, featuring advanced jaw and fin structures)—a topology upheld by species-level molecular phylogenies that reject earlier \"hypnosqualean\" groupings linking angel sharks closely to sawsharks. This bifurcation reflects evolutionary divergences: squalomorphs retaining plesiomorphic features like amphistylic jaw suspension, while galeomorphs exhibit innovations such as hyostylic suspension for enhanced gape and mobility.\n\nSqualimorphii encompasses six orders: Hexanchiformes (e.g., frilled and cow sharks, with 6-7 gill slits), Squaliformes (spiny dogfishes), Squatiniformes (angel sharks), Pristiophoriformes (sawsharks), and others like Echinorhiniformes, totaling around 100 species with deep-water affinities and ovoviviparous reproduction. Galeomorphii includes four orders: Heterodontiformes (bullhead sharks, the most basal galeomorphs with grinding dentition), Orectolobiformes (carpet sharks, including whale and nurse sharks), Lamniformes (mackerel sharks, such as great whites with regional endothermy), and Carcharhiniformes (ground sharks, the largest order with over 280 species like requiem and catsharks, dominant in coastal ecosystems). Approximately 550 shark species are currently recognized across 55 families, though molecular studies continue to refine boundaries, revealing cryptic diversity and occasional polyphyly in traditional groupings like triakid houndsharks. These classifications prioritize cladistic principles, emphasizing shared derived traits (synapomorphies) such as clasper morphology in males and vertebral calcification patterns over superficial resemblances.\n\n## Anatomy\n\n### Skeleton\n\nThe skeleton of sharks is composed entirely of cartilage, a flexible and lightweight connective tissue that contrasts with the bony endoskeletons of most other fish, enabling greater flexibility for agile swimming while reducing overall body density to assist buoyancy. This cartilaginous structure typically includes 200 to 400 individual elements, often reinforced through calcification or mineralization in load-bearing areas like the vertebrae, which prevents buckling under muscular forces without adding excessive weight. The absence of true bone—except in specialized cases such as tooth roots—distinguishes sharks as chondrichthyans, with cartilage providing durability comparable to bone but with superior elasticity for torsion and bending during rapid maneuvers.\n\nThe chondrocranium forms the primary skull component, a rigid yet lightweight enclosure for the brain, olfactory capsules, orbits, and otic capsules, featuring processes like the rostrum and antorbital extensions that anchor sensory structures and musculature. Jaws represent a specialized skeletal adaptation: the upper jaw (palatoquadrate cartilage) suspends independently from the cranium via ligaments, allowing protrusion and expansion for capturing prey, while the lower jaw (Meckel's cartilage) articulates flexibly to accommodate powerful bites exceeding 4,000 pounds per square inch in species like the great white shark. The vertebral column, comprising a series of cartilaginous centra and arches, extends from the skull to the tail, functioning as a flexible spring-like axis that stores and releases energy during propulsion, with calcification in the neural and hemal arches enhancing compressive strength.\n\nBranchial elements, including the hyoid arch and successive gill arches, support the gills and pharyngeal region, forming a basket-like framework derived from serial cartilages that facilitate water flow and jaw mechanics. Appendicular skeleton components consist of cartilaginous radials and basals radiating from pectoral and pelvic girdles, which are unattached to the vertebral column in primitive forms, providing pivotal support for fins used in steering and stability rather than rigid propulsion. In some species, such as the goblin shark, prismatic calcifications further stiffen the cranium for deep-sea pressures, illustrating evolutionary variations in skeletal mineralization. Sharks lack ribs, relying instead on surrounding musculature and skin for organ protection, which underscores the skeleton's streamlined design optimized for hydrodynamic efficiency over comprehensive enclosure.\n\n### Teeth and Jaw\n\nShark jaws consist of cartilaginous structures, with the upper jaw (palatoquadrate) suspended below the cranium via ligaments, muscles, and connective tissue rather than being directly fused to the skull, enabling protrusion and a wide gape during feeding. The lower jaw (Meckel's cartilage) articulates with the upper jaw at the mandibular symphysis and corners, supported by the hyomandibula in a hyostylic suspension that facilitates jaw retraction and protraction. This arrangement, distinct from the fixed jaws of bony fishes, allows for mechanical advantage in capturing elusive prey.\n\nShark teeth are embedded in a flexible tooth bed membrane rather than fixed sockets, arranged in multiple rows forming functional series that advance forward in a conveyor-belt mechanism. Teeth continuously replace lost or damaged ones, with regeneration occurring throughout life; for instance, in white sharks, replacement intervals average 106 days in the upper jaw and 114 days in the lower for juveniles, though anterior teeth in some species may renew within days. A single shark can produce tens of thousands of teeth over its lifetime due to this polyphyodont dentition.\n\nTooth morphology varies by species and diet: serrated, triangular blades in species like tiger and great white sharks slice through flesh and bone, while needle-like cusps in mako sharks grip fast-swimming fish, and flattened, pavement-like teeth in nurse or angel sharks crush mollusks and crustaceans.  These adaptations correlate with trophic ecology, with cutting dentition suited for vertebrate predators and grinding forms for benthic invertebrates.\n\nBite forces reflect jaw leverage and muscle power, with great white sharks exerting up to 18,000 Newtons (approximately 4,000 pounds-force), among the highest recorded for cartilaginous fishes, while shortfin mako sharks reach 13,000 Newtons; these values enable penetration of tough hides and bone.  Despite robust mechanics, frequent tooth shedding necessitates ongoing replacement to maintain predatory efficiency.\n\n### Fins and Tail\n\nSharks possess unpaired and paired fins supported by cartilaginous fin rays, which enable flexible movement for propulsion, stability, steering, and lift during swimming. Most species feature two dorsal fins, a pair of pectoral fins, a pair of pelvic fins, an anal fin, and a caudal fin, though some lack the anal or second dorsal fin. These fins interact with water flow to generate hydrodynamic forces, with pectoral fins functioning akin to wings for lift to counteract sinking, while dorsal fins prevent lateral rolling.\n\nThe first dorsal fin, located midway along the back, provides primary stabilization against yaw and roll, with its size and position varying by species to suit cruising or ambush predation styles. A smaller second dorsal fin, if present, offers supplementary stability near the tail. Paired pectoral fins, attached behind the gill slits, generate lift and enable sharp turns or braking by adjusting angle relative to the body axis. Pelvic fins, positioned ventrally behind the pectorals, contribute to roll stability and yaw control; in males, they are modified into rigid claspers for internal fertilization. The anal fin, absent in some species like the great white shark, aids ventral stability similar to the second dorsal fin.\n\nThe caudal fin, or tail, serves as the main propulsive structure, generating forward thrust through lateral oscillations powered by axial muscles. Shark caudal fins are typically heterocercal, with the dorsal lobe larger than the ventral due to vertebral column extension into the upper lobe, producing both thrust and upward lift to compensate for the shark's negative buoyancy. Some advanced species exhibit homocercal tails with more symmetrical lobes for efficient cruising at higher speeds. The upper lobe generates the majority of thrust, with caudal keels in fast-swimming species like makos enhancing streamlining and power output. Tail shape correlates with lifestyle: lunate tails in oceanic sharks optimize sustained speed, while asymmetrical tails in benthic species facilitate maneuvering over substrates.\n\n### Dermal Denticles\n\nDermal denticles, also termed placoid scales, are tooth-like structures embedded in the dermis of sharks, covering much of their body surface except for areas like the mouth interior. These denticles consist of an outer layer of enameloid, a middle layer of dentine, and an inner pulp cavity supplied with blood vessels and nerves, mirroring the composition of shark teeth. Unlike cycloid or ctenoid scales in bony fishes, denticles are placoid and project outward, providing a rough texture to the skin.\n\nThe primary functions of dermal denticles include hydrodynamic efficiency and physical protection. In terms of hydrodynamics, their V-shaped, ridged surfaces channel water flow to reduce turbulence and drag during swimming, with studies showing that specific denticle sizes and arrangements can enhance thrust and self-propelled speed in certain species. For protection, denticles act as armor against predators, ectoparasites, and abrasion from rough surfaces or during mating behaviors, where skin damage is common; their density and shape contribute to resilience, particularly in demersal species near rocky habitats. Additional roles may encompass antifouling by deterring organism attachment and, in some cases, luminescence for camouflage.\n\nVariations in dermal denticle morphology occur both across shark species and along the body, adapting to ecological niches and behaviors. Fast-swimming pelagic sharks often feature streamlined denticles for drag reduction, while slower or bottom-dwelling species may have more robust forms for abrasion resistance; for instance, denticle density is lower in species like bull sharks compared to others, and size influences swimming performance, with smaller denticles boosting speed in experimental models. Ontogenetic changes during growth alter denticle properties, affecting maturity-related functions such as high-speed swimming or mating protection. These differences also serve as taxonomic indicators, with fossil denticles revealing shifts in prehistoric shark communities toward pelagic forms.\n\n## Physiology\n\n### Buoyancy and Respiration\n\nSharks maintain neutral buoyancy without a gas-filled swim bladder through a disproportionately large liver, which can comprise up to 25% of their total body weight and contains low-density oils such as squalene. The squalene, a hydrocarbon with density lower than seawater, provides uplift, while its near-equal compressibility to water ensures stability during vertical movements and pressure changes. Deep-sea species accumulate particularly high concentrations of squalene and diacyl glyceryl ethers in the liver to achieve buoyancy at extreme depths.\n\nSharks respire by extracting dissolved oxygen from water passed over their gills, which are supported by 5 to 7 external gill slits per side. Water enters primarily through the mouth or, in species with spiracles (modified first gill slits behind the eyes), via these openings, then flows unidirectionally over the gill filaments for gas exchange before exiting the slits.\n\nRespiration occurs via ram ventilation, where swimming generates water flow over the gills, or buccal pumping, where pharyngeal muscles actively draw in and expel water. Pelagic species like the great white shark (*Carcharodon carcharias*) rely on obligate ram ventilation, necessitating constant motion to avoid suffocation, whereas many demersal sharks switch to buccal pumping when stationary, aided by spiracles to prevent sediment intake. This dual capability in facultative ventilators enhances energy efficiency across habitats.\n\n### Thermoregulation and Osmoregulation\n\nElasmobranchs, including sharks, maintain osmotic balance with seawater primarily through high concentrations of urea and trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) in their plasma, resulting in body fluids that are iso-osmotic or slightly hyperosmotic to the external medium. Seawater typically exhibits an osmolarity of about 1000 mOsm/L, while shark plasma ranges from 1000 to 1100 mOsm/L, dominated by organic osmolytes rather than inorganic ions. This approach reduces passive water influx across permeable gill epithelia and minimizes the need for extensive ion excretion compared to hypoosmotic marine teleosts. Urea levels in plasma commonly reach 300–500 mmol/L, with TMAO at 70–100 mmol/L, the latter serving to stabilize proteins against urea's denaturing effects by forming hydrogen-bond networks that exclude urea from protein surfaces.\n\nIn euryhaline species such as bull sharks (Carcharhinus leucas), plasma osmolarity adjusts with salinity—1067 mOsm/L in seawater versus 642 mOsm/L in freshwater—via regulated urea synthesis and retention, though marine forms predominate in most taxa. The rectal gland secretes excess sodium chloride to fine-tune ionic balance, preventing overload from diffusive influx. TMAO also contributes to hydrostatic pressure resistance in deep-sea elasmobranchs, where levels increase relative to urea.\n\nMost sharks are ectothermic, with core body temperatures equilibrating with ambient water, limiting sustained activity in cold environments. However, lamniform sharks such as shortfin makos (Isurus oxyrinchus), great whites (Carcharodon carcharias), and salmon sharks (Lamna ditropis) possess regional endothermy, elevating temperatures in red muscle, cranial organs, and viscera by 7–21°C above ambient via retia mirabilia—networks of arteriovenous countercurrent exchangers that conserve metabolic heat from oxidative muscle contraction. This mesothermic adaptation supports higher contraction rates, faster pursuits, and broader thermal niches, as evidenced by makos' rapid warming kinetics exceeding cooling by an order of magnitude. Centralized red muscle in species like the smalltooth sand tiger (Odontaspis ferox) further facilitates heat retention. Some non-lamniforms, including scalloped hammerheads (Sphyrna lewini), employ behavioral thermoregulation by closing gill slits during deep dives to minimize convective heat loss.\n\n### Digestion\n\nSharks ingest prey whole or in large chunks via the mouth and pharynx, with initial mechanical processing aided by teeth and jaw musculature, before transport through a short, muscular esophagus to the stomach. The stomach, typically J-shaped in most species, secretes concentrated hydrochloric acid—reaching pH levels as low as 0.4 in nurse sharks (*Ginglymostoma cirratum*) shortly after feeding—and pepsinogen, which activates to pepsin for proteolytic breakdown of proteins into peptides. Gastric contractions mechanically triturate food, while the low pH denatures proteins and kills pathogens, enabling storage of undigested material for days to weeks in species adapted to sporadic feeding.\n\nChyme exits the stomach via the pyloric sphincter into the duodenum, where secretions from the pancreas— including trypsin, chymotrypsin, amylase, and lipase—and bile from the liver emulsify and hydrolyze fats, carbohydrates, and remaining proteins. The spiral valve intestine, unique to elasmobranchs, features a coiled mucosal fold that expands surface area for nutrient absorption up to several times that of a straight tube of equivalent length, while slowing digesta transit to enhance contact time with absorptive villi. This structure promotes unidirectional flow akin to a valveless pump, relying on gravity and peristalsis to direct material downward without backflow, as demonstrated in 3D reconstructions of species like the spiny dogfish (*Squalus acanthias*).\n\nEnzyme profiles vary by diet and physiology; for example, bonnethead sharks (*Sphyrna tiburo*) exhibit cellulase activity in the colon, likely from symbiotic microbes, facilitating breakdown of seagrass despite a primarily carnivorous diet. Pelagic endothermic species like the shortfin mako (*Isurus oxyrinchus*) show elevated protease and lipase levels compared to ectotherms, correlating with higher metabolic demands. Absorption primarily occurs in the spiral intestine's anterior regions for amino acids, sugars, and lipids, with water and electrolytes reclaimed terminally; undigested residues form feces expelled through the rectum and cloaca. This system supports efficient energy extraction from high-protein diets, minimizing feeding frequency in oligotrophic environments.\n\n### Bioluminescence and Fluorescence\n\nCertain species of deep-sea sharks exhibit bioluminescence, the enzymatic production of light via photophores containing luciferin and luciferase, distinct from fluorescence which involves light absorption and re-emission. Bioluminescence occurs exclusively in the order Squaliformes, particularly within the family Etmopteridae (lanternsharks) and the dalatiid kitefin shark *Dalatias licha*. These photophores are densely distributed on the ventral surfaces, flanks, and sometimes dorsal areas, enabling controlled light emission.\n\nThe biochemical mechanism in these sharks relies on hormonal regulation, unique among vertebrates, involving melatonin for activation, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) for enhancement, and α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH) for inhibition, allowing precise temporal control of glow intensity and duration. For instance, in velvet belly lanternshark *Etmopterus spinax*, light emission persists for hours post-stimulation, facilitated by photophores that match the spectral quality of ambient downwelling light around 470-480 nm. The kitefin shark, reaching lengths of 1.8 meters, represents the largest known bioluminescent vertebrate, with its luminescence confirmed through in situ observations off New Zealand in 2020-2021, displaying uniform dermal photophores covering up to 10% of body surface area.\n\nPrimary evidence supports counter-illumination as the adaptive function, where ventral light emission mimics oceanic background illumination to reduce silhouette visibility against predators viewing from below, as demonstrated by the matching photon flux and angular distribution in *E. spinax*. Embryonic development of photophores in lanternsharks precedes pigmentation, suggesting camouflage prioritization from hatching at depths of 200-500 meters. Alternative roles include aposematic signaling or intraspecific communication, though empirical support remains limited compared to camouflage models derived from optical modeling and behavioral assays. Phylogenetic reconstructions indicate bioluminescence evolved convergently in squalomorph lineages adapting to mesopelagic zones, with fossil evidence of photophore-like structures in Jurassic dalatiids.\n\nIn contrast, biofluorescence has been documented in shallower-water species, notably catsharks (*Scyliorhinidae*) and swellsharks (*Cephaloscyllium*), where dermal pigments absorb blue wavelengths (around 450 nm) prevalent in marine environments and re-emit green light (510-530 nm). This was first observed in 2014 during dives off California, revealing intense fluorescence in species like the swellshark *C. ventrimaculatum* and chain catshark *S. reticulatus*, with patterns intensifying in low-light conditions to enhance contrast. Chemical analysis in 2019 identified bromo-tryptophan metabolites as the fluorophores, a novel class absent in non-fluorescent congeners, concentrated in skin layers via multi-scale microscopy.\n\nSharks possess visual pigments sensitive to green fluorescence, enabling detection, with sexually dimorphic patterns—brighter in males—suggesting roles in mate recognition or conspecific signaling within turbid or crepuscular habitats. However, ecological function remains speculative, as controlled experiments show no clear predation deterrence, and fluorescence intensity varies ontogenetically without direct fitness correlations established. Unlike bioluminescence, fluorescence requires external excitation and thus serves passive optical modulation rather than active emission.\n\n## Sensory Systems\n\n### Olfaction\n\nSharks possess a highly developed olfactory system adapted for detecting chemical cues in aquatic environments, with paired nares on the snout serving as inlets for odor-laden water. These nares connect to olfactory sacs containing folds of tissue known as lamellae, which are lined with sensory epithelium embedded with chemoreceptors capable of binding to specific odor molecules such as amino acids from prey tissues. Unlike mammalian nostrils, shark nares are not linked to the respiratory system or mouth, preventing water entry into the oral cavity during olfaction.\n\nOdor detection occurs passively as sharks swim forward, drawing water into the incurrent nares, across the lamellae for molecular interaction, and out through excurrent openings, without active sniffing. This mechanism enables continuous sampling of the surrounding water for scents signaling food, mates, or predators. Empirical measurements show sharks can detect blood at concentrations of one part per million, equivalent analogously to sensing one inch of blood diluted in 16 miles of water, though actual effective range in ocean currents is far shorter due to rapid dilution and dispersion.\n\nQuantitative analyses across 21 shark and ray species reveal elaborate olfactory rosettes with varying numbers of lamellae, yet a relatively small repertoire of olfactory receptor genes compared to bony fishes, suggesting efficiency through organ size and structure rather than genetic diversity. Sensitivity appears uniform across species, independent of snout shape, size, or olfactory complexity, as demonstrated in behavioral assays.\n\nIn behavior, olfaction guides prey localization and orientation via bilateral differences in odor arrival times and intensities, allowing sharks to steer toward sources even in the absence of visual or hydrodynamic cues. This sensory input integrates with other modalities, such as the lateral line, to refine source tracking in turbulent flows.\n\n### Vision\n\nShark eyes share structural similarities with those of other vertebrates, featuring a cornea, iris, lens, and retina adapted for underwater vision. The laterally positioned eyes provide a wide field of view, often exceeding 300 degrees horizontally, with limited binocular overlap primarily in forward and upward directions to detect prey above. \n\nThe retina is dominated by rod photoreceptors, which confer high sensitivity to low light levels prevalent in marine habitats, supplemented by a tapetum lucidum—a layer of guanine crystals behind the retina that reflects unabsorbed light back through the photoreceptors, enhancing photon capture efficiency.  This adaptation enables sharks to detect light at intensities approximately 10 times lower than humans can in comparable conditions.\n\nMost shark species possess monochromatic vision, with only one type of cone photoreceptor, rendering them incapable of distinguishing colors and instead relying on luminance contrast and motion for target detection.  Visual acuity, measured by the ability to resolve spatial details, is generally lower than in humans, particularly for fine patterns at close range, but optimized for identifying silhouettes and movement at distances relevant to hunting in turbid or dim waters. \n\nPupils typically exhibit a vertical slit shape, allowing precise control over light entry to prevent overload in brighter shallows while maximizing intake in depths. A nictitating membrane, a translucent third eyelid, protects the eye during prey capture without obstructing vision. Species-specific variations exist, such as enlarged eyes in deep-water sharks for enhanced light gathering or the widely spaced cephalofoil in hammerheads, which expands the binocular field for improved prey localization. \n\n### Hearing and Electroreception\n\nSharks lack external ears and detect sound primarily through inner ear structures that respond to particle motion and acceleration rather than sound pressure. These inner ears include otolithic organs such as the utricle, saccule, and lagena, where hair cells transduce vibrations into neural signals. The auditory system enables sharks to perceive low-frequency sounds associated with prey activity, such as struggling or distress signals.\n\nShark hearing sensitivity peaks in the range of 20 to 300 Hz, with detection capabilities extending from approximately 10 Hz to 800 Hz across species, though upper limits vary; for instance, some sharks show thresholds improving at frequencies up to 200 Hz. Low-frequency irregular sounds below 40 Hz particularly attract sharks, mimicking those produced by wounded prey over distances exceeding 1 km in some cases. Sound localization occurs via interaural time and intensity differences, aided by the separation of inner ears.\n\nElectroreception in sharks is mediated by the ampullae of Lorenzini, specialized sensory organs consisting of clusters of electroreceptive cells connected by jelly-filled canals to pores distributed across the head, particularly the snout. These ampullae detect weak bioelectric fields generated by prey muscle contractions, heartbeats, and gill movements, functioning as tonic receptors sensitive to direct current and low-frequency alternating fields. Sensitivity reaches thresholds as low as 1 nanovolt per centimeter, allowing sharks to locate hidden or buried prey in low-visibility conditions where other senses are limited. This electrosensory capability, evolutionarily conserved in chondrichthyans, also aids in navigation and social interactions by responding to geomagnetic fields and conspecific bioelectricity.\n\n### Lateral Line System\n\nThe lateral line system in sharks comprises a series of fluid-filled subdermal canals extending along the flanks of the body and branching across the head, interconnected by pores that open to the external environment. These canals house clusters of sensory neuromasts, which serve as mechanoreceptors tuned to detect hydrodynamic disturbances such as water displacement, pressure gradients, and low-frequency vibrations. In elasmobranchs like sharks, the system features both canal neuromasts—embedded within the canal walls for protection and enhanced sensitivity to steady flows—and superficial neuromasts (also termed pit organs), positioned in shallow skin grooves or between modified scales to respond to near-field accelerations. \n\nEach neuromast contains sensory hair cells bearing a kinocilium and multiple stereocilia embedded in a gelatinous cupula; deflection of the cupula by water motion shears the stereocilia, triggering bidirectional depolarization or hyperpolarization in the hair cells, which in turn generates action potentials in afferent nerves proportional to the stimulus velocity and direction. This mechanotransduction process allows sharks to resolve water movements over distances up to several body lengths, with sensitivity to flows as weak as those produced by conspecifics or prey at low velocities. Unlike the electrosensory ampullae of Lorenzini, which detect bioelectric fields, the lateral line exclusively processes mechanical stimuli, though the two systems often integrate for comprehensive environmental monitoring.\n\nIn predation, the lateral line enables sharks to detect and orient toward the wake turbulence generated by evasive maneuvers of prey, facilitating strikes on hidden or low-visibility targets in turbid conditions.  Experimental ablation studies confirm its necessity for accurate prey tracking, as sharks with impaired lateral line function exhibit reduced localization precision during hunts. For navigation and obstacle avoidance, the system supports rheotaxis—alignment with prevailing currents—and detection of stationary objects via self-generated flow fields during swimming, aiding spatial mapping in reefs or open water.  Morphological variations, such as denser canal branching on the head, correlate with species-specific behaviors like benthic foraging in bottom-dwelling sharks.\n\n## Life Cycle\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSharks reproduce exclusively through internal fertilization, in which males transfer sperm to females using paired appendages known as claspers, which are extensions of the pelvic fins. During mating, the male typically bites the female to hold her in position and inserts one clasper into her cloaca, a process that can last several minutes to hours depending on the species; this behavior often results in visible scars on females from the bites. Mating occurs seasonally or opportunistically, influenced by factors such as water temperature and prey availability, with females storing sperm for delayed fertilization in some species.\n\nSharks exhibit three primary reproductive strategies: oviparity, ovoviviparity, and viviparity, with ovoviviparity being the most prevalent among the approximately 500 known species. In oviparity, females deposit leathery egg cases—often called mermaid's purses—onto substrates like seaweed or rocks, where embryos develop using yolk reserves for periods ranging from 6 to 9 months before hatching independently; this mode occurs in about 40% of species, including catsharks (Scyliorhinidae) and Port Jackson sharks. Ovoviviparous species retain eggs within the uterus until embryos hatch internally, after which pups are born live and nourished initially by unfertilized eggs or uterine secretions; gestation lasts 9 to 24 months, as seen in spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias). Viviparous sharks, such as hammerheads and requiem sharks, provide additional nourishment via a yolk-sac placenta or histotroph (uterine milk), enabling larger pups at birth but with smaller litter sizes.\n\nCertain species employ extreme adaptations, including intrauterine cannibalism, where the largest embryo consumes siblings or undeveloped eggs to accelerate growth. In sand tiger sharks (Carcharias taurus), each uterus typically produces only one surviving pup per pregnancy despite multiple initial embryos, a phenomenon termed adelphophagy that ensures the offspring's size advantage upon birth after gestations of 9 to 12 months. Similar oophagy—consumption of eggs—occurs in species like the grey nurse shark, reducing litter sizes to as few as two while maximizing the survivors' viability in nutrient-poor environments. Post-birth, shark pups receive no parental care and must fend for themselves immediately, relying on fully formed structures like teeth and fins. These strategies reflect evolutionary trade-offs between offspring quantity and quality, with slower maturation rates contributing to sharks' vulnerability to overfishing.\n\n### Embryonic Development and Brooding\n\nShark embryonic development varies across reproductive modes, including oviparity, ovoviviparity, and viviparity, with brooding typically involving internal retention of eggs or embryos in the latter two. In oviparous species, such as catsharks (*Scyliorhinus* spp.) and bamboo sharks (*Chiloscyllium* spp.), females deposit eggs encased in tough, leathery capsules known as mermaid's purses, which feature tendrils for anchoring to substrates and apertures for gas exchange. The embryo inside relies on a yolk sac for nourishment, undergoing organogenesis over periods ranging from 90 to 120 days in warmer waters, as documented in the brownbanded bamboo shark (*Chiloscyllium punctatum*), where full development takes approximately 118 days at controlled temperatures. These capsules balance impermeability against predators with selective permeability for oxygen and waste diffusion, enabling the embryo to hatch as a fully formed miniature adult capable of immediate predation.\n\nOvoviviparous sharks, comprising the majority of species, retain fertilized eggs within the oviduct, where embryos develop using yolk reserves until hatching internally, after which pups are birthed live. Development proceeds similarly to oviparity initially, with embryos absorbing yolk via the yolk-sac placenta, but without external cases; gestation durations span 6 to 24 months depending on species and environmental factors. In species like the sand tiger shark (*Carcharias taurus*), early embryos exhibit oophagy, consuming unfertilized eggs or siblings (adelphophagy) to supplement yolk, reducing brood size to typically two large pups per uterus that emerge at lengths of 1 meter or more.\n\nViviparous sharks, such as great whites (*Carcharodon carcharias*), nourish embryos via uterine secretions (histotrophy) or limited placental transfer, fostering extended gestation—up to 18 months in some cases—without yolk consumption post-initial stages. Brooding in these modes provides protection from external threats, with the mother's body regulating conditions, though it imposes metabolic costs; pups are born fully independent, with brood sizes averaging 2 to 12. Across all modes, embryonic stages feature rapid skeletal calcification, fin development, and sensory organ maturation, ensuring post-hatching survival in predatory environments.\n\n### Growth and Longevity\n\nSharks exhibit indeterminate growth, continuing to increase in size throughout their lives, albeit at decelerating rates as they age. This pattern involves the annual deposition of growth bands in their cartilaginous vertebrae, analogous to tree rings, which serve as the primary basis for age estimation in most species.  Growth rates vary significantly by species, habitat, and environmental factors; smaller, faster-metabolizing species like some requiem sharks achieve rapid juvenile growth to support high energy demands, while larger species prioritize slower, sustained expansion of skeletal cartilage. \n\nLongevity in sharks spans a broad range, with most species living 20 to 30 years in the wild, though some attain exceptional ages due to low metabolic rates and cold-water adaptations. For instance, great white sharks (*Carcharodon carcharias*) typically reach 40 to 70 years, with the oldest verified individual at 73 years, determined via vertebral ring counts.  Hammerhead and tiger sharks similarly fall in the 20- to 70-year bracket, reflecting their K-selected life history strategies emphasizing few offspring and prolonged parental investment. At the extreme, Greenland sharks (*Somniosus microcephalus*) represent the longest-lived vertebrates, with radiocarbon dating of eye lens proteins yielding estimates of at least 250 years and up to 392 ± 120 years for mature individuals; this method leverages the immutable core proteins formed at birth, unaffected by later metabolic turnover.  \n\nThese traits—slow growth and extended lifespans—confer resilience to sporadic predation but heighten vulnerability to human-induced pressures like overfishing, as populations recover sluggishly; for example, many species require 10 to 30 years to reach sexual maturity, delaying recruitment. Genomic studies on long-lived species like the Greenland shark suggest adaptations such as expanded genomes and efficient DNA repair may underlie their durability, though causal mechanisms remain under investigation. Empirical data from tag-recapture and banding validate these patterns, underscoring the need for species-specific chronologies to refine age validations beyond traditional vertebral methods.\n\n## Behavior\n\n### Locomotion and Speed\n\nSharks propel themselves primarily through lateral oscillations of the caudal fin, which generates thrust via reactive forces from water displacement. The heterocercal structure of the tail, featuring an enlarged dorsal lobe, produces both forward propulsion and upward lift to offset the shark's inherent negative buoyancy due to the absence of a swim bladder.  Most species utilize carangiform or thunniform swimming modes, where undulations are restricted to the posterior body and tail to minimize drag, facilitated by a rigid body reinforced by vertebral column and skin denticles that reduce turbulence.  Pectoral fins contribute to steering, stability, and minor lift generation during steady swimming, while some benthic species, such as angelsharks, employ enlarged pectorals for ambulatory \"walking\" or punting along substrates.\n\nSwimming efficiency relies on red muscle fibers concentrated near the body axis for sustained propulsion, enabling high performance without excessive energy expenditure. Sharks maintain vertical position through continuous motion, as hydrodynamic lift from fins and body plan compensates for density greater than seawater, supplemented by low-density squalene oils in the liver. Tail kinematics adjust with speed: at higher velocities, sharks reduce body angle and increase tail beat frequency and amplitude for enhanced thrust.\n\nBurst speeds vary by species and context, often during predation or evasion. The shortfin mako (*Isurus oxyrinchus*) attains the highest recorded speeds, up to 74 km/h (46 mph) in short bursts and sustained rates around 50 km/h (31 mph), aided by a stiff, crescent-shaped caudal fin and warm-blooded musculature.  The great white shark (*Carcharodon carcharias*) reaches 56 km/h (35 mph) during attacks. Thresher sharks (*Alopias* spp.) achieve cruising speeds of 48 km/h (30 mph), with tail whips exceeding 129 km/h (80 mph) for prey stunning. Slower species, like nurse sharks, manage only 5 km/h (3 mph) due to ambush-oriented lifestyles. Caudal fin closure during acceleration enhances straight-line performance by optimizing thrust vectoring.\n\n### Intelligence and Learning\n\nSharks exhibit cognitive abilities through associative learning, memory retention, and problem-solving, as demonstrated in controlled experiments, though their encephalization quotients—ratios of brain mass to expected mass for body size—are generally lower than those of mammals, averaging around 1:2496 across species.  Relative brain size varies phylogenetically and ecologically among chondrichthyans, with some species like manta rays showing enlarged telencephalons associated with social complexity, but sharks prioritize sensory regions like the olfactory bulbs over neocortex-like structures found in higher vertebrates.  These traits enable adaptive behaviors rather than abstract reasoning, aligning with their predatory ecology where rapid sensory integration and learned avoidance of threats confer survival advantages.\n\nExperimental evidence confirms sharks' capacity for classical and operant conditioning; for instance, small-spotted catsharks (*Scyliorhinus canicula*) learned to associate a light stimulus with food rewards via classical conditioning, displaying conditioned responses after repeated trials. Juvenile Port Jackson sharks (*Heterodontus portusjacksoni*) navigated a T-maze to access food, mastering the task in 5–21 sessions and retaining spatial memory without reinforcement for up to six weeks, indicating long-term retention capabilities. Grey bamboo sharks (*Chiloscyllium punctatum*) demonstrated numerical discrimination, distinguishing between groups of 3 versus 6 two-dimensional objects with above-chance accuracy, suggesting basic quantitative processing.\n\nSocial learning further underscores shark intelligence; juvenile lemon sharks (*Negaprion brevirostris*) acquired foraging techniques faster when observing trained conspecifics than when learning individually, with paired learners solving novel tasks in fewer trials. Habituation studies show adaptive plasticity, as captive juvenile sharks reduced investigatory responses to an unrewarded squid odor after 21 days of exposure, conserving energy by avoiding false foraging cues. These findings, drawn from lab and field observations, reveal sharks rely on socially transmitted information and individual experience to solve ecological problems, challenging prior underestimations of their cognition based solely on brain-body metrics. \n\n### Social Interactions and Sleep\n\nMost shark species are solitary predators that forage independently, with limited evidence of persistent social bonds in adults; however, juveniles of certain species, such as lemon sharks (*Negaprion brevirostris*), demonstrate social learning by observing and mimicking the foraging techniques of conspecifics in experimental settings. Aggregations occur across taxa for purposes including feeding, reproduction, and predator avoidance, often driven by environmental cues like prey availability rather than deliberate sociality; for instance, scalloped hammerheads (*Sphyrna lewini*) form large schools that enhance hunting efficiency through coordinated movements.  In reef-associated species like grey reef sharks (*Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos*), leader-follower dynamics emerge during patrols, where larger females or males initiate movements that smaller individuals follow, suggesting emergent hierarchies based on size and sex. White sharks (*Carcharodon carcharias*), by contrast, show primarily spatial overlap without strong social interactions, reinforcing that pelagic species tend toward asociality.\n\nSharks do not sleep in the mammalian sense, lacking rapid eye movement or deep unconscious states, but exhibit rest periods characterized by reduced metabolic rates, muscle relaxation, and behavioral quiescence to conserve energy between foraging bouts. In bottom-dwelling species like draughtsboard sharks (*Cephaloscyllium isabellum*), sleep involves a flattened body posture on the substrate with eyes remaining open, correlating with the lowest oxygen consumption rates observed—up to 70% below active levels—indicating physiological rest akin to sleep in other vertebrates.  Actively swimming sharks, such as those requiring constant motion for gill ventilation, likely employ unihemispheric rest, where one brain hemisphere remains alert while the other reduces activity, though direct electrophysiological confirmation remains limited to stationary species. These patterns, conserved over 450 million years of evolution, prioritize energy efficiency in ectothermic predators facing irregular food availability, without evidence of dream states or cognitive processing during rest.\n\n## Ecology\n\n### Habitat and Distribution\n\nSharks occupy diverse aquatic habitats spanning marine, estuarine, and freshwater environments across all major ocean basins, from polar to tropical regions. Over 500 described species exploit coastal shelves, coral reefs, mangroves, and open pelagic waters, with adaptations enabling tolerance of varying salinities, temperatures, and depths. Many coastal and reef-associated species, such as blacktip reef sharks, prefer shallow, warm waters near shorelines for foraging and nursery grounds, while pelagic species like blue sharks roam vast expanses of the open ocean. Demersal species inhabit continental slopes and ocean floors, but sharks are absent from true abyssal zones below approximately 4,000 meters due to physiological constraints on buoyancy, oxygen use, and energy demands in extreme low-pressure, low-food environments.\n\nMore than half of shark species dwell in deep-sea habitats below the photic zone (typically 200–1,000 meters or deeper), where cold temperatures and darkness prevail, including species like goblin sharks and sixgill sharks that scavenge or hunt in near-total obscurity. A smaller subset, including the bull shark and Ganges shark, ventures into freshwater rivers and lakes, such as the Amazon and Mississippi basins, facilitated by osmoregulatory adaptations allowing survival in low-salinity conditions for extended periods—bull sharks, for instance, have been documented traveling over 4,000 kilometers up the Amazon River. Estuarine habitats serve as transitional zones for many species, supporting juveniles that migrate between fresh and salt water.\n\nGlobally, shark distributions are uneven, with highest species richness in the Indo-Pacific region, where over 400 species occur, compared to fewer than 100 in the Atlantic; the Pacific hosts sites with more than 15 co-occurring species in some areas. Latitudinal gradients show concentrations in tropical and subtropical waters, though some, like the porbeagle, extend into subpolar seas. Distributions are fragmented around seamounts, ocean ridges, and continental margins, comprising roughly 30% of total ocean volume, influenced by prey availability, temperature (optimal 10–25°C for most), and salinity gradients. Climate-driven shifts, such as warming-induced poleward migrations, are altering ranges, with models projecting habitat contractions in equatorial zones for species like whale sharks.\n\n### Feeding Strategies\n\nSharks exhibit a range of feeding strategies tailored to their ecological niches, from active predation to filter feeding, reflecting adaptations in jaw structure, dentition, and sensory capabilities. Most species are carnivorous predators that employ ambush or pursuit tactics to capture prey, utilizing serrated teeth for gripping and tearing flesh, as seen in tiger sharks (*Galeocerdo cuvier*), which rely on stealth and sudden bursts of speed for ambushing larger vertebrates. Great white sharks (*Carcharodon carcharias*) typically ambush seals from below near colonies, delivering powerful bites that cause massive tissue loss, often leading to prey death, with occasional paired hunting observed through biologging data showing coordinated social dynamics during attacks. \n\nAmbush predation is prominent in benthic species like angel sharks (*Squatina* spp.), which lie camouflaged on the ocean floor, emerging rapidly to engulf passing fish and invertebrates with upward strikes. Sevengill sharks (*Notorynchus cepedianus*) demonstrate versatile tactics, including pinning larger prey against the substrate before consumption, contributing to their success as apical predators in coastal ecosystems. In contrast, pelagic hunters such as thresher sharks (*Alopias* spp.) employ unique tail-whipping techniques to herd and stun schools of small fish, as documented in observational studies. Grey reef sharks (*Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos*) exhibit natural predatory behaviors including rapid strikes on reef-associated prey, captured via underwater footage in coral environments.\n\nFilter-feeding strategies dominate in planktivorous species like whale sharks (*Rhincodon typus*), which actively swim with mouths agape, filtering plankton, sergestid shrimp, calanoid copepods, chaetognaths, and small fish using specialized gill rakers and pharyngeal pads; individuals average 7.5 hours per day in surface feeding bouts. These sharks alternate between suction feeding—drawing water into the mouth while stationary—and lunge feeding when prey is concentrated by other predators, processing water through 20 filtering pads before expulsion via gill slits.  Basking sharks (*Cetorhinus maximus*) similarly ram-filter feed by forward propulsion with wide-open mouths, targeting zooplankton in short trophic chains.\n\nMany sharks, including tiger and sevengill species, function as opportunistic generalists, exploiting variable prey availability through optimal foraging, which allows dietary flexibility across persistent food sources like fish, cephalopods, and carrion.  These behaviors underscore sharks' evolutionary success as predators, with strategies evolving convergently across lineages to maximize energy intake relative to hunting costs.\n\n### Role in Ecosystems\n\nSharks function primarily as predators within marine food webs, exerting top-down control that regulates prey populations and maintains trophic balance. As apex or mesopredators depending on species and habitat, they suppress mid-level consumers such as rays, smaller fish, and cephalopods, preventing these from overexploiting lower trophic levels like shellfish and seagrasses. For instance, in the Northwest Atlantic, depletion of large predatory sharks has correlated with a proliferation of cownose rays (*Rhinoptera bonasaurus*), which in turn consumed bay scallops (*Argopecten irradians*) at rates exceeding sustainable levels, contributing to the collapse of scallop fisheries by the early 2000s. Similar patterns emerge in reef systems, where shark removal alters prey behavior and abundance, reducing overall biodiversity and resilience.\n\nBeyond predation, sharks facilitate nutrient cycling through migration and excretion, redistributing organic matter across ocean depths and habitats. Species like tiger sharks (*Galeocerdo cuvier*) and reef sharks transport nitrogen and phosphorus from offshore or deep waters to coastal reefs via fecal and urinary release, subsidizing primary productivity in nutrient-poor areas; studies at Palmyra Atoll indicate sharks supply up to 65% of new nitrogen to certain reef ecosystems. Deep-water sharks contribute to carbon sequestration by scavenging organic detritus on the seafloor, effectively removing it from the atmospheric cycle. These roles enhance ecosystem stability, with evidence from overfished regions showing diminished nutrient flux and algal overgrowth following shark declines.\n\nIn broader terms, sharks' presence correlates with higher functional diversity in coastal and pelagic systems, buffering against perturbations like climate variability. Large-bodied species, such as great whites (*Carcharodon carcharias*), exert disproportionate influence due to their wide-ranging predation, with global populations of such sharks having declined by approximately 71% over the past five decades, amplifying risks of cascading effects like mesopredator booms and habitat degradation. While not all shark species dominate as apex predators—many operate as mesopredators alongside teleost fishes—their combined impacts underscore their integral position in sustaining marine ecosystem services, including fisheries support and carbon regulation.\n\n## Interactions with Humans\n\n### Shark Attacks\n\nShark attacks on humans remain exceedingly rare relative to human coastal activities and shark populations, with global unprovoked bites averaging approximately 70 per year and 5-6 fatalities annually over recent decades. In 2024, the International Shark Attack File (ISAF) recorded 47 unprovoked attacks worldwide, a 32% decline from 69 in 2023 and the lowest total in 28 years, alongside only 4 fatalities. This contrasts sharply with human impacts on sharks, as tens of millions are killed yearly through fishing.\n\nUnprovoked attacks, comprising the majority documented by ISAF, occur when sharks bite without direct human provocation, often due to mistaken identity where humans are confused for natural prey such as seals or fish, driven by factors like silhouette, splashing, or low visibility conditions. Provoked incidents, by contrast, involve human actions like handling or feeding sharks, spearfishing, or entering chummed waters, which elicit defensive or investigatory responses. Attacks peak during dawn and dusk when sharks are most active, and environmental shifts including prey scarcity or habitat overlap exacerbate encounters.\n\nThree species account for the bulk of unprovoked attacks: the great white (*Carcharodon carcharias*), tiger (*Galeocerdo cuvier*), and bull (*Carcharhinus leucas*) sharks, with the latter deemed most dangerous due to its aggression, tolerance for low-salinity waters enabling riverine incursions, and propensity for multiple bites.  Great whites feature in over 350 confirmed attacks historically, often exploratory \"test bites\" leading to release upon non-prey recognition, while bull sharks' unpredictability in turbid, nearshore habitats heightens risk.\n\nGeographically, the United States reports the highest incidence, with Florida alone averaging 20-30 bites yearly, followed by Australia and South Africa where surf conditions and marine mammal concentrations align with shark ranges. Fatalities, though low, spiked to 10 in 2023 before dropping, underscoring that while attacks provoke media attention, empirical odds place shark bites far below risks like drowning or lightning strikes. ISAF data, derived from verified reports since 1580, reveals no upward trend in attacks per capita despite rising ocean recreation, attributing variations to reporting biases and localized factors rather than inherent shark aggression toward humans.\n\n### Fisheries and Economic Use\n\nSharks are harvested globally through directed fisheries and as bycatch in other operations, with reported landings to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) peaking at 868,000 metric tons in 2000 before declining, though underreporting suggests actual catches remain substantial. Estimates indicate total annual fishing mortality affects around 80 million individual sharks, equivalent to roughly 1.2 million metric tons if averaging 15 kg per shark, driven by demand for high-value parts.\n\nThe primary economic products derive from shark fins, meat, and secondary by-products. Fins, comprising less than 5% of body mass, command premium prices for use in shark fin soup, a traditional delicacy in Chinese cuisine, with the global fin trade valued at approximately $400–550 million annually based on earlier assessments, though recent bans and shifting consumer preferences have reduced volumes. Shark meat, often processed into fillets or used in pet food, constitutes the bulk of landings by weight and is exported widely, with the United States alone shipping 6.5 million pounds valued at $12.3 million in 2023, primarily to Europe and Asia. Liver oil, rich in squalene, supports pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries, while skin yields leather and cartilage is marketed for joint supplements, contributing to a total shark product market nearing $1 billion.\n\nDirected fisheries target pelagic species such as blue sharks (*Prionace glauca*), shortfin makos (*Isurus oxyrinchus*), and porbeagles (*Lamna nasus*), alongside demersal species like spiny dogfish (*Squalus acanthias*), with over 150 shark species recorded in catches across Asia, Europe, and Latin America. Indonesia and India lead in volume, often supplying fins to Hong Kong and mainland China, while European nations like Spain and Portugal process meat for local consumption and export, reflecting regional specialization in the supply chain. These activities provide livelihoods for coastal communities but rely on practices like finning, where carcasses are discarded at sea to maximize cargo space for high-value fins.\n\n### Captivity and Research\n\nMaintaining sharks in captivity poses significant challenges due to their physiological and behavioral adaptations to open ocean environments, including requirements for constant swimming to facilitate ram ventilation, vast territories for migration, and specific dietary needs that are difficult to replicate in enclosed systems. Larger predatory species, such as great white sharks (*Carcharodon carcharias*), have historically failed to thrive, with attempts since 1955 involving nearly 30 individuals resulting in death or release within days or weeks due to stress, trauma, insufficient space, and disrupted natural behaviors. The Monterey Bay Aquarium achieved the longest recorded displays of great white sharks, including a juvenile held for 198 days between 2004 and 2009 and an adult male for approximately six months in 2016, but all were ultimately released as they exhibited signs of distress, such as refusal to feed or self-inflicted injuries from tank walls.\n\nSmaller, more sedentary species fare better in aquariums, with successes reported for nurse sharks (*Ginglymostoma cirratum*), bamboo sharks (*Chiloscyllium spp.*), epaulette sharks (*Hemiscyllium ocellatum*), and spiny dogfish (*Squalus acanthias*), which tolerate static conditions, lower activity levels, and captive breeding. Improvements in husbandry techniques, such as optimized water filtration, enriched environments, and species-specific feeding protocols, have enabled longer-term maintenance and even reproduction for certain elasmobranchs, though overall captive lifespans remain shorter than in the wild, often by years. Aquariums prioritize hardier species compatible with mixed exhibits to balance educational display with animal welfare, avoiding high-mortality risks associated with pelagic sharks.\n\nShark research relies on non-invasive field methods to overcome captivity limitations, including acoustic and satellite tagging to track migration patterns, habitat use, and population dynamics, as employed by NOAA Fisheries and the Florida Museum of Natural History's acoustic telemetry systems. Additional techniques encompass underwater videography for behavioral observation, aerial and drone surveys for surface sightings, and genetic sampling for aging and biodiversity assessments, with facilities like the Bimini Biological Field Station focusing on ecosystem roles through laboratory analysis of field-collected data. The Atlantic Shark Institute integrates artificial intelligence to process video footage for species identification and abundance estimation, while the Canadian Pacific Shark Research Lab develops bomb dating for precise aging of species like basking sharks (*Cetorhinus maximus*). Citizen science initiatives, such as those coordinated by the New England Aquarium, supplement professional efforts by crowdsourcing sighting reports to monitor bycatch mortality and habitat shifts. These approaches prioritize empirical data from natural settings to inform conservation, revealing causal factors like overfishing impacts without relying on potentially biased captive proxies.\n\n### Cultural Depictions\n\nIn many Polynesian and Hawaiian traditions, sharks, known as *manō*, are depicted as sacred *aumakua*—ancestral guardian spirits that protect families, guide lost canoes to safety, and drive fish into nets for fishermen. Hawaiian mythology includes nine named shark deities, such as Kamohoali'i, a shark god associated with navigation and sorcery who could shapeshift between shark and human forms. Similarly, Māori culture in New Zealand views sharks (*māmāo*) as symbols of strength and protection, with ancestral spirits sometimes manifesting as sharks to aid kin. These portrayals emphasize reverence and familial bonds rather than predation, reflecting empirical observations of sharks' behaviors in coastal ecosystems where they coexisted with humans without widespread hostility.\n\nIn contrast, ancient Western depictions often cast sharks or shark-like creatures as embodiments of insatiable hunger and peril. Greek lore features *Ketea*, a ravenous sea monster resembling a shark, and the shark-like goddess Lamia, who devoured children out of vengeance. Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder described sharks in *Naturalis Historia* (circa 77 CE) as aggressive maritime threats capable of pursuing ships. By the 19th century, American artist Winslow Homer's painting *The Gulf Stream* (1899) illustrated a marooned sailor menaced by circling sharks, symbolizing existential dread and the raw causality of ocean survival. Such representations drew from documented maritime encounters, including shipwreck accounts, but amplified anthropomorphic fears over ecological context.\n\nThe 1975 film *Jaws*, directed by Steven Spielberg and adapted from Peter Benchley's novel, profoundly shaped modern Western cultural views by portraying a rogue great white shark as a relentless, intelligent killer targeting beachgoers off Amity Island. Released on June 20, 1975, it grossed over $470 million worldwide and instilled widespread phobia, prompting shark hunts—such as Queensland's 1962–1971 culling program escalation—and tourism declines in coastal areas. Spielberg later expressed regret for fueling real-world shark killings, noting the film's mechanical shark malfunctions inadvertently heightened suspense but distorted public understanding of sharks' opportunistic feeding. Subsequent shark-themed films, like *Deep Blue Sea* (1999) and *The Reef* (2010), perpetuated tropes of hyper-aggressive, superintelligent sharks escaping captivity or hunting humans en masse, reinforcing a narrative of sharks as existential threats despite statistical rarity of attacks (fewer than 10 fatal unprovoked incidents annually globally). This cinematic legacy, amplified by media sensationalism, contrasts sharply with indigenous respect, prioritizing dramatic causality over empirical data on shark-human interactions.\n\n## Myths and Misconceptions\n\n### Common Fallacies\n\nOne prevalent fallacy portrays sharks as indiscriminate predators actively seeking human prey, often depicted as \"mindless killing machines\" in popular media. In reality, unprovoked shark bites worldwide average 60-80 per year, with fewer than 10 fatalities annually, making them far rarer than risks like drowning or vehicle accidents; for context, lightning strikes kill about 20 times more people globally each year. This misconception stems from sensationalized portrayals, but empirical data from the International Shark Attack File indicates humans are not part of sharks' natural diet, with most bites resulting from mistaken identity—such as surfers resembling seals from below—or investigative bites rather than predatory intent.\n\nAnother common error assumes all shark species pose significant threats to humans due to their size or teeth, ignoring the diversity among over 500 extant species. While large species like great whites or tigers account for most incidents, the majority—such as nurse sharks, catsharks, or the plankton-feeding whale shark—rarely exceed 1 meter in length and exhibit docile behaviors, with no recorded human fatalities from many harmless varieties. Fossil records and ichthyological surveys confirm this variation, as smaller sharks comprise about 90% of species and primarily consume fish, invertebrates, or plankton rather than pursuing large mammals.\n\nThe notion that sharks can detect a single drop of blood from miles away exaggerates their olfactory acuity, which, while acute, operates at concentrations of about 1 part per million within an effective range of roughly 400 meters in currents, not transoceanic distances. Laboratory tests and field observations, including tracer dye experiments, demonstrate dilution and environmental factors limit detection far below popularized claims, which lack empirical support and trace back to unsubstantiated anecdotes rather than controlled studies.\n\nA further fallacy claims shark populations are exploding, leading to surging attacks, but global bite statistics have remained stable or shown minor upticks attributable to increased human coastal activity and reporting, not population booms; for instance, 2022 recorded 57 unprovoked bites worldwide, consistent with historical averages adjusted for population growth. Overfishing has depleted many shark stocks by 70-90% since the 1970s, per FAO assessments, underscoring that perceived threats often reflect human expansion into marine habitats rather than inherent aggression.\n\n### Debunking with Evidence\n\nSharks do not actively hunt humans as prey, contrary to depictions in media; the vast majority of unprovoked bites result from mistaken identity, where surfers or swimmers are confused with seals or fish due to silhouette or splashing. The International Shark Attack File documented 47 unprovoked bites globally in 2024, with only 4 fatalities, rates far lower than risks like drowning or lightning strikes despite billions of human ocean entries annually.\n\nThe assertion that sharks are impervious to cancer, which spurred ineffective cartilage-based therapies, lacks empirical support; tumors, including melanomas and chondrosarcomas, have been observed in at least 23 shark species, with great white sharks exhibiting metastatic cancers in wild specimens examined via necropsy. Shark cartilage supplements failed clinical trials, showing no anti-tumor efficacy in humans.\n\nSharks' olfactory acuity allows detection of blood at one part per million dilution—comparable to sensing a teaspoon in an Olympic pool—but the popularized claim of identifying a single drop from a mile distant overstates capabilities, as diffusion, currents, and concentration gradients limit reliable detection to roughly a quarter-mile under optimal conditions, without guaranteeing aggression.\n\nNot all sharks suffocate if stationary; while species like great whites rely on ram ventilation, requiring forward motion to force water over gills, approximately 95% utilize buccal pumping to actively draw oxygenated water through their mouths and pharynx, enabling rest on seabeds as observed in nurse and epaulette sharks.\n\nPerceptions of escalating shark aggression driving attack surges are unfounded; unprovoked incidents have held steady or risen modestly in correlation with expanded human coastal development and water sports participation since the 1950s, not behavioral shifts in sharks, as tracked by long-term databases.\n\n## Threats and Conservation\n\n### Primary Threats\n\nOverfishing represents the predominant threat to shark populations worldwide, with an estimated 80 million sharks killed annually by fishing activities as of 2019, marking a 4% increase from 76 million in 2012 despite international finning bans and management efforts. This mortality encompasses both targeted fisheries and bycatch, where non-target sharks are incidentally captured in nets or on longlines, often discarded dead or dying; coastal fisheries have seen the sharpest rises, while pelagic operations showed minor declines in some regions like the Atlantic and Western Pacific. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) assesses that overfishing drives the extinction risk for one-third of all shark, ray, and chimaera species, with 37% classified as threatened globally in a 2024 report, exacerbated by sharks' slow reproductive rates—many mature late, produce few offspring, and exhibit low population resilience. Nations such as Indonesia, India, and Spain account for the largest shark catches, fueling demand for meat, fins, and other products.\n\nShark finning, a subset of overfishing, amplifies this pressure by targeting fins for soups and traditional medicines while discarding carcasses at sea, contributing to the deaths of up to 73 million sharks yearly. Although bans exist in many countries and via international agreements like those from the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), enforcement gaps persist, with global fin trade volumes sustaining high mortality; for instance, studies estimate 71% declines in oceanic shark and ray populations since the 1970s directly linked to this practice. Retention bans on fins have shown limited efficacy without complementary measures like quotas and monitoring, as illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing circumvents regulations, particularly in developing nations with weak oversight.\n\nHabitat degradation compounds overfishing by disrupting shark nurseries and foraging grounds, with coastal development destroying mangroves and seagrasses essential for juvenile survival—trawling and dredging alone have reduced mangrove coverage by up to 35% in some regions since 1980, limiting escape routes and prey availability for species like blacktip reef sharks. Coral reef-associated sharks face acute risks, with 59% of 134 species threatened due to bleaching, dynamite fishing, and pollution, which degrade reef structures providing shelter; for example, warming oceans and intensified storms from climate change have shifted prey distributions, forcing migratory sharks into riskier, fished areas. These losses interact causally with fishing pressures, as habitat fragmentation increases vulnerability to capture, though empirical data indicate overexploitation remains the proximal driver of population crashes across taxa.\n\n### Conservation Measures\n\nInternational conservation efforts for sharks include listings under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), which regulates trade in over 50 shark and ray species as of 2023 to curb overexploitation. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) maintains Red List assessments indicating that 37% of assessed sharks and rays face extinction risk, guiding targeted protections through criteria emphasizing biological vulnerability and fishery impacts. Regional fisheries management organizations, such as the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC), adopted the first international shark finning ban in 2005, prohibiting the removal of fins at sea and requiring whole sharks to be landed.\n\nNational and regional regulations focus on finning prohibitions and fishery quotas. In the United States, the Shark Finning Prohibition Act of 2000 mandates that sharks be landed with fins naturally attached, with enforcement data from 2023 showing compliance through inspections and reporting under the Magnuson-Stevens Act. The European Union banned finning in 2003 via Regulation (EC) No 1185/2003, later strengthening it in 2012 to eliminate loopholes, though trade persists via imports. Canada prohibited finning in 1994 and extended bans to imports and exports in 2019, aiming to reduce domestic demand. Despite these measures, global shark fishing mortality rose from an estimated 76 million individuals in 2012 to 80 million in 2019, as finning bans incentivize retaining whole carcasses for meat markets, potentially exacerbating pressure on populations.\n\nMarine protected areas (MPAs) serve as no-take zones for localized shark populations, particularly reef species. Large MPAs, such as the 54,000 km² Palmyra Atoll National Wildlife Refuge, have demonstrated substantial protection for grey reef sharks by limiting fishing access, with abundance data showing higher densities inside versus outside boundaries. The Bahamas Shark Sanctuary, established in 2011 covering 640,000 km², correlates with stable or increasing local shark sightings, suggesting effectiveness when paired with enforcement. However, efficacy diminishes for wide-ranging pelagic sharks, as less than 8% of tracked individuals' ranges overlap with MPAs, necessitating complementary national fisheries management to double conservation benefits.\n\nAdditional measures include Important Shark and Ray Areas (ISRAs), identified by IUCN since 2022 to prioritize habitat protection based on species ecology and vulnerability, though implementation lags with only partial coverage of threatened ranges. Science-based quotas and bycatch reduction technologies, enforced in regions like the U.S. Atlantic, have prevented collapses in managed stocks, reducing extinction risk for species under strict limits. Overall, while these interventions mitigate localized declines, global overfishing persists without universal enforcement and demand reduction.\n\n### Controversies and Debates\n\nOne major controversy in shark conservation surrounds the use of lethal control programs, such as drumlines and nets, to mitigate human-shark interactions near beaches. Proponents argue these measures protect public safety by targeting large predatory species like tiger and great white sharks; for instance, Queensland's Shark Control Program, operational since the 1960s, has been credited with reducing fatal attacks in monitored areas, though correlation with low baseline incidence rates complicates causation. Critics, including the IUCN, contend that such programs are largely ineffective at preventing bites due to sharks' mobility and the rarity of attacks—global unprovoked incidents number around 70-80 annually—while causing significant bycatch of non-target marine life, including turtles and dolphins, with efficacy debates persisting owing to insufficient long-term data. \n\nShark finning bans represent another flashpoint, balancing conservation goals against economic realities in fishing communities. Advocates for bans, such as those enacted in several U.S. states and proposed federally via the Shark Fin Sales Elimination Act, emphasize reducing demand that drives the estimated 73 million sharks killed annually for fins, primarily through finning at sea to maximize cargo space. Opponents, including U.S. fisheries officials, highlight that domestic shark fisheries are well-managed with quotas, and bans would disproportionately harm American fishermen by devaluing high-profit fins relative to meat, yielding minimal global impact since the U.S. represents only about 1% of the trade's sustainable segment, potentially undermining managed stocks without curbing unregulated foreign finning. \n\nDebates also extend to the evidence base of popular conservation narratives, where empirical scrutiny reveals mismatches between advocacy and data; for example, focusing on fin trade prohibitions overlooks that many shark populations targeted by such campaigns are not in acute decline, and misinformed messaging—often amplified by social media influencers promoting non-scientific interactions like shark touching or chumming—can erode trust in genuine efforts by prioritizing spectacle over addressing primary drivers like bycatch in non-shark fisheries.  Non-lethal alternatives, such as electronic deterrents (e.g., Freedom+ Surf, which reduced bait-taking by sharks in tests by up to 60%) and drone surveillance, show promise for localized risk reduction but face skepticism over scalability and cost-effectiveness compared to traditional methods.",
