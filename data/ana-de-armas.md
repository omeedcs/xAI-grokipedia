## Early life

### Upbringing in post-Soviet Cuba

Ana de Armas was born on April 30, 1988, in Havana, Cuba, and primarily raised in the coastal town of Santa Cruz del Norte, approximately 20 miles east of the capital. Her father, Ramón de Armas, worked as a teacher and later school principal, while her mother was employed in human resources; the family, including her older brother Javier, lived in modest circumstances typical of many Cuban households during the era. Maternal grandparents, who were Spanish immigrants to Cuba, influenced the family's cultural ties, though de Armas spent portions of her early years residing with her grandparents in Havana while her parents and brother remained in Santa Cruz.

Her childhood unfolded amid Cuba's "Special Period in Time of Peace," the acute economic downturn triggered by the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991, which severed annual subsidies worth roughly $4-6 billion that had sustained the island's command economy since the 1960s. This phase, extending through the 1990s and into the early 2000s, imposed severe hardships including chronic food rationing via the libreta system (limiting citizens to basics like 3 pounds of rice and 1.5 pounds of beans monthly per person), widespread blackouts lasting up to 12-16 hours daily in some areas, fuel scarcity, and a national GDP plunge of over 35% between 1989 and 1993, exacerbating malnutrition and prompting desperate measures like the ox-cart revival and urban bicycle proliferation. De Armas' family navigated these realities with resilience, as instilled by her parents, though resources were scarce enough that she frequently wore her brother's hand-me-down clothing.

Despite the privations, de Armas later reflected on aspects of freedom in her environment, recounting extensive time spent playing on beaches, in nature, and on streets with local children, unencumbered by modern distractions. Electricity rationing and the absence of household appliances like DVD players restricted access to international films and television, with no internet available until much later, yet these limitations inadvertently fueled her early fascination with performance through sporadic local viewings and innate creativity. The era's isolation from global media, compounded by state-controlled information flows, contrasted sharply with the cultural vibrancy of Cuban music and theater that surrounded her, shaping a determination evident in her decision to pursue acting formally by age 12.

### Education and relocation to Spain

De Armas commenced her acting education at age 14 in 2002, enrolling in the National Theatre School of Havana, Cuba's premier institution for dramatic arts. She completed a four-year program there, focusing on foundational techniques in performance, voice, and movement, which prepared her for early roles in Cuban-Spanish co-productions. This training occurred amid Cuba's constrained film industry, limited to roughly a dozen features annually, prompting her to seek expanded prospects abroad.

In 2006, at age 18, de Armas relocated from Havana to Madrid, Spain, leveraging her maternal grandparents' Spanish heritage to obtain citizenship and a passport. She departed with minimal resources—reportedly around 200 euros—and initially stayed with family, driven by the scarcity of professional acting opportunities in post-Soviet Cuba, where state-controlled media prioritized ideological content over commercial projects. Upon arrival, she bypassed further formal schooling in favor of immediate auditions, securing her breakthrough in Spanish television shortly thereafter. This move marked a pivotal shift, exposing her to Spain's more dynamic entertainment sector, though it required rapid adaptation to a competitive market dominated by established Iberian talent.

## Career

### Beginnings in Spanish media (2006–2013)

Ana de Armas moved to Madrid, Spain, in 2006 at age 18 to advance her acting career after initial experience in Cuban productions. She secured her breakthrough role as Carolina Leal Solís, a central character in the teen mystery drama series *El Internado*, which premiered on Antena 3 in 2007 and ran for seven seasons until 2010. The series, produced by Globomedia, followed students uncovering dark secrets at a remote boarding school and drew significant viewership among Spanish youth, establishing de Armas as a recognizable face in national television.

Concurrent with *El Internado*, de Armas appeared in the 2009 coming-of-age film *Mentiras y gordas*, directed by Alfonso Albacete and David Menkes, portraying a young woman entangled in a web of friendships, romances, and deceptions during a summer holiday. The ensemble cast included emerging Spanish actors like Mario Casas and Yon González, and the film explored themes of adolescent rebellion and excess, grossing modestly at the box office. Following the conclusion of *El Internado*, she took on supporting roles in historical television, including Nerea in *Hispania, la leyenda*, a 2010–2012 Antena 3 series depicting Roman conquests in ancient Iberia.

De Armas continued building her Spanish film résumé with smaller parts, such as in the 2011 thriller *El callejón* (Blind Alley), where she played a minor role amid a story of isolation and psychological tension. In 2012, she featured as Sabina in *Perrito chino*, a low-budget drama, further diversifying her portfolio before transitioning toward international opportunities by 2013. These early Spanish projects honed her skills in both television and cinema, relying on her natural charisma and limited experience to gain steady work in a competitive market.

### Hollywood transition and supporting roles (2014–2019)

In 2014, Ana de Armas relocated from Spain to Los Angeles to advance her acting career in Hollywood, arriving with minimal proficiency in English. She undertook intensive language immersion, learning lines phonetically for early auditions and roles to compensate for her linguistic limitations. This determination enabled her to secure her first English-language film appearance despite initial barriers.

De Armas debuted in Hollywood with the 2015 psychological thriller *Knock Knock*, directed by Eli Roth, where she portrayed Bel, one of two seductive young women who ensnare architect Evan Webber (Keanu Reeves) in a deadly game. The film, released on October 9, 2015, by Lionsgate Premiere, received mixed critical reception for its plot but highlighted de Armas's screen presence in a supporting antagonistic role. She followed with *Exposed* (2016), another thriller co-starring Keanu Reeves, playing Isabel, a woman connected to a supernatural element amid a detective's investigation; the film had a limited U.S. release on January 22, 2016.

In 2016, de Armas appeared in two supporting roles emphasizing romantic interests. In *War Dogs*, directed by Todd Phillips and released on August 12, 2016, she played Iz, the girlfriend of arms dealer David Packouz (Miles Teller), navigating the protagonists' illicit dealings; de Armas memorized her dialogue phonetically due to ongoing language challenges. Later that year, in the biographical sports drama *Hands of Stone* (June 24, 2016 release), she portrayed Felicidad Iglesias, wife of boxer Roberto Durán (Édgar Ramírez), providing emotional depth to the narrative of Durán's career.

De Armas's performance in *Blade Runner 2049* (2017), directed by Denis Villeneuve and released on October 6, 2017, marked a pivotal supporting role as Joi, a customizable holographic AI companion to blade runner K (Ryan Gosling). Joi's character explores themes of artificial intimacy and identity in the dystopian sequel to the 1982 original, with de Armas's portrayal contributing to the film's critical acclaim for visual and emotional layers, though the role's digital rendering required extensive motion-capture work. This appearance elevated her visibility, leading to further opportunities while she continued in smaller supporting capacities through 2019, including the action film *Overdrive* (2017, U.S. release 2018) as garage-owner Stephanie.

### Leading roles and commercial success (2020–2025)

In 2020, de Armas took the leading role of Sofia Hoffman, a lawyer entangled in a criminal conspiracy, in the thriller *The Informer*, directed by James Kent and released on November 6. The film earned a modest worldwide gross of $3.4 million, reflecting limited commercial appeal amid competition from streaming releases during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Her performance as the CIA agent Paloma in the James Bond film *No Time to Die* (2021), released on October 8, marked a significant commercial breakthrough, with the movie grossing $758.9 million worldwide despite pandemic-related delays. While Paloma was a supporting role, de Armas's action sequences and screen presence contributed to the film's status as the highest-grossing entry in the franchise at the time, outperforming expectations in international markets.)#tab=summary)

De Armas assumed a leading role in the erotic thriller *Deep Water* (2022), portraying Melinda Van Allen opposite Ben Affleck, in a Hulu and Amazon Prime Video release on January 14 that prioritized streaming over theaters. The film received mixed reviews and lacked substantial box office data due to its platform distribution, underscoring the challenges of direct-to-streaming models for theatrical visibility. Later that year, she starred as CIA operative Dani Miranda in Netflix's *The Gray Man* (July 15), which grossed only $451,000 in limited theatrical runs before shifting to streaming, underperforming relative to its high-profile cast and $200 million budget.

In *Blonde* (2022), de Armas led as Norma Jeane Mortenson/Marilyn Monroe in Andrew Dominik's Netflix biographical drama, released on September 16 following a limited theatrical run that grossed approximately $5.3 million. The film drew controversy for its explicit content and stylistic choices, earning a 43% critics' score on Rotten Tomatoes, though de Armas's transformative portrayal garnered individual praise amid debates over historical accuracy.

De Armas co-led as CIA agent Sadie in the action comedy *Ghosted* (2023), opposite Chris Evans, which debuted on Apple TV+ on April 21 and set a platform record with 328,500 viewers in its first two days. Despite a 25% Rotten Tomatoes score reflecting critical pans for formulaic plotting, the film's streaming metrics indicated strong initial audience engagement, later resurfacing on charts in 2025.

Transitioning to action leads, de Armas starred as the assassin Eve Macarro in *From the World of John Wick: Ballerina* (2025), released on June 6 with an opening weekend of $24.5 million domestically. The film grossed $131.8 million worldwide against a $90 million budget, achieving moderate profitability but falling short of franchise expectations due to title confusion and market saturation, though it succeeded in premium video-on-demand sales.#tab=summary)

Her role as Baroness Eloise in the survival thriller *Eden* (2025), released August 22, represented a commercial disappointment, grossing just $2.5 million worldwide despite co-starring Sydney Sweeney. The film's underperformance highlighted risks in mid-budget genre fare, with limited marketing and audience turnout contributing to its box office shortfall.) Overall, de Armas's period blended high-profile franchise involvement with streaming ventures, yielding uneven commercial results dominated by *No Time to Die*'s outlier success amid a shift toward non-theatrical distribution.

## Personal life

### Romantic relationships

Ana de Armas married Spanish actor Marc Clotet in July 2011 after dating since 2010; the private ceremony took place on the Costa Brava. The couple divorced amicably in early 2013, with both parties later describing the split as mutual and maintaining a friendly relationship thereafter.

De Armas dated talent agent Franklin Latt from 2015 to 2016, a relationship she referenced briefly in a 2016 *Vanity Fair* interview as having ended prior to her rising Hollywood profile.

Her most publicized romance was with actor Ben Affleck, beginning in late 2019 on the set of *Deep Water*. The pair quarantined together in Los Angeles during the early COVID-19 pandemic, with de Armas meeting Affleck's children, but ended the relationship in January 2021 due to incompatible long-term goals and intense media scrutiny.

In September 2021, de Armas began dating Tinder vice president Paul Boukadakis, whom she met through mutual friends during the pandemic. They appeared together at events including the 2022 Venice Film Festival but separated quietly in early 2024.

De Armas was linked to Manuel Anido Cuesta, stepson of Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel, in November 2024 after photographs showed them kissing during a date in Madrid. The brief relationship concluded in 2025 amid her focus on professional commitments.

### Family aspirations and motherhood

De Armas has publicly expressed a strong desire to start a family and become a mother, stating in a July 2025 interview with Italian magazine *F* that she would like to have children "soon if possible." At age 37, she emphasized her protective instincts toward children, describing an "immense" drive to safeguard them, which she linked to her aspirations for parenthood. However, she qualified her hopes by noting that such decisions depend on mutual readiness with a partner, adding that "love is unpredictable" and the outcome is not solely in her control.

These comments came amid speculation about her personal life, including rumored involvement with actor Tom Cruise, though De Armas has not confirmed any relationship influencing her family plans. Prior to this, De Armas has not had children; her early marriage to Spanish student Marc Clotet from 2011 to 2013 produced no offspring, and subsequent high-profile relationships, such as with Ben Affleck, did not result in family expansion. Her aspirations appear rooted in personal instinct rather than career milestones, as she has balanced demanding roles without indications of delaying motherhood for professional reasons.

### Ties to Cuba and political neutrality

Ana de Armas was born in Havana, Cuba, and resided there until age 18, when she relocated to Spain in 2006 to pursue acting opportunities. Her early life in post-Soviet Cuba involved a modest family environment marked by resource scarcity, including wearing hand-me-down clothing from her brother, as she later recounted in interviews reflecting on economic challenges under the regime's rationing system. She maintains familial connections, with her parents and relatives remaining in Cuba, fostering ongoing personal ties despite her international career.

De Armas has returned to Cuba periodically for family visits, including a notable trip in April 2023 ahead of her 35th birthday, where she arrived emotional and reunited with loved ones alongside her then-boyfriend, Paul Boulhak. In August 2024, she shared images from Havana, engaging with friends and local cultural sites like the National School of Art. These visits underscore her enduring heritage links, further illustrated by Hollywood actor Robert De Niro's unannounced 2023 meeting with her father in Cuba, which de Armas described as a gesture revealing personal bonds beyond professional circles.

Throughout her career, de Armas has refrained from public endorsements or criticisms of the Cuban government's policies, including its handling of dissent, economic controls, or events like the July 2021 protests, adopting a stance of political neutrality that prioritizes her professional image. This approach has faced scrutiny from regime critics, who view her silence amid documented human rights restrictions—such as arbitrary detentions and media censorship—as tacit acceptance or enabled by elite access unavailable to ordinary Cubans. Independent Cuban media have highlighted instances of her receiving preferential treatment during visits, interpreting it as alignment with state interests without overt advocacy.

Neutrality came under intensified debate in November 2024 following revelations of her brief romantic relationship with Manuel Anido Cuesta, stepson of Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel Bermúdez, a figurehead of the communist leadership continuity since Fidel Castro's era. The pairing, confirmed through public sightings in Madrid, elicited backlash from exile communities and dissidents, who accused de Armas of betraying her roots by associating with a family emblematic of the regime's authoritarian structure, responsible for suppressing opposition and perpetuating poverty through centralized control. In December 2024, when a Cuban journalist confronted Anido about these ties during a street encounter, de Armas intervened aggressively, reportedly insulting the reporter and defending her partner, an episode captured on video and cited as evidence of discomfort with scrutiny rather than principled detachment.

Supporters counter that personal relationships do not equate to political endorsement, emphasizing de Armas's direct experience of Cuba's hardships over two decades as context for her reticence, and noting her emigration as a rejection of stagnation under the system. The episode exemplifies tensions between celebrity privacy and expectations of diaspora activism, with no verified statements from de Armas affirming regime support or opposition, preserving her neutral public profile amid polarized interpretations.

## Public image

### Critical reception and acting critiques

Ana de Armas's acting has garnered praise for its emotional authenticity and versatility, particularly in roles requiring charm and moral complexity. In *Knives Out* (2019), her depiction of the principled nurse Marta Cabrera was highlighted for its nuance and warmth, with reviewers noting her ability to convey decency without sentimentality, establishing her as a standout in the ensemble. Critics credited her with expressing a wide range of emotions, from vulnerability to resolve, contributing significantly to the film's tension and appeal.

In action-driven parts, such as Paloma in *No Time to Die* (2021), de Armas was commended for her physicality and charisma, stealing scenes despite limited screen time—approximately five minutes—through effective stunt work and comedic timing in high-stakes sequences. Her preparation involved intensive training, enabling believable combat proficiency that enhanced the Bond franchise's dynamic.

De Armas's portrayal of Marilyn Monroe in *Blonde* (2022) elicited divided responses, earning a Golden Globe nomination but facing scrutiny over her Cuban accent persisting despite nine months of dialect coaching. Professional critiques often lauded the performance as "uncanny," "raw," and committed, with de Armas capturing Monroe's vulnerability and intellect amid the film's controversial narrative. However, some observers criticized it as one-note or unconvincing in vocal mimicry, contributing to broader debates on her suitability for the role. Public discourse has occasionally questioned her range beyond visual appeal, though such views contrast with acclaim for her transformative efforts in dramatic and physical demands.

### Casting controversies and merit debates

Ana de Armas' portrayal of Marilyn Monroe in the 2022 Netflix film *Blonde* generated substantial casting controversy, with detractors focusing on her Cuban-Spanish background and the authenticity of her American accent. Upon the trailer's release in July 2022, online commentators and Monroe enthusiasts criticized de Armas' vocal delivery, arguing it undermined the historical figure's essence and questioned the suitability of a non-American actress for the role. This backlash extended to broader concerns about cultural representation, with some asserting that de Armas' heritage precluded her from embodying an iconic U.S. symbol of mid-20th-century glamour.

The Marilyn Monroe Estate countered the criticism in an August 2022 statement, affirming the casting as "great" and noting de Armas' rigorous preparation, including dialect coaching to approximate Monroe's speech patterns. Producer Brad Pitt echoed this support, highlighting de Armas' dedication and ability to convey Monroe's vulnerability amid the film's artistic liberties drawn from Joyce Carol Oates' novel. Despite these endorsements, the dispute underscored tensions in Hollywood over prioritizing biographical fidelity versus interpretive casting, particularly for roles tied to national identity.

Debates on de Armas' merit as an actress intensified post-*Blonde*, where her performance divided audiences and critics despite earning an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress on January 24, 2023. Proponents lauded her physical transformation and emotional intensity, crediting her with humanizing Monroe's traumas, while skeptics contended the role exposed limitations in her range, relying more on visual allure than nuanced interpretation. Ben Affleck, her co-star in the 2022 thriller *Deep Water*, publicly questioned the nomination's merit, implying it overlooked substantive acting benchmarks in favor of controversy-driven buzz. De Armas addressed the polarization in March 2023 interviews, defending the film's unflinching depiction as a tribute rather than exploitation, though she acknowledged anticipating fan backlash due to its raw exploration of Monroe's life. These exchanges reflect ongoing scrutiny of her transition from supporting roles to prestige leads, with some attributing her ascent to marketability over proven versatility across genres.

### Industry stances and cultural backlash

Ana de Armas has advocated for originality in character creation amid ongoing debates over diversity initiatives in Hollywood. In April 2025, she argued that altering established male characters, such as James Bond, through gender swaps undermines storytelling, urging the industry instead to develop new roles that reflect diverse backgrounds without retrofitting icons. This position aligns with critiques of performative inclusivity but has not drawn widespread industry opposition, reflecting her growing influence in commercial cinema.

Her portrayal of Marilyn Monroe in the 2022 film *Blonde* elicited cultural backlash centered on her Cuban heritage and accent, with online critics and fans questioning whether a non-American actress could authentically embody the icon's voice and mannerisms following the trailer's release in July 2022. De Armas worked with dialect coaches to mitigate the accent, yet detractors highlighted persistent Hollywood biases against foreign inflections, as echoed by actors like Diego Luna in contemporaneous discussions. Industry figures countered this, with the Marilyn Monroe Estate issuing a statement on August 1, 2022, praising the casting as "great" and emphasizing de Armas' preparation and talent. Producer Brad Pitt also defended her amid the uproar, attributing criticism to superficial judgments rather than substantive review. De Armas later reflected in March 2023 that such reactions reveal underlying toxicity in the entertainment environment, particularly toward women in provocative roles.

A more pronounced cultural backlash emerged in November 2024 from the Cuban exile community over de Armas' relationship with Manuel Anido Cuesta, stepson of Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel, whom critics accused of indirect regime endorsement given Anido's family ties to the communist government. This intensified on December 3, 2024, when de Armas confronted and insulted a Cuban journalist questioning her boyfriend's regime connections during a public event, prompting accusations of defensiveness and evasion on human rights issues. Cuban dissident outlets further criticized her for past actions, including the 2019 film *Wasp Network*'s sympathetic depiction of regime spies—which earned a 40% Rotten Tomatoes score—and her silence amid Cuba's 2022 energy crisis and protests, despite state privileges like premiering *Blonde* on the island. By December 7, 2024, de Armas disabled Instagram comments amid escalating user frustrations, highlighting tensions between her heritage, neutrality claims, and perceived alignment with authoritarian elements. These episodes underscore fault lines in diaspora politics, where exile voices, often skeptical of celebrity impartiality, prioritize anti-regime advocacy over personal privacy.

### Television

Ana de Armas began her television career shortly after relocating from Cuba to Madrid, Spain, at age 18 in 2006, seeking greater acting opportunities unavailable in Cuba's limited industry. Her debut came in the Spanish TV film *El edén perdido* (2007), where she portrayed Gloria, a supporting role in a drama about a Spanish man's journey to reclaim family properties in Cuba during the 1930s.

De Armas achieved her breakthrough with the lead role of Carolina "Carol" Leal Solís in the mystery thriller series *El internado* (2007–2010), a popular Antena 3 production centered on students uncovering dark secrets at a remote boarding school. She appeared in 66 episodes across all six seasons, depicting Carol as a resilient, inquisitive teenager entangled in supernatural and criminal plots, which helped establish her as a rising star in Spanish television. The series' success, drawing millions of viewers per episode, marked her transition from novice to prominent actress.

Following *El internado*, she starred as Nerea in the historical drama *Hispania, la leyenda* (2010–2012), playing a young woman amid Lusitanian resistance against Roman conquest in ancient Iberia. Airing on Antena 3, the series featured her in romantic and action-oriented storylines opposite leads like Roberto Enríquez as Viriato, contributing to its narrative of cultural defiance. De Armas appeared in multiple episodes during the first season, leveraging the role to build on her growing reputation before shifting focus to film.

In 2023, de Armas hosted an episode of *Saturday Night Live* on April 15, participating in sketches such as a disruptive Spanish class and an album recording session, showcasing her comedic timing alongside cast members. This appearance highlighted her versatility beyond dramatic roles, though it was not a recurring acting commitment. Her early television work in Spain provided foundational experience in ensemble dynamics and long-form storytelling, paving the way for international film success.

### Other media

De Armas has featured prominently in luxury brand advertising campaigns. In September 2021, she starred in the Natural Diamond Council's "For Moments Like No Other" campaign, which highlighted the enduring value of natural diamonds through personal narratives. That same month, she appeared in Cartier's "Celebrate Moments of Love" advertisement, showcasing diamond jewelry in scenes emphasizing emotional connections. By July 2023, de Armas served as ambassador for De Beers' Blossom Fine Jewelry Collection, promoting its stackable, feminine designs in a video campaign. In 2024, she reprised her Natural Diamond Council role in additional global advertisements. She also fronted Estée Lauder's "I Am Beautiful" holiday blockbuster, featuring nine full-size products and a soundtrack by Maggie Rogers, which aired extensively on television. Later that year, de Armas modeled Louis Vuitton's Le Damier jewelry line in a campaign emphasizing pattern heritage. By May 2025, she starred in Louis Vuitton's "Virtuosity" jewelry ads, focusing on innovative craftsmanship. Overall, her commercials have logged over 34,000 national TV airings in recent months across 17 campaigns.

In video games, de Armas provided voice work for the Eve Maccaro operator, dubbed the Ballerina, introduced in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Season 4 on May 22, 2025.
