## Historical Background

### Early Years and Founding
The Walt Disney Company began as the Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio in 1923, established by Walt Disney and Roy O. Disney in Los Angeles. Their early work included a series of short films called the *Alice Comedies*, which combined live-action and animation. In 1928, Walt Disney created Mickey Mouse, a character that debuted in the short film *Steamboat Willie*, marking one of the first synchronized sound cartoons. Mickey quickly became a global sensation, establishing Disney as a pioneer in animation [History.com - Walt Disney](https://www.history.com/topics/walt-disney).

### Expansion into Feature Films
In 1937, Disney released *Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs*, the first full-length animated feature film, which was a groundbreaking success both critically and commercially. This achievement set the stage for a string of classic animated films, including *Pinocchio* (1940), *Dumbo* (1941), and *Cinderella* (1950). These films solidified Disney’s reputation for storytelling and innovation in animation [Britannica - Walt Disney](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Walt-Disney).

### Diversification and Theme Parks
The 1950s marked Disney’s expansion beyond animation. In 1955, Disneyland, the first Disney theme park, opened in Anaheim, California, introducing a new form of family entertainment. Walt Disney envisioned a place where families could experience magic together, and Disneyland became a blueprint for future parks worldwide. During this period, Disney also ventured into television with shows like *The Mickey Mouse Club* and live-action films [Disney Parks Blog - History of Disneyland](https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/disneyland-resort-history/).

### Post-Walt Era and Modern Growth
After Walt Disney’s death in 1966, the company faced challenges but continued to grow under new leadership. The opening of Walt Disney World in Florida in 1971 expanded the theme park empire. The 1980s and 1990s saw a renaissance in animation with films like *The Little Mermaid* (1989), *Beauty and the Beast* (1991), and *The Lion King* (1994), alongside strategic acquisitions such as Pixar Animation Studios (2006), Marvel Entertainment (2009), Lucasfilm (2012), and 21st Century Fox (2019). These acquisitions broadened Disney’s content library and market reach [CNN Business - Disney Acquisitions](https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/20/media/disney-fox-deal/index.html).
