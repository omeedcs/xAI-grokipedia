## Historical Background

### Early Life and Education
Steve Jobs was born in San Francisco, California, to Abdulfattah Jandali and Joanne Schieble, who placed him for adoption shortly after his birth. He was adopted by Paul and Clara Jobs, a working-class couple from Mountain View, California. Growing up in the Silicon Valley area, Jobs developed an early interest in electronics, often tinkering with gadgets in his father’s workshop. He attended Reed College in Portland, Oregon, in 1972 but dropped out after six months, citing a lack of direction and financial strain on his parents. However, he continued auditing classes, including a calligraphy course that later influenced Apple’s focus on typography and design [Biography.com](https://www.biography.com/business-leaders/steve-jobs).

### Founding Apple and Early Success
In 1976, Jobs co-founded Apple Computer, Inc. with Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne in the garage of his parents’ home. Their first product, the Apple I, was a rudimentary computer kit aimed at hobbyists. The following year, the Apple II became one of the first successful mass-produced personal computers, propelling Apple into a leading position in the nascent computer industry. Jobs’ emphasis on user-friendly design and marketing helped distinguish Apple from competitors like IBM [History of Apple](https://www.history.com/topics/inventions/steve-jobs-and-apple).

### Departure from Apple and Return
By 1985, internal conflicts at Apple, particularly with CEO John Sculley, led to Jobs’ departure from the company he co-founded. During his hiatus, Jobs founded NeXT Inc., a computer platform development company, and acquired The Graphics Group, which later became Pixar Animation Studios. Pixar’s collaboration with Disney produced groundbreaking animated films like *Toy Story* (1995), the first fully computer-animated feature film [Pixar History](https://www.pixar.com/our-story). Meanwhile, Apple struggled without Jobs, facing declining market share. In 1997, Apple acquired NeXT, bringing Jobs back as an advisor and later as CEO. His return marked the beginning of a dramatic turnaround for the company [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2011/10/5/3471468/steve-jobs-apple-turnaround).
