Located in the northwestern part of the country, Seoul serves as the political, cultural, economic, and social hub of South Korea. With a population of approximately 9.7 million people as of 2023, it is one of the most densely populated cities in the world and a global leader in technology, education, and innovation [Statistics Korea](https://kostat.go.kr/portal/eng/index.action). Spanning an area of about 605 square kilometers (233 square miles), Seoul is situated along the Han River, which has historically played a vital role in the city's development.\n\nSeoul is a city of contrasts, where ancient palaces and temples stand alongside modern skyscrapers and bustling markets. It is a major global city, ranking high in indices for quality of life, economic competitiveness, and technological advancement. As the heart of South Korea, Seoul is not only a center for governance but also a cultural powerhouse, influencing trends in fashion, music, and entertainment worldwide through phenomena like K-pop and Korean dramas [Visit Seoul](https://english.visitseoul.net/index).\n\n## Historical Background\n\nSeoul's history dates back over 2,000 years, with evidence of human settlement in the area since the Paleolithic era. The city became prominent during the Baekje Kingdom (18 BCE–660 CE), one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea, when it was known as Wiryeseong and served as a capital [Korea.net](https://www.korea.net/AboutKorea/History/Three-Kingdoms). However, Seoul's status as a central hub solidified in 1394 when it was chosen as the capital of the newly established Joseon Dynasty (1392–1897) by King Taejo. During this period, the city was named \"Hanyang,\" and significant landmarks such as Gyeongbokgung Palace and the city walls were constructed [Cultural Heritage Administration](http://english.cha.go.kr/).\n\nUnder Joseon rule, Seoul became the political and cultural center of Korea, with a rigid class system and a focus on Confucian ideals. The city faced numerous challenges, including invasions during the Imjin War (1592–1598) by Japan and later conflicts with the Qing Dynasty. In the late 19th century, Seoul opened to foreign influence during the Korean Empire (1897–1910), adopting modernization efforts before falling under Japanese colonial rule from 1910 to 1945. During this period, much of the city's traditional architecture and culture were suppressed or altered [Encyclopedia Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/place/Seoul).\n\nAfter Korea's liberation in 1945 and the subsequent Korean War (1950–1953), Seoul was devastated, with much of its infrastructure destroyed. However, the city underwent rapid reconstruction and industrialization during the late 20th century, often referred to as the \"Miracle on the Han River.\" This transformation turned Seoul into a modern metropolis and a symbol of South Korea's economic success [Seoul Metropolitan Government](https://english.seoul.go.kr/).\n\n## Current Status and Relevance\n\nToday, Seoul is a global city and a key player in international affairs. It serves as the political center of South Korea, housing the Blue House (now replaced by the Yongsan Presidential Office as of 2022) and the National Assembly. Economically, Seoul is a powerhouse, contributing significantly to South Korea's GDP and hosting the headquarters of major corporations like Samsung, Hyundai, and LG [Korea Economic Institute](http://www.keia.org/).\n\nSeoul is also a cultural epicenter, driving the global popularity of Korean culture, or \"Hallyu.\" The city's Gangnam district, famously referenced in Psy's 2012 hit song \"Gangnam Style,\" symbolizes modern affluence and trendsetting lifestyles [BBC News](https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-18991360). Additionally, Seoul is a leader in technology, with widespread high-speed internet and smart city initiatives, earning it recognition as one of the most connected cities in the world [Smart City Seoul](https://smartcity.seoul.go.kr/).\n\nPolitically, Seoul's location near the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) underscores its strategic importance, as tensions with North Korea remain a significant concern. The city also faces domestic challenges, including housing affordability, air pollution, and an aging population, which the local government is actively addressing through urban planning and sustainability initiatives [Seoul Solution](https://seoulsolution.kr/en).\n\n## Notable Facts and Details\n\n- **Population and Density**: As of 2023, Seoul's population is around 9.7 million, making it one of the largest urban centers in the world.
