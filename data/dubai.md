## Overview
Dubai is one of the seven emirates that constitute the United Arab Emirates (UAE), a federation in the Arabian Peninsula. Located on the southeast coast of the Persian Gulf, Dubai is the largest and most populous emirate in the UAE, known for its rapid transformation from a small fishing village to a global hub for trade, tourism, and finance. The city of Dubai, which serves as the emirate's capital, is often synonymous with the emirate itself and is renowned for its futuristic skyline, luxury lifestyle, and ambitious architectural projects like the Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world. Dubai's economy, once reliant on pearl diving and trade, now thrives on tourism, real estate, and financial services, making it a key player in the Middle East's economic landscape [Dubai Government Portal](https://www.dubai.ae/en).

## Historical Background
Dubai's history dates back to at least 3000 BCE, with archaeological evidence suggesting early human settlement in the region. However, its documented history begins in the 18th century when the Al Maktoum family, part of the Bani Yas tribe, established control over the area. By the early 19th century, Dubai emerged as a small fishing and pearling village with a population of around 800 people, primarily dependent on the sea for sustenance [UAE National Archives](https://www.na.ae/en/).

- **19th Century Growth**: Dubai's strategic location along trade routes between Europe, Asia, and Africa made it a vital port. In 1833, the Al Maktoum dynasty solidified its rule, and by the late 1800s, Dubai became a key trading hub under British protection through the "Trucial States" agreements. The establishment of a free port with minimal taxes attracted merchants from across the region [Britannica - Dubai](https://www.britannica.com/place/Dubai-emirate-United-Arab-Emirates).
- **20th Century Transformation**: The discovery of oil in 1966 marked a turning point for Dubai. Under the visionary leadership of Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum, oil revenues were reinvested into infrastructure, diversifying the economy beyond oil. By the time the UAE was formed in 1971, Dubai was poised for rapid modernization [History of UAE](https://www.government.ae/en/about-the-uae/history).
- **Late 20th to Early 21st Century**: Post-1970s, Dubai focused on becoming a global city. Initiatives like the creation of Jebel Ali Port (one of the largest man-made harbors) and free trade zones attracted international businesses. The emirate also invested heavily in tourism, with landmarks like the Burj Al Arab (opened in 1999) symbolizing its ambition [Jebel Ali Free Zone](https://www.jafza.ae/).
