  "content": "# Dark matter\n\nDark matter is a form of matter that does not interact with light or other electromagnetic radiation, rendering it invisible to conventional telescopes, yet it reveals its presence through gravitational effects on visible matter, radiation, and the large-scale structure of the universe. It comprises approximately 27% of the total mass-energy content of the universe, compared to just 5% for ordinary baryonic matter and 68% for dark energy. Unlike ordinary matter, dark matter's composition remains unknown, but it is hypothesized to consist of exotic particles or other non-luminous entities that interact primarily through gravity and possibly the weak nuclear force.\n\nThe evidence for dark matter's existence stems from multiple independent astronomical observations. In the 1930s, Fritz Zwicky inferred unseen mass in galaxy clusters like the Coma Cluster based on the high velocities of galaxies, suggesting far more mass than visible stars could account for. Decades later, in the 1970s, Vera Rubin's studies of spiral galaxy rotation curves showed that stars orbit at unexpectedly flat speeds far from the galactic center, implying a massive, invisible halo of dark matter enveloping each galaxy. Further confirmation comes from gravitational lensing, where the bending of light around clusters reveals mass distributions inconsistent with visible matter alone, as dramatically illustrated by the Bullet Cluster collision in 2006, where hot gas (ordinary matter) separated from the gravitational mass. The cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation also provides robust evidence: tiny temperature fluctuations (ΔT/T ≈ 10⁻⁵) in the CMB require dark matter to seed the growth of cosmic structures through gravitational instability.\n\nDark matter plays a pivotal role in cosmology and astrophysics by providing the gravitational scaffolding for the universe's evolution. It clusters under its own gravity to form vast halos that guide the formation and distribution of galaxies, without which the observed large-scale structure—filaments, walls, and voids—could not have developed from the early universe's near-uniform state. Its properties include having mass and occupying space, but it neither emits, absorbs, nor reflects light significantly, and it is likely \"cold\" (non-relativistic, slow-moving particles) to match simulations of structure formation. Dark matter is also stable over cosmological timescales (billions of years) and abundant—about five times more than ordinary matter—with particle masses constrained to be greater than a few keV to avoid disrupting small-scale structures.\n\nLeading particle candidates for dark matter include weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), axions, and sterile neutrinos, often arising from extensions to the Standard Model of particle physics; non-particle candidates include primordial black holes. Ongoing searches involve direct detection experiments (e.g., seeking rare interactions with ordinary matter underground), indirect detection (looking for annihilation products like gamma rays), and collider experiments at facilities like the Large Hadron Collider, though no definitive detection has occurred as of 2025. These efforts, combined with upcoming missions like NASA's Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, aim to map dark matter distributions more precisely and test theoretical models.\n\n## Definition and Characteristics\n\n### Technical Definition\n\nDark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that does not interact with electromagnetic radiation or other forms of light, making it invisible to telescopes and detectable solely through its gravitational influence on visible matter and the large-scale structure of the universe. The term \"dark\" specifically denotes this lack of interaction across all wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum, allowing dark matter to affect gravity without emitting, absorbing, or reflecting photons.\n\nThis distinguishes dark matter from ordinary baryonic matter, which comprises atoms made of protons, neutrons, and electrons that interact via the electromagnetic force, enabling them to form stars, planets, and other luminous structures. In contrast, dark energy is a separate component that drives the accelerated expansion of the universe, counteracting gravitational attraction on cosmological scales rather than contributing to it.\n\nWithin the standard Lambda cold dark matter (ΛCDM) model of cosmology, dark matter accounts for approximately 27% of the universe's total mass-energy content, as inferred from cosmic microwave background observations by the Planck satellite. The corresponding density parameter is $\\Omega_{\\rm dm} \\approx 0.27$, representing the fraction of the critical density attributed to dark matter in a flat universe.\n\nThe term \"dark matter\" was coined by Swiss astronomer Fritz Zwicky in 1933 while studying galaxy clusters.\n\n### Physical Properties\n\nDark matter is classified into categories based on the velocities of its constituent particles during the early universe, particularly around the time of matter-radiation equality. Cold dark matter (CDM) consists of non-relativistic particles with velocities much less than the speed of light, enabling the formation of small-scale structures through hierarchical clustering, where smaller halos merge to form larger ones over cosmic time. Warm dark matter (WDM) consists of particles with intermediate velocities, leading to free-streaming lengths that suppress structure formation on small scales more than CDM but less than HDM. In contrast, hot dark matter (HDM) comprises relativistic particles that move at speeds close to light, leading to free-streaming lengths that suppress the formation of small-scale structures by smoothing out density perturbations on those scales. This distinction is crucial for matching observed cosmic structure, with CDM being the favored paradigm for explaining the observed distribution of galaxies and clusters.\n\nA prominent example of cold dark matter candidates is weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), hypothetical particles that interact primarily through the weak nuclear force and gravity. WIMPs are expected to have masses in the range of approximately 10 to 1000 GeV/c², with annihilation cross-sections on the order of the weak interaction scale (around 3 × 10^{-26} cm³/s), allowing them to achieve the observed cosmic relic density through thermal freeze-out in the early universe. This \"WIMP miracle\" arises naturally in extensions of the Standard Model, such as supersymmetry, where the required properties emerge without fine-tuning.\n\nDark matter is generally assumed to be collisionless, meaning its particles interact with each other only through gravity and not via significant self-interactions, which leads to specific predictions for halo density profiles in numerical simulations. In cold dark matter simulations, this collisionless behavior results in cuspy central density profiles, where the density ρ scales as ρ ∝ r^{-1} in the inner regions of halos, as characterized by the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile. These cusps arise from the efficient clustering of collisionless particles in high-density regions during gravitational collapse.\n\nFor dark matter to constitute the observed fraction of the universe's energy density today, its particles must be stable or extremely long-lived, with lifetimes exceeding the age of the universe (approximately 13.8 billion years) to avoid significant decay since the early universe. This stability requirement ensures that the relic abundance produced in the early universe persists, influencing large-scale structure formation without dilution from decays.\n\nIn dark matter-dominated systems, such as galaxy halos, the virial theorem relates the velocity dispersion σ of particles to the system's gravitational potential. For a virialized halo of mass M and radius r, the theorem yields\n\n$$\n\\sigma^2 \\propto \\frac{GM}{r},\n$$\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, reflecting the balance between kinetic energy and gravitational potential energy in equilibrium. This relation provides a key constraint on dark matter dynamics in bound structures.\n\n## Historical Development\n\n### Early Indications\n\nIn the early 20th century, astronomical observations began to reveal discrepancies between the visible mass in stellar systems and the dynamics inferred from their motions, prompting initial suggestions of unseen matter. In 1922, Dutch astronomer Jacobus Kapteyn analyzed star counts and proper motions to model the structure of the Milky Way, proposing that the total mass density exceeded what could be accounted for by luminous stars alone. Kapteyn's dynamical interpretation indicated the presence of non-luminous or \"dark\" matter to balance the gravitational forces required by observed stellar velocities.\n\nBuilding on Kapteyn's work, Jan Oort conducted a detailed study in 1932 of the vertical oscillations of stars near the galactic plane in the solar neighborhood. By applying Poisson's equation to the distribution of stellar velocities perpendicular to the disk, Oort calculated the local mass density and found it to be approximately twice that contributed by visible stars and gas. This implied an additional unseen mass component, roughly equal to the luminous mass, to explain the equilibrium of the galactic disk against its own gravity.\n\nA more dramatic indication emerged from extragalactic observations in 1933, when Fritz Zwicky examined the Coma Cluster of galaxies. Using early radial velocity measurements from a handful of member galaxies, Zwicky computed the cluster's velocity dispersion, which reached up to 1,000 km/s—far exceeding what the visible mass, estimated from photographic magnitudes, could gravitationally sustain. Applying a rudimentary form of the virial theorem, he determined that the total mass was about 400 times greater than the luminous mass, introducing the term \"missing mass\" (dunkle Materie) to describe this invisible component holding the cluster together.\n\nZwicky's findings received independent corroboration in 1936 from Sinclair Smith, who analyzed radial velocities of galaxies in the Virgo Cluster. Smith's application of the virial theorem to 32 cluster members yielded a dynamical mass roughly 100–200 times the visible mass, confirming the need for substantial unseen material in galaxy clusters beyond the Milky Way. These early calculations laid the groundwork for later investigations, such as those by Vera Rubin in the 1970s, which extended the evidence to galactic rotation dynamics.\n\n### Modern Formulation\n\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, theoretical expectations for galactic dynamics clashed with observations, prompting the need for unseen mass. Ken Freeman's 1970 analysis of spiral and S0 galaxy disks highlighted discrepancies between predicted and observed rotation curves, where the visible mass alone could not account for the stability and extent of galactic disks, suggesting the presence of additional unseen matter. This work laid the groundwork for interpreting subsequent observations as evidence for dark matter halos surrounding galaxies.\n\nBuilding on this, Vera Rubin and Kent Ford conducted pioneering optical spectroscopy in the 1970s, measuring rotation curves for numerous spiral galaxies, including Andromeda (M31). Their 1970 study of emission regions in M31 revealed velocities that remained roughly constant out to large radii, far beyond what luminous matter could support, indicating a massive dark halo. Extending this to 21 Sc galaxies in 1980, Rubin, Ford, and Thonnard confirmed flat rotation curves across a wide luminosity range, with velocities rising slowly or plateauing even at the outermost measured points, reinforcing the requirement for dark matter to explain the dynamics. These findings from Rubin's key papers between 1970 and 1980 established dark matter as essential for galactic structure.\n\nParallel advances in computational modeling supported hierarchical structure formation dominated by dark matter. Sverre Aarseth's early N-body simulations in the 1960s demonstrated gravitational clustering in self-gravitating systems, evolving into tools for simulating dark matter-dominated universes. By 1974, William Press and Paul Schechter formalized this in their excursion-set theory, predicting the mass function of collapsed objects like galaxies through self-similar gravitational condensation of Gaussian density fluctuations, providing a statistical framework for dark matter halo abundance.\n\nThe 1980s saw the emergence of the Cold Dark Matter (CDM) paradigm, integrating inflation-produced primordial fluctuations with hierarchical clustering. P. J. E. Peebles' 1982 model proposed non-relativistic, collisionless particles as the dark matter component, generating large-scale structure via gravitational instability on scales matching observations. George Blumenthal and colleagues in 1984 formalized the CDM cosmology, combining inflationary initial conditions with cold particles to explain galaxy formation and clustering, predicting a universe with a matter density parameter dominated by non-baryonic dark matter.\n\nIn the 1990s, cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations solidified the CDM framework. The COBE satellite's 1992 detection of CMB anisotropies by George Smoot and colleagues confirmed the scale-invariant spectrum predicted by inflation in CDM models, with subsequent analyses indicating a total matter density Ω_m ≈ 0.3, the majority non-baryonic to match big bang nucleosynthesis constraints. By 2000, this paradigm was firmly established, later confirmed by phenomena like the Bullet Cluster collision.\n\n### Recent Progress\n\nIn the early 2000s, the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) satellite provided precise measurements of the cosmic microwave background, refining the dark matter density parameter to \\(\\Omega_\\mathrm{dm} = 0.23 \\pm 0.04\\) and strengthening the foundation of the Lambda cold dark matter (\\(\\Lambda\\)CDM) model. These results, based on data from 2001 to 2010, confirmed that dark matter constitutes approximately 23% of the universe's energy density, aligning with inflationary cosmology and flat geometry predictions.\n\nDuring the 2010s, small-scale structure observations revealed tensions in the cold dark matter (CDM) paradigm, notably the core-cusp problem—where simulated dark matter halos predict cuspy density profiles at galactic centers, contrasting with the observed cored profiles in dwarf galaxies—and the missing satellites problem, which highlights fewer observed satellite galaxies around the Milky Way than CDM simulations forecast. These discrepancies, quantified through N-body simulations and kinematic data from galaxies like Draco and Sculptor, prompted investigations into baryonic feedback effects and alternative dark matter models to reconcile theory with observations.\n\nThe 2020s brought further cosmological refinements, with the Planck satellite's 2018 analysis confirming a cold dark matter density of \\(\\Omega_\\mathrm{dm} \\approx 0.26\\), derived from combined temperature and polarization data spanning multiple angular scales. Complementing this, the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) results from 2024 and 2025, based on baryon acoustic oscillation measurements from more than 14 million galaxies and quasars, supported a consistent dark matter density while providing hints of evolving dark energy, with the dark energy equation-of-state parameter deviating from a cosmological constant at around 3-4 sigma significance.\n\nIn 2025, theoretical advancements proposed novel origins for dark matter, including a University of California, Santa Cruz study suggesting it could arise from a \"mirror world\"—a hidden sector with symmetric particles and forces that interact gravitationally but minimally with ordinary matter, potentially explaining the matter-dark matter density coincidence. Similarly, researchers at York University introduced the concept of light-tinting effects, where light passing through dark matter could acquire subtle chromatic shifts (red or blue tints) through interactions with weakly interacting massive particles, potentially via intermediate mediators like the Higgs boson and top quark, offering a potential indirect detection signature distinguishable by particle type.\n\nNull results from experimental searches continued to constrain dark matter candidates, with the LUX-ZEPLIN experiment in 2024 setting upper limits on weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) spin-independent cross-sections below \\(10^{-47}\\) cm² for masses around 30-50 GeV/c², based on 220 live days of data from its 5.5-tonne liquid xenon detector. Likewise, Large Hadron Collider (LHC) Run 3 analyses through 2025, utilizing up to 140 fb⁻¹ of proton-proton collisions at 13.6 TeV, yielded no evidence for dark matter production in channels like mono-jets or disappearing tracks, tightening exclusions on simplified supersymmetric models. Ongoing direct detection efforts, such as those at LZ, continue to probe these limits with increased exposure.\n\n## Observational Evidence\n\n### Galactic-Scale Evidence\n\nOne of the primary pieces of evidence for dark matter in galaxies comes from the observed rotation curves of spiral galaxies, which measure the orbital velocities of stars and gas as a function of radial distance from the galactic center. In a galaxy dominated by visible matter distributed like a central point mass, Keplerian dynamics would predict that rotation velocities \\( v(r) \\) decline as \\( v \\propto 1/\\sqrt{r} \\) at large radii, similar to planetary orbits around the Sun. However, spectroscopic observations reveal that beyond the optical radius—where most luminous matter resides—rotation velocities remain approximately constant, with \\( v(r) \\approx \\) constant, implying an enclosed mass \\( M(r) \\propto r \\) that increases linearly with radius to sustain the flat curve.\n\nThis phenomenon was first clearly demonstrated in the Andromeda galaxy (M31) through high-resolution spectroscopic surveys of emission lines, showing velocities rising to about 225 km/s at 400 pc and then flattening out to large distances without the expected decline. The flat rotation curve requires additional unseen mass, as luminous matter alone cannot account for the observed dynamics; dark matter halos provide the necessary extended mass distribution. Numerical simulations of cold dark matter cosmologies predict that dark matter halos follow a universal density profile, such as the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile, given by\n\n\\[\n\\rho(r) = \\frac{\\rho_s}{(r/r_s)(1 + r/r_s)^2},\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( \\rho_s \\) is a characteristic density and \\( r_s \\) is a scale radius; this cuspy profile fits observed rotation curves well by yielding the required mass buildup at large radii.\n\nDwarf galaxies and low-surface-brightness (LSB) galaxies serve as particularly clean probes of dark matter, as their low stellar content results in dark matter fractions exceeding 90% in the outer regions, making baryonic contributions negligible in mass models. In these systems, rotation curves remain flat even at small radii, reinforcing the need for a dominant dark halo. Similarly, the Tully-Fisher relation empirically links a galaxy's infrared luminosity (a proxy for stellar mass) to its maximum rotation velocity, with brighter spirals exhibiting higher velocities, consistent with virialized dark matter halos of varying sizes scaling the total mass.\n\nModern neutral hydrogen (HI) surveys, such as the THINGS (The HI Nearby Galaxy Survey), provide high-resolution rotation curves for nearby spirals and dwarfs, confirming dark matter's dominance in the outskirts where velocities plateau at 100–250 km/s over scales of 10–30 kpc, far beyond the stellar disk. These data underscore that visible matter contributes less than 20% to the total dynamical mass in the extended regions. Evidence extends briefly to elliptical galaxies, where stellar velocity dispersions indicate similarly massive dark halos enclosing the luminous component.\n\n### Cluster-Scale Evidence\n\nGalaxy clusters provide compelling evidence for dark matter through the analysis of galaxy motions and gravitational effects on scales encompassing hundreds of galaxies. Fritz Zwicky first inferred the presence of substantial unseen mass in the Coma Cluster by applying the virial theorem to measured galaxy velocities, estimating a velocity dispersion of approximately 1000 km/s, which required a total mass several times greater than the visible stellar content. Modern spectroscopic surveys confirm this high velocity dispersion at σ ≈ 1050 km/s for Coma, yielding a mass-to-light ratio of around 350 in solar units within the virial radius, implying that dark matter constitutes 5-10 times the visible mass to maintain dynamical equilibrium. The virial mass estimator, M_vir = 3σ² R / G, where σ is the line-of-sight velocity dispersion, R is the characteristic radius, and G is the gravitational constant, underpins these calculations and highlights the dominance of non-luminous matter in binding clusters.\n\nA striking demonstration of dark matter's collisionless nature comes from merging galaxy clusters, where the separation of components during collisions reveals its distribution. In the Bullet Cluster (1E 0657-56), observations from 2006 using Chandra X-ray data and Hubble weak lensing showed a clear offset between the hot intracluster gas—detected via X-ray emission—and the gravitational mass peaks inferred from lensing, with the latter aligning more closely with the collisionless galaxies post-merger. This separation, with dark matter halos passing through each other with minimal interaction while the baryonic gas dissipates energy through collisions, provides direct evidence that over 80% of the cluster mass is non-interacting dark matter rather than ordinary matter.\n\nHydrostatic equilibrium analyses of X-ray emitting gas in relaxed Abell clusters further quantify dark matter's prevalence. By modeling the intracluster medium's pressure support against gravity, studies of clusters like Abell 2029 and Abell 1689 reveal total masses where dark matter accounts for approximately 80-90% of the content within the virial radius, far exceeding the baryonic gas fraction of 10-15%. These estimates assume spherical symmetry and isothermal conditions, consistent with the observed temperature profiles, and underscore dark matter's role in providing the gravitational potential well.\n\nWeak gravitational lensing surveys complement these dynamical probes by mapping the total mass distribution independently of light. Data from the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey have produced mass maps of galaxy clusters showing extended dark matter halos that envelop visible galaxies and extend beyond the X-ray gas, confirming halo masses 10-20 times the stellar content in representative systems. Similarly, Hubble Space Telescope observations in programs like CLASH have resolved weak lensing shear in clusters such as Abell 1689, revealing dark matter concentrations that align with virial estimates and demonstrate smooth, extended profiles indicative of cold dark matter halos. These lensing maps provide unbiased tracers of dark matter on cluster scales, reinforcing its necessity for explaining observed structures.\n\n### Cosmological-Scale Evidence\n\nCosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies provide key evidence for dark matter on cosmological scales through the angular power spectrum, particularly the position of the first acoustic peak, which is sensitive to the total matter density parameter Ω_m h². The Planck 2018 measurements of the CMB temperature and polarization power spectra yield Ω_m h² ≈ 0.1430 ± 0.0011, indicating that the universe's matter content is dominated by non-baryonic components. The baryon density from the same data is Ω_b h² ≈ 0.0224 ± 0.0001, comprising less than 20% of the total matter budget, with the remainder attributed to dark matter to match the observed peak positions in the ΛCDM model.\n\nBaryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) imprint a characteristic sound horizon scale from the early universe, serving as a standard ruler that probes dark matter's role in cosmic expansion and structure growth within ΛCDM. Measurements from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) have mapped this scale across low redshifts, confirming the angular diameter distance and supporting dark matter densities consistent with CMB inferences. Recent Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) 2024 BAO data from galaxy, quasar, and Lyman-α forest tracers further refine the sound horizon at z ≈ 0.5–3.5, yielding cosmological parameters that align with ΛCDM and require cold dark matter to explain the observed clustering amplitude.\n\nType Ia supernovae, used as standard candles via their distance modulus as a function of redshift, reveal the universe's accelerated expansion, necessitating dark matter and dark energy in a flat geometry. Combined analyses of supernova data fitting a flat ΛCDM model yield Ω_m ≈ 0.3 and Ω_Λ ≈ 0.7, with the matter density dominated by dark matter given the low baryon fraction from big bang nucleosynthesis.\n\nThe Lyman-α forest in high-redshift quasar spectra traces intergalactic hydrogen absorption, revealing the matter power spectrum P(k) on small scales (k ≳ 1 h Mpc⁻¹) that constrains dark matter properties. Observations show no significant suppression in P(k) at these scales, limiting hot dark matter contributions (such as massive neutrinos) to less than 10–20% of the total matter density, as hotter particles would free-stream and dampen structure formation. This supports cold dark matter as the primary component driving the observed power spectrum shape.\n\nGalaxy clustering on large scales matches cold dark matter simulations in the ΛCDM framework, reproducing the observed two-point correlation function and power spectrum amplitude through numerical N-body models. However, a σ_8 tension persists, with 2025 galaxy survey data (including DESI) measuring σ_8 ≈ 0.75–0.77, about 10% lower than the Planck CMB prediction of σ_8 ≈ 0.81, highlighting potential refinements needed in dark matter modeling or systematics.\n\n## Candidates for Dark Matter\n\n### Baryonic Candidates\n\nBaryonic candidates for dark matter encompass ordinary matter components that are dim or non-luminous, such as massive compact halo objects (MACHOs), brown dwarfs, rogue planets, and primordial gas clouds, which could potentially contribute to the gravitational effects attributed to dark matter without significant electromagnetic emission. These candidates are fundamentally limited by the total baryonic density of the universe, determined from Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) and cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements. BBN constrains the baryon-to-photon ratio to η ≈ 6.1 × 10^{-10}, corresponding to a present-day baryon density parameter of Ω_b h² ≈ 0.0224, while CMB observations indicate a total matter density of Ω_m ≈ 0.315; thus, baryons account for only about 16% of the total matter budget, leaving the majority of dark matter unexplained by ordinary matter.\n\nMACHOs, including stellar remnants, brown dwarfs, and rogue planets, represent compact baryonic objects that could populate galactic halos and cause gravitational microlensing of background stars. Dedicated microlensing surveys, such as EROS and MACHO in the 1990s and 2000s, monitored millions of stars in the Magellanic Clouds and detected only a handful of candidate events toward the Small Magellanic Cloud, consistent with MACHOs contributing less than 10% of the Milky Way halo mass for objects in the 0.1–1 M_⊙ range. Later analyses from the OGLE collaboration, spanning the 1990s to 2020s and focusing on the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, tightened these bounds further, limiting baryonic MACHOs to under 20% of the halo mass for masses below 0.1 M_⊙ based on the scarcity of observed events relative to predictions for a dark matter-dominated halo.\n\nBrown dwarfs, often termed \"failed stars\" due to their insufficient mass (roughly 13–80 Jupiter masses) for sustained hydrogen fusion, have been proposed as a distributed baryonic dark matter component. However, deep infrared surveys like 2MASS (completed in 2001) and WISE (launched in 2009) have cataloged thousands of these objects across the solar neighborhood and beyond, revealing a local space density of approximately 0.005–0.01 pc^{-3} and a mass density contribution of less than 0.3% of the local dynamical mass, far below the required halo density of ~0.01 M_⊙ pc^{-3}; these observations rule out brown dwarfs as the dominant dark matter constituent.\n\nPrimordial gas clouds and rogue planets face similar insurmountable constraints from BBN, as both are composed of baryons whose total abundance is capped by η ≈ 6 × 10^{-10}, yielding an insufficient density to match the observed dark matter distribution on galactic scales. Microlensing searches for low-mass rogue planets (planetary-mass MACHOs) from combined EROS and MACHO data in the 2000s further restrict their halo fraction to below 15% for masses around 10^{-5} M_⊙, reinforcing that no combination of baryonic forms can fully explain the dark matter.\n\n### Non-Baryonic Particle Candidates\n\nNon-baryonic particle candidates for dark matter encompass hypothetical particles beyond the Standard Model's baryonic matter, predicted by extensions of particle physics to explain the observed abundance of dark matter while evading Big Bang nucleosynthesis constraints on ordinary matter. These candidates are typically weakly interacting and non-relativistic in the present universe, allowing them to cluster gravitationally on galactic scales. Leading proposals include weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), axions, sterile neutrinos, ultralight fuzzy dark matter scalars, and particles from mirror world models, each motivated by distinct theoretical frameworks and addressing specific shortcomings in the Standard Model.\n\nWeakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) are among the most studied non-baryonic candidates, arising in supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model where the lightest supersymmetric particle, often the neutralino, remains stable and serves as dark matter. The neutralino, a neutral fermionic mixture of gauginos and higgsinos, decouples from thermal equilibrium in the early universe via the freeze-out mechanism, yielding a relic density that matches observations if the annihilation cross-section times velocity satisfies \\( \\langle \\sigma v \\rangle \\approx 3 \\\times 10^{-26} \\, \\mathrm{cm}^3/\\mathrm{s} \\). This \"WIMP miracle\" links the electroweak scale to the dark matter abundance without fine-tuning.\n\nAxions emerge as pseudoscalar particles in the Peccei-Quinn mechanism, introduced to dynamically resolve the strong CP problem in quantum chromodynamics by relaxing the theta parameter to zero. As dark matter, QCD axions acquire mass from non-perturbative QCD effects, spanning \\( 10^{-6} \\) to \\( 10^{-3} \\, \\mathrm{eV} \\), and are produced non-thermally via the misalignment mechanism in the early universe. Their detection prospects include conversion to photons via the Primakoff effect in strong magnetic fields, where axions scatter off virtual photons in atomic nuclei or plasma.\n\nSterile neutrinos, right-handed counterparts to active neutrinos, constitute warm dark matter candidates with masses in the 1-50 keV range, produced via non-thermal mechanisms like oscillations with active neutrinos or inflaton decays. These particles can explain observed pulsar velocity kicks through asymmetric two-body decays that impart momentum to the neutron star progenitor. A potential signature is the 3.5 keV X-ray emission line from sterile neutrino decays, observed in galaxy clusters and debated as of 2025 due to inconsistencies with blank-sky backgrounds and alternative atomic explanations.\n\nFuzzy dark matter models posit ultralight scalar fields with masses around \\( 10^{-22} \\, \\mathrm{eV} \\), behaving as a coherent quantum wave on galactic scales and suppressing small-scale structure formation through de Broglie wavelength effects. This quantum pressure leads to soliton cores in dark matter halos, resolving the cusp-core problem where cold dark matter simulations predict cuspy profiles mismatched by dwarf galaxy observations. Fuzzy dark matter aligns with large-scale cosmology while altering rotation curves in low-mass systems.\n\nRecent 2025 mirror world models propose a parity-symmetric duplicate sector where dark matter consists of mirror particles interacting with ordinary matter via gravity and portal mechanisms, such as kinetic mixing or Higgs portals. These models employ the Affleck-Dine mechanism to generate comparable baryon and mirror baryon asymmetries, achieving the observed matter-dark matter coincidence without invoking new forces beyond weak portals. Supernova remnant simulations incorporating mirror dark matter with hyperons and portal interactions further constrain portal strengths.\n\n### Exotic and Alternative Candidates\n\nExotic candidates for dark matter encompass a range of non-particle explanations that challenge the standard paradigm by proposing modifications to gravity or alternative astrophysical objects, rather than invoking undetected particles. These approaches aim to account for observed gravitational anomalies without invoking additional matter components, though they often face challenges in explaining phenomena across all scales.\n\nPrimordial black holes (PBHs) represent one such candidate, hypothesized to form from the collapse of large density fluctuations in the early universe shortly after the Big Bang. These black holes could span a broad mass spectrum, from \\(10^{-16}\\) solar masses (comparable to asteroid sizes) up to 10 solar masses, potentially constituting a fraction of the dark matter if produced in sufficient abundance during the inflationary epoch. However, observations of gravitational wave mergers detected by LIGO and Virgo between 2015 and 2025 have imposed stringent limits, constraining the fraction of dark matter in asteroid-mass PBHs to less than 1%, as such events would produce detectable signals if they dominated the dark matter budget.\n\nSelf-interacting dark matter (SIDM) offers a hybrid paradigm where dark matter particles interact via a non-gravitational force, leading to velocity-dependent self-scattering cross-sections per unit mass of approximately \\(\\sigma/m \\approx 1\\) cm²/g. This interaction helps resolve discrepancies like the core-cusp problem, where cold dark matter simulations predict cuspy density profiles in galactic centers, but observations reveal flatter cores; SIDM scattering thermalizes the inner halo, flattening these profiles on dwarf galaxy scales. While not purely non-particle, SIDM modifies standard particle behavior to mimic exotic dynamics without altering gravity itself.\n\nModified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) proposes a fundamental alteration to gravity at low accelerations, replacing the need for dark matter with a modified law where the acceleration \\(a\\) relates to the Newtonian acceleration \\(g_N\\) via \\(a = \\sqrt{a_0 g_N}\\) for \\(a \\ll a_0\\), with the critical scale \\(a_0 \\approx 1.2 \\\times 10^{-10}\\) m/s². This formulation successfully reproduces galactic rotation curves using only visible baryonic matter, eliminating the need for unseen mass to explain flat rotation profiles beyond the optical radius. However, MOND struggles on cluster scales, where lensing and dynamics require additional unseen mass that the theory cannot fully accommodate without ad hoc modifications.\n\nRecent developments in 2025 have further explored gravity-modifying alternatives. A new theoretical equation derived from variable fundamental constants suggests the universe's expansion and structure can be explained without dark matter, attributing gravitational effects to evolving forces rather than missing mass. Complementing this, researchers at the University of Copenhagen have initiated hunts for dark matter signatures using the immense magnetic fields in galaxy clusters to probe conversions of radiation into hypothetical particles, potentially revealing non-standard interactions in intergalactic environments.\n\nEmergent gravity theories, pioneered by Erik Verlinde in 2016, posit that gravity arises as an entropic force from quantum entanglement in the underlying microstructure of spacetime, naturally incorporating dark energy effects without invoking dark matter particles. In this framework, apparent dark matter effects emerge from the entanglement entropy of ordinary matter, providing a thermodynamic basis for modified dynamics. Numerical simulations of emergent gravity in Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetimes have tested these ideas against black hole horizons and cosmological backgrounds, showing consistency with observed acceleration on galactic scales while challenging general relativity's foundations.\n\n## Detection Efforts\n\n### Direct Detection\n\nDirect detection experiments seek to observe dark matter particles, primarily weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), through their elastic scattering off atomic nuclei in ultra-sensitive underground detectors, which minimize cosmic ray interference. These efforts aim to measure the recoil energy of target nuclei, providing signatures of dark matter interactions predicted by models like the standard WIMP paradigm. The cross-section for such interactions is expected to be extremely low, on the order of 10^{-40} cm² or smaller, necessitating detectors with masses exceeding several tonnes and backgrounds reduced to levels below 10^{-6} events per kg per day.\n\nNoble liquid detectors, utilizing liquid xenon or argon as targets, dominate the field due to their scalability and ability to discriminate between nuclear recoils (from dark matter) and electronic recoils (from background radiation) via scintillation and ionization signals. The XENONnT experiment, operational since 2021 with a 1.5-tonne fiducial mass, reported in 2025 new upper limits on spin-independent WIMP-nucleon cross-sections, with a minimum of 1.7 × 10^{-47} cm² at 30 GeV/c² (90% confidence level) based on 3.1 tonne-year exposure. Similarly, the LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) collaboration, with a ~7-tonne xenon target, achieved world-leading sensitivity in 2025, setting a limit of 2.2 × 10^{-48} cm² at 40 GeV/c² (90% CL) from 4.2 tonne-year exposure (280 live days), further constraining low-mass WIMPs down to 6 GeV/c². These results have excluded a significant portion of the parameter space motivated by supersymmetry models.\n\nCryogenic crystal detectors, employing superconducting sensors to measure phonon and ionization signals in materials like germanium or silicon, offer enhanced sensitivity to low-mass dark matter particles by achieving lower energy thresholds, around 1-10 keV. The SuperCDMS SNOLAB experiment, using germanium crystals cooled to millikelvin temperatures, demonstrated in recent runs sensitivity to WIMPs as light as 1 GeV/c², with cross-section limits reaching 10^{-46} cm² for spin-dependent interactions, complementing noble liquid searches by probing lighter candidates inaccessible to xenon-based detectors. This approach leverages the isotope-specific response of germanium to distinguish interaction types.\n\nA notable anomaly in direct detection is the annual modulation signal reported by the DAMA/LIBRA experiment in Italy, which has observed since the 1990s a sinusoidal variation in event rate with a period of one year and amplitude consistent with Earth's orbital motion through a dark matter halo, culminating in a ~12σ significance cumulatively by 2025 after over 20 years of data with a 250 kg NaI(Tl) crystal array. Recent analyses by COSINE-100 and ANAIS-112 (2025) exclude the DAMA signal at 3-4σ levels in model-independent ways, intensifying the debate. This signal, interpreted by the collaboration as evidence for ~10 GeV WIMPs scattering coherently off sodium and iodine nuclei, remains unexplained and unconfirmed by other experiments, which report null results in the same parameter space, highlighting potential systematic issues or novel dark matter properties.\n\nDirectional detection techniques aim to identify the origin of dark matter particles by measuring the head-tail asymmetry in nuclear recoil tracks, providing a smoking-gun signature against isotropic backgrounds. The DRIFT (Directional Recoil Identification From Tracks) experiment, using low-pressure gas time projection chambers with CS₂ or CF₄ targets, has prototyped this method since the early 2000s, achieving 3D track reconstruction with sub-millimeter resolution for recoils up to 100 keV, though full-scale deployment awaits larger detectors. The CYGNUS prototype, exploring similar gaseous detectors with optical readout, focuses on head-tail discrimination for low-mass WIMPs, demonstrating feasibility in lab tests but limited by low event rates in current setups. These approaches could revolutionize detection if scaled up.\n\n### Indirect Detection\n\nIndirect detection of dark matter involves searching for annihilation or decay products, such as gamma rays, cosmic-ray positrons, antiprotons, and neutrinos, originating from high-density regions like the Galactic center or dwarf spheroidal galaxies. These searches target multi-messenger signatures that could distinguish dark matter signals from astrophysical backgrounds, providing complementary constraints to other detection methods. Observations from space-based and ground-based telescopes have yielded stringent limits on dark matter models, particularly for weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) with masses in the GeV to TeV range.\n\nThe Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT), operational since 2008, has conducted extensive searches for gamma-ray signals from dark matter annihilation in dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs), which are dark matter-dominated systems with low astrophysical backgrounds. Analyses of over 14 years of data from multiple dSphs, including combined efforts with other telescopes like HAWC, H.E.S.S., MAGIC, and VERITAS, have revealed no significant excess above expected backgrounds. These null results impose competitive limits on the annihilation cross-section, such as $\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle \\u003c 10^{-25}$ cm³/s for WIMPs around 100 GeV annihilating into $b\\bar{b}$ final states, tightening bounds on thermal relic models.\n\nThe Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer-02 (AMS-02) on the International Space Station has measured an excess of positrons ($e^+$) in the cosmic-ray spectrum up to several hundred GeV, prompting interpretations involving dark matter annihilation. However, detailed spectral analyses and propagation models indicate that this excess is consistent with astrophysical sources, particularly millisecond pulsars injecting electron-positron pairs, rather than a dark matter signal. Antiproton data from AMS-02 further support this, showing no unambiguous excess attributable to dark matter, with pulsar contributions explaining the observed fluxes without invoking new physics.\n\nNeutrino observatories like IceCube have probed dark matter decay or annihilation signals from dense targets, including the Earth's core and nearby stars where dark matter capture could lead to accumulation. A 10-year analysis of muon neutrino events from the Earth's center found no significant excess, setting limits on heavy dark matter lifetimes exceeding $10^{28}$ seconds for masses above 100 GeV. Similar searches for neutrinos from stellar dark matter capture, such as in the Sun or Galactic stars, yield comparable bounds, ruling out substantial contributions from captured WIMPs or other heavy particles.\n\nThe Galactic center gamma-ray excess (GCE), first reported in the 2010s by Fermi-LAT, features an extended source of 1-3 GeV photons toward the Milky Way's core, with a spectrum and morphology that could arise from dark matter annihilation into quarks or other channels. However, ongoing debates highlight astrophysical explanations, such as a population of unresolved millisecond pulsars or cosmic-ray interactions with interstellar gas, as equally viable fits to the data. Recent morphological studies using 15+ years of Fermi-LAT observations reinforce the ambiguity, with no consensus favoring dark matter over these conventional sources.\n\nIn August 2025, researchers proposed using the strong magnetic fields in galaxy clusters to detect intergalactic dark matter signals via photon conversion from distant black holes, potentially revealing light dark matter particles like axions. This method leverages gravitational lensing by clusters to align sightlines, enhancing sensitivity to diffuse signals that evade traditional telescopes, though initial observations remain exploratory.\n\n### Collider Searches\n\nCollider searches for dark matter aim to produce dark matter particles in high-energy proton-proton collisions at facilities like the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), where the primary signature is missing transverse energy (MET) arising from unobserved particles escaping the detector. The ATLAS and CMS experiments exploit this by searching for events where visible particles, such as jets or photons, are balanced by significant MET, indicating the production of invisible particles like weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) that could constitute dark matter. These searches target simplified models where dark matter couples to Standard Model particles via mediators, providing model-independent constraints on production cross-sections.\n\nA prominent channel is the monojet + MET signature, where a single high-energy jet recoils against invisible particles produced via a mediator. ATLAS and CMS analyses of LHC Run 2 data (up to 139 fb⁻¹ at 13 TeV) have set limits on simplified s-channel models, excluding dark matter masses up to approximately 585 GeV for axial-vector mediators and mediator masses up to 2.1 TeV at 95% confidence level. Extending to Run 3 data (as of November 2025, with total integrated luminosity exceeding 300 fb⁻¹), these searches yield upper limits on the product of production cross-section and branching ratio (σ × BR) below 10 fb for mediators around 100 GeV, tightening constraints on light mediator scenarios. No excess over Standard Model backgrounds has been observed, with systematic uncertainties on MET reconstruction controlled to 1–4% across relevant energy scales.\n\nIn Higgs portal models, dark matter interacts via the Higgs boson, potentially leading to invisible decays (H → χχ, where χ is the dark matter particle). Combined ATLAS and CMS searches using Run 2 and early Run 3 data constrain the invisible Higgs branching ratio to below 10.7% at 95% confidence level, with observed limits of 10.7% (expected 7.7%). This bound, derived from vector boson fusion and associated production channels with MET, complements astrophysical constraints by probing Higgs-mediated dark matter production directly at colliders.\n\nRecent analyses of LHC Run 3 data (2022–2025) have yielded null results, excluding light mediators (masses ≲ 100 GeV) in supersymmetric extensions where the lightest supersymmetric particle serves as dark matter. These exclusions arise from monojet and multi-jet + MET channels, with no significant deviations from Standard Model expectations reported across 140–200 fb⁻¹ analyzed.\n\nThe High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC), starting post-2029, is projected to collect up to 3000 fb⁻¹ at 14 TeV, enabling sensitivity to TeV-scale dark matter production in simplified models and SUSY scenarios. Enhanced MET resolution and machine learning techniques are expected to improve exclusion limits by factors of 2–5 for mediator masses up to several TeV, potentially discovering or strongly constraining weakly coupled dark matter.\n\n## Astrophysical Implications\n\n### Structure Formation\n\nIn the cold dark matter (CDM) paradigm, the formation of cosmic structures occurs through a hierarchical merging process, where small-scale density perturbations collapse first to form compact dark matter halos, which then merge over time to assemble larger systems such as galaxies and galaxy clusters. This bottom-up scenario arises from the power spectrum of initial density fluctuations in CDM cosmologies, which favors the growth of small structures early in the universe's history. The statistical distribution of halo masses at any given epoch is predicted by the Press-Schechter formalism, which posits that the comoving number density of halos with mass between $M$ and $M + dM$ follows\n\n$$\n\\frac{dn}{dM} \\propto \\frac{\\rho}{M^2} \\frac{\\delta_c}{\\sigma(M)} \\exp\\left( -\\frac{\\delta_c^2}{\\sigma^2(M)} \\right) dM,\n$$\n\nwhere $\\rho$ is the mean matter density, $\\delta_c \\approx 1.686$ is the critical overdensity for collapse, and $\\sigma(M)$ is the root-mean-square fluctuation amplitude smoothed on the mass scale $M$. This exponential cutoff at high masses reflects the rarity of large fluctuations, while the power-law behavior at low masses captures the abundance of small halos.\n\nDark matter plays a crucial role in seeding the gravitational collapse of baryonic matter via the Jeans instability, where the deep potential wells formed by dark matter concentrations lower the effective Jeans mass for baryons, enabling their perturbations to grow. In the matter-dominated era, these dark matter perturbations $\\delta$ evolve linearly as $\\delta \\propto a$, with the scale factor $a$ increasing, providing a stable framework for baryonic infall and subsequent structure growth. Without dark matter's early dominance, baryonic perturbations would be suppressed by radiation pressure until recombination, delaying galaxy formation.\n\nDark matter decouples from acoustic oscillations in the primordial photon-baryon fluid much earlier than baryons, avoiding the damping effects that limit baryonic structure on small scales. Silk damping, arising from photon diffusion in the tightly coupled plasma before recombination, suppresses baryonic fluctuations below $\\sim 10$ Mpc scales, while baryon loading enhances the odd acoustic peaks in the cosmic microwave background by increasing the sound speed during compression phases. This differential decoupling allows dark matter to cluster freely, imprinting its hierarchical signature on the large-scale structure while baryons settle into the resulting potentials.\n\nNumerical simulations have vividly illustrated this process, revealing the filamentary cosmic web as the dominant morphology of dark matter distribution. The Millennium Simulation (2005), using $10^{10}$ particles in a $500$ Mpc$^3$ volume, demonstrated how initial Gaussian fluctuations evolve into a network of walls, filaments, and voids through hierarchical merging, matching observed galaxy clustering on scales up to $100$ Mpc. More recent hydrodynamical runs in the IllustrisTNG project (2018 onward) incorporate baryonic physics and confirm the prominence of filamentary structures, with dark matter densities peaking along threads connecting massive halos, as seen in volume renderings of the $100$ Mpc TNG100 simulation. In 2025, researchers at Argonne National Laboratory utilized the Aurora exascale supercomputer to perform high-resolution cosmological simulations resolving dark matter substructure down to dwarf galaxy scales, enabling detailed modeling of merger histories and tidal streams in the local universe.\n\n### Dark Matter Halos\n\nDark matter halos are extended, roughly spherical distributions of dark matter that envelop galaxies and galaxy clusters, shaping their gravitational potentials and influencing the motion of visible matter. These halos arise from the gravitational collapse of primordial density fluctuations in the cold dark matter paradigm and are inferred from a variety of astrophysical observations, including galaxy rotation curves and gravitational lensing. Simulations indicate that halos are not smooth but contain complex substructures and density gradients, with their properties scaling predictably with total mass.\n\nA key feature of dark matter halos is their universal density profile, as revealed by high-resolution N-body simulations. The Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile describes this structure analytically, with a cuspy inner region where the density ρ(r) scales as r^{-1} and an outer region falling off as r^{-3}. This form arises from hierarchical clustering and has been confirmed across a wide range of halo masses in cosmological simulations. The profile is parameterized by a scale radius r_s and a characteristic density, or equivalently by the halo virial mass M and the dimensionless concentration parameter c = r_vir / r_s, where r_vir is the virial radius.\n\nThe concentration-mass relation provides insight into halo assembly, showing that c decreases weakly with increasing halo mass, approximately as c ∝ M^{-0.1}, such that lower-mass halos are more centrally concentrated. This trend reflects the earlier formation times of smaller halos in the Lambda cold dark matter model. Halos also exhibit rich substructure, with N-body simulations predicting thousands of satellite subhalos capable of hosting dwarf galaxies around a Milky Way-like system. However, observations detect only about 50 such satellites, posing the missing satellites problem and suggesting possible suppression mechanisms like baryonic feedback or warm dark matter.\n\nDisrupting satellite galaxies contribute to halo complexity through tidal interactions, producing streams of stars and dark matter that trace the gravitational potential. Simulations of the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy's infall and disruption successfully reproduce observed tidal streams in the Milky Way, such as bifurcated features wrapping around the halo, thereby constraining the triaxial shape and lumpiness of the local dark matter distribution. Recent analyses using 2025 Gaia data release measurements of stellar kinematics have refined estimates of the local dark matter halo density to ρ_0 = 0.44 ± 0.13 GeV cm^{-3} near the Sun, consistent with NFW predictions and aiding direct detection experiments. These halos also play a role in strong gravitational lensing by magnifying background sources through their mass distributions.\n\n### Dense Dark Matter Objects\n\nDense dark matter objects refer to compact, high-density structures that may form through the aggregation and gravitational binding of dark matter particles, distinct from extended halos. These objects arise in various theoretical models of particle dark matter, potentially influencing early universe evolution, galactic dynamics, and observable phenomena like microlensing. Examples include self-gravitating configurations powered by annihilation or interactions, as well as dense cores shaped by self-interactions or external influences from black holes.\n\nDark stars represent hypothetical compact objects in the early universe, formed when weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) accumulate in primordial gas clouds and power the structure through annihilation heating, preventing full collapse into nuclear-burning stars. These objects can reach masses between 1 and 1000 solar masses (M$_\\sun$), with the heating from WIMP annihilation maintaining a hydrostatic equilibrium and stalling further contraction for timescales of thousands of years. In models, dark stars form within dark matter minihalos of about 10$^6$ M$_\\sun$ at redshifts around $z=20$, achieving central dark matter densities up to 10$^{12}$ GeV/cm$^3$. Recent observations by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have identified candidates such as JADES-GS-z13-0 at $z \\approx 13$, with inferred masses around 10$^6$ M$_\\sun$ and luminosities up to 10$^{10}$ L$_\\sun$, consistent with supermassive dark star properties powered by dark matter heating rather than fusion.\n\nBoson stars emerge as soliton-like configurations from ultralight scalar fields, such as axions, where quantum pressure from the scalar field's de Broglie wavelength balances gravity to form stable, compact objects without collapsing into black holes. These structures, with masses potentially in the range of 10$^{-12}$ to 10$^2$ M$_\\sun$ depending on the boson mass (around 10$^{-10}$ eV), serve as extended dark matter candidates that could comprise a fraction of galactic halos. As microlensing candidates, boson stars produce distinctive light curves due to their finite size, differing from point-mass lenses like primordial black holes; machine learning analyses of such events suggest they could explain excess microlensing signals without requiring compact baryonic objects.\n\nIn self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) models, dense cores form in dwarf galaxies through gravothermal collapse, where repeated scattering thermalizes the dark matter and leads to central density enhancements on kiloparsec scales, resolving the cusp-core problem of cold dark matter simulations. These cores, with sizes around 1 kpc and densities increasing over cosmic time, exhibit greater diversity in stellar properties like velocity dispersion compared to non-interacting models, as seen in hydrodynamical simulations of 10$^{10}$ M$_\\sun$ halos. A two-component SIDM framework with mass segregation further predicts growing cores that align with observed dwarf galaxy clustering and strong lensing excesses, while satisfying cluster-scale constraints.\n\nInteractions between supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and dark matter in galactic centers involve accretion of dark matter onto the black hole and dynamical friction that influences orbital decay. In SIDM scenarios, dark matter forms stable spikes around SMBHs, with accretion rates scaling linearly with the interaction cross-section per unit mass (up to $\\sigma/m_\\chi \\sim 1$ cm$^2$/g) in regimes where the mean free path exceeds the innermost stable orbit, potentially enhancing black hole growth. Dynamical friction from self-interacting dark matter in these spikes extracts angular momentum from SMBH binaries, resolving the \"final parsec problem\" by enabling mergers within 0.1–1 Gyr, unlike collisionless dark matter which disrupts the friction mechanism.\n\nRecent 2025 studies highlight primordial black hole (PBH) clustering within dark matter halos, where initial overdensities lead to dense aggregates that undergo runaway mergers, altering the expected gravitational wave signals. In clustered PBH populations, gravitational perturbations disrupt soft binaries and extend merger timescales, producing a distinct spectral slope in the stochastic gravitational wave background detectable by future observatories like LISA. These mergers in halo substructures could contribute to ultradense dark matter concentrations accompanying PBHs, with implications for early black hole seed formation.\n\n## Cultural and Societal Aspects\n\n### Representations in Popular Culture\n\nDark matter's elusive nature has captivated creators across popular culture, frequently serving as a metaphor for the unknown forces shaping the cosmos and human fate. In science fiction, it often transcends its scientific role as invisible gravitational scaffolding, becoming a plot device for advanced technologies, alternate realities, or existential threats.\n\nIn film and television, dark matter enables speculative phenomena tied to space exploration and alien intelligence. The 2014 film *Interstellar* portrays wormholes as traversable gateways potentially stabilized by exotic forms of matter, enabling interstellar travel amid a dying Earth. Similarly, the 2024 Netflix series *3 Body Problem*, adapted from Liu Cixin's novel, incorporates depictions of cutting-edge physics and extraterrestrial engineering, underscoring the Trisolarans' advanced manipulations of cosmic forces threatening humanity.\n\nLiterature has long used dark matter to envision post-human societies and galactic engineering. In Robert Reed's 2003 novel *Sister Alice*, advanced humans harness dark matter to construct vast, invisible megastructures and augmentations, exploring themes of immortality and cosmic hubris in a far-future galaxy. Greg Egan's 2008 novel *Incandescence* delves into civilizations within the dense galactic bulge, where dark matter's gravitational influence implicitly scaffolds the extreme environments inhabited by insectoid species discovering general relativity.\n\nVideo games and interactive media evoke dark matter as both resource and cosmic mystery. *No Man's Sky* (2016) features dark matter as a rare, toxic curiosity—an Atlas Seed remnant from a collapsed universe—used in crafting and symbolizing the procedural generation of galaxies built on unseen dark scaffolds. In contrast, Nintendo's Kirby series personifies dark matter as a parasitic, collective entity that invades worlds, possesses beings, and unleashes destruction, as seen in *Kirby 3* (1997) where it manifests as a storm cloud seeking to consume Planet Popstar.\n\nArtistic interpretations blend scientific visualization with creative speculation, particularly in 2025 exhibits. NASA's Hubble and James Webb Space Telescope images mapping dark matter distributions through gravitational lensing have inspired immersive installations, such as the \"Sensing Dark Matter\" exhibition at Melbourne's Science Gallery, where participants experienced simulated interactions with dark matter particles to probe its sensory implications. These works highlight dark matter's role in structure formation while inviting reflection on humanity's perceptual limits.\n\nPopular depictions often introduce misconceptions by attributing agency or malice to dark matter, diverging from its scientifically inferred passivity as non-luminous, non-interacting particles comprising about 27% of the universe's mass-energy. For example, while Kirby's sentient Dark Matter embodies evil conquest, real dark matter exerts influence solely through gravity, without electromagnetic interactions or consciousness.\n\nRecent scientific progress has fueled cultural resurgence. An October 2025 Reuters report on advancements toward direct dark matter detection, including potential operations of new experiments by 2026, has spurred popular science literature and media, emphasizing its gravitational detectability and inspiring narratives of impending cosmic revelation.\n\n### Open Questions and Debates\n\nOne of the persistent challenges in dark matter research is the \"small-scale crisis\" within the cold dark matter (CDM) paradigm, which predicts structures that do not fully align with observations on galactic and sub-galactic scales. The core-cusp problem arises because CDM simulations forecast cuspy density profiles—steeply rising toward the center—in low-mass dark matter halos, whereas observations of dwarf and low-surface-brightness galaxies reveal flatter, cored profiles with lower central densities. Similarly, the missing satellites problem highlights a discrepancy in the Local Group, where the observed number of dwarf satellite galaxies is significantly fewer than the thousands of low-mass subhalos (\\u003c10¹¹ M⊙) predicted by CDM within comparable volumes. The too-big-to-fail problem compounds this by noting that the most massive subhalos expected around Milky Way-like galaxies should host bright satellites, yet such luminous counterparts are absent, suggesting these structures are either overpredicted or altered by unobserved processes. These issues, while potentially mitigated by baryonic feedback in simulations, remain debated as they question the universality of CDM on small scales.\n\nA central debate concerns the fundamental nature of dark matter itself: whether it consists of undetected particles or if gravitational laws require modification on galactic scales, as in Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND). An October 2025 report highlighted advancements in direct detection experiments, with potential new operations by 2026, underscoring ongoing efforts to distinguish between particle-based models like weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) and alternatives such as MOND, originally proposed to account for flat rotation curves without invisible mass.\n\nCompounding these challenges is the diversity problem observed in ultrafaint dwarf galaxies, which exhibit a wide range of rotation curve shapes and stellar distributions despite similar dark matter halo masses, defying the uniformity expected in CDM simulations. These galaxies, among the least massive and most dark matter-dominated systems, show deviations from cuspy profiles, with some displaying cores that require invoking varied baryonic feedback mechanisms—such as supernova-driven outflows or radiative cooling—to sculpt diverse density structures. However, standard hydrodynamic simulations demand fine-tuned feedback parameters to reproduce this variability, leading to debates over whether such ad hoc adjustments undermine CDM's predictive power or if alternative dark matter profiles, like those in DARKexp theory, better explain the observations without relying on feedback. Recent analyses of the SPARC catalog and ultrafaint dwarfs suggest that collisionless cold dark matter models can address this diversity through intrinsic profile variations, but the need for galaxy-specific feedback models persists as an open question.\n\nPhilosophically, the prolonged non-detection of dark matter particles raises profound questions about whether it signals groundbreaking new physics beyond the Standard Model or merely gaps in our observational capabilities and theoretical priors. Proponents of scientific realism argue that dark matter's explanatory unification—linking phenomena from galactic rotations to cosmic microwave background anisotropies—justifies continued belief despite null results from over three decades of experiments, emphasizing historical continuity in astronomical inferences of unseen mass. Critics, invoking underdetermination, contend that evidence like the Bullet Cluster's gravitational lensing favors dark matter only when Bayesian priors are biased toward particle models, whereas modified gravity theories like MOND equally fit data such as rotation curves without invoking undetected entities, potentially rendering dark matter a \"god of the gaps\" placeholder. If direct detection remains elusive, this could compel a paradigm shift toward gravity modifications, though such alternatives struggle with large-scale cosmology, highlighting the interplay between empirical evidence and philosophical commitments to theoretical simplicity.\n\nIn broader cosmological contexts, dark matter's role intersects with multiverse theories arising from eternal inflation, where ongoing inflationary processes in a false vacuum perpetually generate bubble universes with potentially varying physical constants and dark matter densities. Eternal inflation models predict an infinite multiverse beyond our observable horizon, complicating dark matter predictions as different domains may host diverse particle species or abundances, with our observed density (Ω_dm ≈ 0.26) emerging from selection effects in this ensemble. This framework amplifies debates on testability, as the measure problem—assigning probabilities across infinite regions—underdetermines dark matter's nature, suggesting that non-detection might reflect our universe's atypicality rather than fundamental absence.\n\nRecent results from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) in 2025 have intensified scrutiny of the ΛCDM model, hinting at evolving dark energy that undermines the paradigm's assumption of a constant cosmological term. DESI's second data release (DR2), analyzing baryon acoustic oscillations from galaxies, quasars, and the Lyman-alpha forest, provides evidence for a time-varying dark energy equation of state w(z), particularly at low redshifts (z \\u003c 0.3), with tensions up to 4.2σ against ΛCDM when combined with supernova and cosmic microwave background data. These findings, favoring dynamic models over a static Λ, question the totality of ΛCDM—including its cold dark matter component—and suggest interconnected new physics, such as evolving neutrino masses or modified gravity, to reconcile discrepancies. While not conclusive, the 3.1σ exclusion from DESI+CMB alone underscores the need for further observations to determine if dark matter's framework requires revision.",
