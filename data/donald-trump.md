# Donald Trump

Donald John Trump (born June 14, 1946, in Queens, New York, U.S.) is an American politician, real estate developer, and media personality affiliated with the Republican Party. He has served as the 47th president of the United States since January 20, 2025, in his second non-consecutive term, and previously as the 45th president from January 20, 2017, to January 20, 2021. Trump assumed leadership of his family's real estate business in 1971, expanding it into luxury properties, hotels, casinos, golf courses, and branding ventures. He rose to prominence as a media figure through authorship and television, including hosting *The Apprentice*. After earlier exploratory presidential bids, Trump secured the Republican nomination in 2016, won the presidency as a political outsider, lost reelection in 2020, and reclaimed the office in 2024.
## Early life

### Family background and upbringing

Donald Trump was born on **June 14, 1946**, at Jamaica Hospital in the Queens borough of New York City. His father, Frederick Christ Trump (1905–1999), was a New York-born real estate developer whose parents had immigrated from Germany; Fred built a substantial business constructing and managing middle-class rental housing in Brooklyn and Queens, amassing a fortune estimated at over $250 million by the time of his death. Trump's mother, Mary Anne MacLeod (1912–2000), was born on the Scottish island of Lewis to a Gaelic-speaking fisherman and crofter; she immigrated to the United States in 1930 at age 18, initially working as a domestic servant before marrying Fred Trump in 1936 and becoming a U.S. citizen in 1942. 

The couple raised five children in an affluent, exclusively residential enclave called Jamaica Estates in Queens, where the family occupied a Tudor Revival-style home at 85-15 Wareham Place that Fred Trump had built; the neighborhood featured spacious lots, stone pillars at entrances, and homes set back from tree-lined streets, insulating residents from the denser urban fabric of New York.  Trump was the fourth child, with older siblings Maryanne (born 1937), Fred Jr. (born 1938), and Elizabeth (born 1942), and a younger brother Robert (born 1948). The family's wealth derived primarily from Fred's real estate operations, which emphasized efficient construction, tenant management, and government-subsidized housing projects, instilling in his children values of discipline and business acumen; Trump later credited his father with teaching him the fundamentals of deal-making and property development from a young age.

Fred Trump Jr., initially groomed to succeed in the family business, instead pursued aviation and became a TWA pilot but struggled with alcoholism, dying at age 42 in 1981 from a heart attack related to the condition; this experience profoundly influenced Trump, who has abstained from alcohol and attributed his own avoidance of substances to witnessing his brother's decline.  Mary Anne Trump focused on homemaking and later philanthropy, supporting causes like the Salvation Army and Scottish heritage groups, while maintaining a low public profile despite the family's prominence in local real estate circles. The parents' marriage lasted 63 years until Fred's death, marked by a stable but demanding household environment where Fred enforced high expectations, often involving his children in business tasks during summers. 

### Education and early career influences

Trump attended the **New York Military Academy** (NYMA), a private boarding school in upstate New York, from 1959 to 1964, after his parents enrolled him there at age 13 to address disciplinary concerns at his prior school. He graduated from NYMA in May 1964 as a captain of the cadet corps, an experience he later credited with instilling structure and leadership skills.

Trump enrolled at **Fordham University** in the Bronx for two years, from 1964 to 1966, before transferring to the **Wharton School** of the University of Pennsylvania. At Wharton, he pursued studies in economics with a focus on real estate, graduating in May 1968 with a Bachelor of Science degree. His academic record at Wharton remains undisclosed, though he has described the program as rigorous and emphasized its selectivity.

Upon graduation, Trump returned to New York to work full-time in his father Fred Trump's real estate firm, then known as Elizabeth Trump \u0026 Son, which specialized in constructing and managing middle-class apartment complexes in Brooklyn and Queens using federally insured loans. Fred Trump, who had amassed a fortune through high-volume development of over 27,000 units by the 1960s, served as the primary early career influence, teaching his son operational efficiencies, cost controls, and the benefits of government subsidies for housing projects. During college summers and post-graduation, Trump apprenticed in the business, handling tasks from site supervision to financial negotiations, which honed his practical understanding of urban development amid New York's postwar housing boom.

In 1971, at age 24, Trump assumed the presidency of the company, renaming it the Trump Organization and redirecting efforts toward luxury developments in Manhattan, building on his father's foundation of scalable, subsidized real estate but adapting it to higher-end markets. This transition reflected Fred Trump's guidance on leveraging family capital— including an initial $1 million loan Donald has described as modest—while navigating regulatory and zoning challenges inherent to New York real estate. The firm's early practices, scrutinized in a 1973 U.S. Department of Justice lawsuit alleging racial discrimination in tenant screening (which the Trumps settled without admitting wrongdoing), underscored the competitive, compliance-driven environment shaping Trump's initial professional ethos.

## Business career

### Real estate development

In 1971, Donald Trump assumed leadership of his father Fred Trump's real estate business, Elizabeth Trump \u0026 Son, which primarily developed and managed middle-class rental apartments in Brooklyn and Queens. He renamed the company the Trump Organization around 1973 and redirected its focus toward high-end commercial and residential developments in Manhattan, capitalizing on the city's revitalization amid economic challenges. This shift involved leveraging family resources, including loans from Fred Trump, and pursuing aggressive financing strategies to acquire distressed properties.

Trump's breakthrough project was the renovation of the Commodore Hotel near Grand Central Terminal. In 1976, he partnered with the Hyatt Corporation to purchase the dilapidated property, securing a 40-year tax abatement from New York City valued at hundreds of millions over its term, which offset renovation costs exceeding $100 million. The hotel reopened as the Grand Hyatt in 1980 after a four-year overhaul that introduced a signature mirrored glass facade and stainless steel accents, transforming it into a profitable luxury venue and establishing Trump's reputation for urban renewal. This deal exemplified his reliance on government incentives, including urban development tax breaks, to rehabilitate underutilized assets in declining areas.

A subsequent landmark was Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue. In 1979, Trump acquired the Bonwit Teller department store site for $15 million, demolishing the building despite preservation concerns over its Art Deco elements, to construct a 58-story mixed-use skyscraper with retail, offices, and condominiums. Construction, designed by architect Der Scutt, incorporated air rights purchases to exceed zoning height limits, and the tower opened in 1983 as a symbol of 1980s opulence, housing Trump's personal triplex penthouse and generating substantial leasing revenue from tenants like luxury retailers. The project benefited from additional tax abatements and highlighted Trump's strategy of branding developments with his name to attract high-profile occupancy.

Throughout the 1980s, Trump expanded with projects like the 1984 acquisition of the West Side Rail Yards, redeveloped into the 16-building Trump Place residential complex along the Hudson River, involving complex zoning battles and public-private partnerships. He also pursued office towers, such as the 1995 purchase of 40 Wall Street for $1.3 million during a market downturn, renaming it the Trump Building and investing in renovations to revive its occupancy amid financial district competition. These ventures underscored a pattern of opportunistic buys, debt-financed growth, and utilization of eminent domain and subsidies, though they occasionally drew criticism for prioritizing profit over historical preservation. By the late 1980s, Trump's Manhattan portfolio had elevated the family firm from suburban rentals to iconic luxury assets, amassing an estimated empire valued in the billions before subsequent economic pressures.

### Diversification into casinos, branding, and other ventures

In the mid-1980s, Trump expanded beyond real estate into the casino industry, capitalizing on New Jersey's legalization of gambling in Atlantic City. He opened Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino on May 15, 1984, at a construction cost of $210 million, marking his first gaming venture and the city's tenth casino. This was followed by Trump Castle (later renamed Trump Marina) on June 19, 1985. In 1990, Trump launched the Trump Taj Mahal, which opened on April 2 at a cost of nearly $1 billion and was promoted as the world's largest and most opulent casino, featuring extensive marble, gold accents, and entertainment amenities.

Trump also ventured into professional sports ownership, acquiring the New Jersey Generals franchise in the United States Football League (USFL) on September 22, 1983, for under $10 million. The team played from 1983 to 1985, during which Trump advocated for the league to challenge the NFL through antitrust litigation and a proposed shift to a fall schedule, though the USFL ultimately folded after a 1986 court ruling awarded only nominal damages.

In aviation, Trump purchased Eastern Air Lines' shuttle service between New York, Boston, and Washington, D.C., on October 12, 1988, for $365 million in cash, rebranding it as Trump Shuttle with upgraded interiors including mahogany paneling and gold fixtures. The operation flew until 1992, when high fuel costs and debt led to its sale to USAir.

Parallel to these capital-intensive projects, Trump developed a branding model in the 1980s by licensing his surname to third-party developers and manufacturers, generating revenue through fees or revenue shares without direct ownership or operational involvement. This approach extended to hotels, residential properties, and consumer goods, with the Trump Organization reporting $215 million in global licensed product sales by 2009, though early deals in the 1980s laid the foundation for this passive income stream.

### Financial setbacks, bankruptcies, and recoveries

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Trump's casino ventures in Atlantic City faced severe financial strain due to aggressive expansion financed by high-interest junk bonds and overleveraged debt amid a recession and declining gambling revenue. By 1990, his businesses carried approximately $3.4 billion in total debt, with Trump personally guaranteeing about $832.5 million, primarily tied to properties like the Trump Taj Mahal, which opened in April 1990 as the world's largest casino-hotel but filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in July 1991 after accumulating $820 million in debt from junk bonds yielding 14% interest. This filing allowed restructuring, reducing bondholder claims by about 50% in exchange for equity stakes, while Trump surrendered personal guarantees on much of the debt but retained operational control through negotiated terms with lenders.

Subsequent filings followed in 1992 for Trump Plaza Hotel (March) and Trump Plaza Casino and Trump Castle Hotel and Casino (both in 1992), driven by similar cash flow shortfalls and totaling over $1.5 billion in liabilities across the entities. These Chapter 11 proceedings, which Trump described as strategic tools for renegotiating unfavorable terms rather than admissions of total failure, enabled debt-for-equity swaps and extensions, averting liquidation and preserving the brands' viability. Notably, none involved personal bankruptcy for Trump, as the filings were corporate and shielded his core real estate holdings outside Atlantic City.

Later setbacks occurred with the publicly traded Trump Hotels \u0026 Casino Resorts, which filed for Chapter 11 in November 2004 amid $1.8 billion in debt and operating losses from competition and post-9/11 tourism declines; Trump reduced his ownership from 47% to 27% post-restructuring. The entity refiled in 2009 during the financial crisis, with Trump resigning as chairman but securing a $100 million equity stake in the reorganized Trump Entertainment Resorts. A final filing came in 2014 for the remaining casino operations, after which Trump distanced himself from ownership.

Recoveries stemmed from leveraging Chapter 11 to shed burdensome debt—estimated at over $1 billion in losses carried forward from 1985–1994—while shifting toward low-risk branding and licensing, which generated fees without operational liabilities. Banks provided a 1990 bailout package exceeding $65 million in concessions and new financing to protect their investments, enabling Trump to stabilize core assets like Trump Tower. By the mid-1990s, he pivoted to real estate licensing deals worldwide and media ventures, rebuilding net worth to Forbes' estimated $2.7 billion by 2011 through diversified income streams averaging $200–450 million annually in later disclosures. However, according to tax returns released by the House Ways and Means Committee, Trump paid only $750 in federal income taxes in both 2016 and 2017, and none in 10 of the previous 15 years, largely due to significant business losses offsetting reported income. This approach, emphasizing asset liquidity and selective borrowing, allowed sustained operations despite casino exits, with no further major filings after 2014.
## Media and public persona

### Authorship and self-promotion

Trump has credited himself as the author of multiple books focused on business strategies, personal success, and political views, though most were produced with significant contributions from ghostwriters or co-authors who conducted research, drafted content, and shaped narratives based on his input. These publications have functioned as extensions of his branding efforts, portraying him as an authoritative figure in deal-making and resilience, thereby amplifying his public image beyond real estate ventures.

His most influential book, *The Art of the Deal*, appeared in July 1987 from Random House, co-credited to Trump and journalist Tony Schwartz, and quickly reached number one on the *New York Times* bestseller list, with sales exceeding one million copies by 2016. The volume details Trump's real estate tactics, negotiation principles like "think big" and "protect the downside," and anecdotes of high-stakes deals, which Schwartz described as largely fabricated or exaggerated to fit a promotional mold during 18 months of shadowing and interviewing Trump. Schwartz, who split a $500,000 advance and subsequent royalties 50-50—netting him approximately $1.6 million over time—later asserted in 2016 that he composed nearly all the text, viewing it as a work of "fiction" that burnished Trump's persona as a self-made tycoon, a claim Trump contested through legal threats demanding repayment of shared earnings.

Follow-up titles reinforced this self-promotional theme, often timed to coincide with career milestones or challenges. *Surviving at the Top*, published in 1990 by Random House with assistance from Charles Leerhsen, addressed maintaining success amid scrutiny. *Trump: The Art of the Comeback* (1997, Times Books), again with Leerhsen, chronicled recoveries from financial difficulties, emphasizing adaptability and bold risks. Later works included *Think Big and Kick Ass in Business and Life* (2007, HarperCollins) co-authored with Bill Zanker, promoting aggressive entrepreneurship, and *Time to Get Tough: Making America #1 Again* (2011, Regnery Publishing), a political manifesto critiquing Obama-era policies. These books, typically involving collaborative writing processes where Trump supplied anecdotes and approval rather than primary composition, aligned with his broader strategy of leveraging media and personal narrative to license his name across products and ventures, solidifying a brand synonymous with winning and defiance.

### Television career and The Apprentice

Trump's television career gained prominence in the early 2000s, building on earlier media exposure from his real estate ventures, including guest spots on shows like *Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous* in the 1980s and cameos in films such as *Home Alone 2: Lost in New York* (1992). He appeared in wrestling events, such as being body-slammed by wrestlers on WWF programming in the late 1980s and early 2000s, which enhanced his celebrity status but did not constitute a sustained TV role. Prior to reality television, Trump's on-screen presence was episodic, often tied to self-promotion rather than hosting or producing commitments.

The breakthrough came with *The Apprentice*, which premiered on NBC on January 8, 2004, created by producer Mark Burnett and featuring Trump as host and executive producer. The show pitted business contestants against each other in tasks for a chance to win a one-year contract as an apprentice in the Trump Organization, with Trump delivering the iconic "You're fired" dismissal in boardroom scenes. The first season averaged 20.7 million viewers weekly, ranking seventh in Nielsen ratings, while the finale drew an estimated 41.5 million viewers, second only to the Super Bowl that year. Subsequent seasons maintained strong viewership initially, with the series spanning 15 iterations through 2017, though ratings declined over time.

In 2008, NBC launched *The Celebrity Apprentice*, a spin-off format enlisting celebrities for charity-driven competitions under Trump's oversight, which aired until 2015 with Trump as host for most seasons. This version achieved comparable early success, including high ratings and positive reviews, further embedding Trump's authoritative persona in popular culture. Trump co-produced both series through Trump Productions, earning licensing fees and royalties that contributed to his branding revenue, reported at $427.4 million from 2004 to 2018 via tie-in products and media deals.

The programs rehabilitated Trump's public image post-1990s bankruptcies by portraying him as a decisive, ultra-wealthy dealmaker, a narrative emphasized in editing despite behind-the-scenes financial realities. Research indicates exposure to *The Apprentice* correlated with increased voter support for Trump in the 2016 Republican primaries, particularly in areas with higher viewership, suggesting it cultivated perceptions of business acumen transferable to politics. Critics, including former producer Bill Pruitt, have alleged off-camera remarks by Trump, such as use of racial slurs during production discussions, though these claims emerged post-NDA expiration in 2024 without contemporaneous corroboration. The series' format prioritized dramatic firings over substantive business education, aligning with reality TV conventions rather than mirroring Trump's actual corporate operations.

Prior to *The Apprentice*, Donald Trump made several cameo appearances on television shows, typically playing himself as a prominent real estate figure, and in the 1992 film *Home Alone 2: Lost in New York*. His earliest documented TV role occurred in a 1985 episode of *The Jeffersons*, where he advised characters on wealth-building. Additional cameos included episodes of *Sex and the City* in 1998, *The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air* in 1990, and *The Nanny* in 1995, which increased his visibility in popular culture during the 1980s and 1990s. These appearances capitalized on his public persona from real estate deals and media coverage but did not yet establish him as a central TV personality.

## Political emergence

### Pre-2016 political positions and considerations

Trump registered as a Republican in Manhattan in August 1987 after previously identifying with the party, but switched to Democrat shortly thereafter and remained affiliated until September 1999. He then joined the Reform Party until February 2001, rejoined the Democrats until September 2009, became Republican again until August 2011, registered as unaffiliated until 2012, and has been Republican since. These shifts aligned with his business operations in Democrat-leaning New York, where he donated to politicians across parties to secure favorable policies, such as tax abatements for developments. From 1989 to 2010, Trump's contributions exceeded $1.3 million, netting $175,860 more to Democrats than Republicans, including to figures like Hillary Clinton ($4,300 in 2007) and Chuck Schumer; post-2010, Republican recipients predominated.

Trump floated presidential ambitions as early as 1987, placing full-page ads in newspapers like *The New York Times* on September 2, 1987, criticizing U.S. defense spending and alliances, which sparked speculation about a 1988 run that he did not pursue. In October 1999, he formed an exploratory committee for the 2000 Reform Party nomination, appearing on *Larry King Live* to announce it and campaigning briefly in states like Florida and California before withdrawing in February 2000, citing party disarray under Ross Perot's influence. For 2012, Trump engaged in media speculation and meetings with Republican donors in 2011, promoting the Obama birther theory to question eligibility, but declined to run, endorsing Mitt Romney in May 2012 after Romney secured the nomination. These episodes tested public appetite without full commitment, often leveraging his celebrity for publicity.

Trump's issue positions evolved over decades, reflecting adaptations to political contexts. In his 2000 book *The America We Deserve*, he described himself as "very pro-choice" while opposing partial-birth abortion and supporting parental notification, contrasting later stances; by 2011, he identified as pro-life, crediting personal reflection. On guns, the book endorsed the 1994 assault weapons ban and background checks, but by 2015 he advocated Second Amendment absolutism and opposed restrictions. Tax policy in 2000 included a one-time 14.25% levy on net worth over $10 million to reduce debt, alongside flat tax advocacy; pre-2016, he shifted to broad cuts, criticizing high rates on businesses. Immigration views showed continuity in opposing illegal entry—labeling it a "serious problem" in the 2000 book and calling for border enforcement—but early support for pathways for some undocumented workers waned by 2015 toward stricter measures. Foreign policy critiques, like skepticism of endless wars and free trade deficits, persisted from 1987 ads through 2000 writings. These changes drew accusations of opportunism from critics, though Trump attributed them to evolving convictions amid national decline.

### 2016 presidential campaign and election

Trump formally announced his candidacy for the Republican Party's presidential nomination on June 16, 2015, at Trump Tower in New York City, emphasizing themes of American economic decline, unfair trade agreements like NAFTA, and illegal immigration as central to his platform. His campaign adopted the slogan "Make America Great Again," a phrase trademarked by Trump in 2012 and evoking national restoration through policies such as building a border wall with Mexico (which he insisted would be financed by Mexico), renegotiating trade deals, and reducing regulatory burdens. Trump positioned himself as an anti-establishment outsider, criticizing both Republican and Democratic elites for contributing to job losses and national security vulnerabilities.

In the Republican primaries, Trump entered as a political novice facing a crowded field of 16 major candidates, including senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, former governors Jeb Bush and Scott Walker, and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson. He secured early momentum by winning the New Hampshire primary on February 9, 2016, with 35.3% of the vote, followed by victories in South Carolina on February 20 (32.5%) and seven states on Super Tuesday, March 1, including Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Massachusetts, Tennessee, Vermont, and Virginia. Despite losses in Iowa (where Cruz won on February 1) and initial establishment resistance, Trump's rallies drew large crowds, and his direct rhetoric on issues like opposition to political correctness and vows to "drain the swamp" resonated with working-class voters disillusioned by globalization. During a November 2015 rally, Trump drew criticism for appearing to mock New York Times reporter Serge Kovaleski's physical disability while disputing his reporting. Trump denied the accusation, stating he was merely imitating a flustered reporter and was unaware of Kovaleski's condition. By April 26, 2016, after sweeping the Acela Corridor primaries (Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island), Trump had amassed a delegate lead that became insurmountable; he clinched the nomination on May 26 following his Indiana primary win, prompting rivals to suspend campaigns. Trump ultimately secured 1,441 delegates, exceeding the 1,237 needed, with his support base skewing toward non-college-educated voters and those prioritizing immigration restriction.

At the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio, from July 18 to 21, 2016, Trump accepted the nomination on July 21, selecting Indiana Governor Mike Pence as his running mate on July 14 to bolster appeal among evangelical and Midwestern conservatives. The platform endorsed Trump's core pledges, including a border wall, energy independence via expanded drilling, repeal of the Affordable Care Act, and withdrawal from the Paris climate accord. Transitioning to the general election against Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, Trump's campaign emphasized rust-belt economic grievances, criticizing Clinton's tenure as secretary of state for foreign policy failures like the rise of ISIS and the Benghazi attack.

The general election campaign featured three debates on September 26, October 9, and October 19, 2016, where Trump highlighted Clinton's email scandal and pay-to-play allegations at the Clinton Foundation, while facing scrutiny over his tax returns and business dealings. A pivotal controversy arose on October 7 with the release of the Access Hollywood tape, in which Trump made crude remarks about women in 2005, prompting widespread condemnation and some Republican defections, though he apologized and framed it as "locker room talk" without derailing his momentum. On November 8, 2016, Trump won the presidency with 304 electoral votes to Clinton's 227, flipping key Rust Belt states including Michigan (16,704-vote margin), Pennsylvania (44,292), and Wisconsin (22,748), despite losing the popular vote by 2.1 percentage points (62,984,828 votes or 46.1% to Clinton's 65,853,514 or 48.2%). Voter turnout was 55.7% of eligible voters, with Trump's victory attributed to higher margins among white working-class voters without college degrees, who favored him by 39 points nationally. The outcome marked the fifth time in U.S. history a candidate won the electoral college while losing the popular vote, reflecting geographic concentration of support in rural and exurban areas over urban centers.
## First presidency (2017–2021)

### Administration and key appointments

Trump's administration featured a high rate of turnover among senior officials, with 92% of the most influential "A Team" positions changing by January 20, 2021, exceeding the full first-term turnover of his five immediate predecessors. This instability was evident from the first year, when 34% of top aides departed, resigned, or shifted roles, a record for that period. Key factors included policy clashes, public scandals, and Trump's preference for personal loyalty, leading to frequent dismissals or voluntary exits among figures like National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, who resigned after 24 days amid Russia investigation scrutiny, and Chief Strategist Steve Bannon, who departed after seven months following internal power struggles.

The Cabinet comprised Vice President Mike Pence and heads of 15 executive departments, with initial nominees drawn largely from business, military, and conservative political circles rather than career bureaucrats. Confirmations occurred swiftly post-inauguration, with Senate approvals for most by early 2017; for instance, Secretary of Defense James Mattis was confirmed on January 20, 2017, after a waiver for his recent active-duty status. Notable early appointees included Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, a former ExxonMobil CEO confirmed February 2, 2017, who served until March 2018 amid reported tensions over foreign policy autonomy; he was replaced by CIA Director Mike Pompeo, confirmed April 26, 2018. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, confirmed February 8, 2017, recused himself from Russia probes, prompting his firing in November 2018 and leading to a series of acting officials before William Barr's confirmation in February 2019.

White House staffing reflected Trump's outsider approach, with family members like son-in-law Jared Kushner and daughter Ivanka Trump serving in senior advisory roles without Senate confirmation; Kushner oversaw Middle East policy and opioid initiatives. Chiefs of Staff cycled rapidly: Reince Priebus lasted six months until July 2017, succeeded by John Kelly (July 2017 to January 2019), Mick Mulvaney as acting chief (2019-2020), and Mark Meadows (2020-2021). Defense leadership saw Mattis resign in December 2018 over Syria troop withdrawal disagreements, followed by Patrick Shanahan (acting, 2019) and Mark Esper (confirmed July 2019, fired November 2020).

Judicial appointments formed a cornerstone of the administration, with 234 Article III judges confirmed, including three Supreme Court justices reshaping the Court's conservative majority. Neil Gorsuch was nominated January 31, 2017, to fill Antonin Scalia's seat and confirmed April 7, 2017, by a 54-45 Senate vote. Brett Kavanaugh, nominated July 9, 2018, to replace Anthony Kennedy, faced contentious hearings over sexual misconduct allegations but was confirmed October 6, 2018, 50-48. Amy Coney Barrett, nominated September 26, 2020, after Ruth Bader Ginsburg's death, was confirmed October 26, 2020, 52-48, solidifying a 6-3 conservative tilt. These picks, vetted by the Federalist Society, emphasized originalist jurisprudence and were praised by conservatives for countering perceived judicial activism.

### Domestic policies and reforms

Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act into law on December 22, 2017, which reduced the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, lowered individual income tax rates across brackets, nearly doubled the standard deduction to $12,000 for individuals and $24,000 for couples, and capped state and local tax deductions at $10,000. The legislation also introduced opportunity zones to incentivize investment in low-income areas and allowed full expensing of certain capital investments. Empirical analyses indicate the TCJA stimulated short-term economic growth, with GDP increasing by approximately 0.3-0.9% annually in the initial years, though it raised federal debt by an estimated $1.9 trillion over a decade and disproportionately benefited higher-income households. 

The administration pursued extensive deregulation, issuing Executive Order 13771 in January 2017 requiring agencies to repeal two existing regulations for each new one, resulting in nearly eight regulations eliminated for every new significant rule between fiscal years 2017 and 2019. This effort eliminated over 20,000 pages of regulatory text and reduced the annual flow of major rules by about 27% compared to the Obama administration. Deregulation in sectors like finance and environment contributed to heightened business confidence and investment, though critics noted potential long-term risks to public safety and environmental standards.

In criminal justice, Trump signed the First Step Act on December 21, 2018, a bipartisan measure that retroactively applied fair sentencing reductions for crack cocaine offenses, expanded compassionate release options, banned restraints on pregnant inmates, and mandated risk-assessment tools to guide early release and reduce recidivism.  The act led to the release or sentence reduction for over 7,000 federal inmates by 2023, with studies showing lowered recidivism rates among participants in rehabilitation programs. It marked the first major federal sentencing reform in decades, focusing on rehabilitation over incarceration for non-violent offenders.

Energy policies emphasized fossil fuel production and independence, with Executive Order 13783 issued on March 28, 2017, directing reviews of Obama-era restrictions like the Clean Power Plan and promoting domestic oil, gas, and coal leasing on federal lands. These actions, combined with deregulation, facilitated increased drilling and exports, enabling the U.S. to achieve net petroleum exporter status for the first time in 70 years by September 2019. Domestic crude oil production reached a record 12.3 million barrels per day in 2019, reducing reliance on foreign imports and lowering energy prices for consumers.

Healthcare reforms targeted the Affordable Care Act (ACA), with multiple congressional repeal attempts failing, including the American Health Care Act passing the House but stalling in the Senate in 2017. Executive actions expanded short-term health plans, ended cost-sharing reduction payments in 2017 (leading to higher premiums), and promoted price transparency rules for hospitals and insurers starting in 2019.  These changes increased uninsured rates slightly from 8.8% in 2016 to 9.2% in 2019, while efforts to lower drug prices included executive orders for insulin caps and international reference pricing, though implementation faced legal challenges. Additional reforms improved Veterans Affairs accountability via the 2018 VA MISSION Act, enabling community care access and firing underperforming staff.

### Economic performance and trade policies

The U.S. economy experienced steady expansion from 2017 to 2019, with real GDP growth averaging 2.5 percent annually, reflecting contributions from consumer spending, business investment, and exports prior to the COVID-19 downturn. Annual real GDP increased by 2.3 percent in 2017, 2.9 percent in 2018, and 2.3 percent in 2019, outperforming the 1.6 percent average under the prior administration but falling short of the 3 percent target set by Trump. Unemployment declined from 4.7 percent in January 2017 to a 50-year low of 3.5 percent in February 2020, with record lows achieved for Black (5.4 percent) and Hispanic (3.9 percent) workers in 2019, driven by labor market tightness and wage growth averaging 3 percent annually. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose from 19,732 at inauguration to over 29,000 by late 2019, yielding cumulative returns of approximately 50 percent through 2019, bolstered by corporate tax reductions and repatriation of overseas profits.

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), signed on December 22, 2017, lowered the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and adjusted individual brackets, aiming to stimulate investment and growth. Short-term effects included a 11 percent rise in business investment in 2018 and accelerated GDP growth that year, though empirical analyses found limited long-term boosts to productivity or wages beyond initial repatriation of $777 billion in foreign earnings. Federal revenues initially dipped but partially recovered via dynamic effects, yet deficits widened: from $665 billion in fiscal year 2017 to $984 billion in 2019, as spending outpaced revenue gains estimated at $200-300 billion annually from growth feedback. Deregulatory efforts, including repeal of over 20 major rules and a "two-for-one" executive order, reduced compliance costs by an estimated $50 billion annually, contributing to energy sector output growth of 10 percent in 2018-2019, though quantifiable GDP impacts remained modest at 0.1-0.2 percent per studies from the Council of Economic Advisers.

Trade policies emphasized reciprocity and protectionism, with tariffs imposed on steel (25 percent) and aluminum (10 percent) imports in March 2018 under Section 232, affecting $48 billion in goods, and escalating Section 301 tariffs on $380 billion of Chinese imports by 2019 to address intellectual property theft and subsidies. These measures reduced the U.S.-China goods trade deficit by 18 percent from 2018 to 2019 ($419 billion to $345 billion), prompting some supply chain shifts, but overall U.S. trade deficit expanded to $576 billion in 2019 due to stronger dollar and domestic demand. Manufacturing employment rose by about 450,000 jobs from January 2017 to peak in February 2020 (to 12.8 million), partly attributable to tariffs shielding sectors like steel, though retaliatory tariffs cost an estimated 75,000 jobs in export-exposed industries like agriculture. The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), signed November 30, 2018, and effective July 1, 2020, updated NAFTA with stronger labor and digital trade rules, preserving 90 percent of prior content while boosting auto sector wages; early implementation showed minimal disruption to North American supply chains.

The COVID-19 recession in 2020 contracted GDP by 2.2 percent annually and spiked unemployment to 14.8 percent in April, with federal deficits surging to $3.1 trillion amid $2.9 trillion in relief spending, overshadowing prior gains. Pre-pandemic performance, however, sustained median household income growth to $68,700 in 2019 (inflation-adjusted), the highest on record, underscoring resilience from policy-induced business confidence despite critiques of deficit expansion and uneven tariff benefits.

### Foreign policy and national security

Trump's foreign policy emphasized an "America First" approach, prioritizing U.S. national interests, economic security, and military strength over multilateral commitments perceived as detrimental to American sovereignty. The 2017 National Security Strategy, released on December 18, 2017, outlined four pillars: protecting the homeland and American way of life, promoting American prosperity, preserving peace through strength, and advancing U.S. influence globally. This realist framework shifted from prior administrations' emphasis on global promotion of democracy, focusing instead on great-power competition with China and Russia, border security, and rejecting deals that imposed uneven burdens on the U.S.

In the Middle East, the administration accelerated the campaign against ISIS, defeating its territorial caliphate in Iraq and Syria by March 2019, with U.S.-led coalition forces reclaiming over 95% of ISIS-held territory from its 2014 peak. Key operations included the raid killing ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi on October 26, 2019, in Syria, which Trump described as a major blow to the group's remnants. The U.S. withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal (JCPOA) on May 8, 2018, arguing it failed to permanently block Iran's nuclear path, enriched the regime, and enabled regional aggression; the administration reimposed sanctions in 17 rounds targeting Iranian entities. Diplomatic breakthroughs included the Abraham Accords, signed September 15, 2020, normalizing relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, followed by Sudan and Morocco, marking the first major Arab-Israeli peace deals in over 25 years without requiring Israeli concessions on Palestinian statehood.

Toward Asia, Trump pursued direct diplomacy with North Korea, holding summits with Kim Jong Un: the first in Singapore on June 12, 2018, yielding a joint statement committing to denuclearization and peace but lacking verifiable steps; the second in Hanoi on February 27-28, 2019, collapsed without agreement after North Korea offered partial facility dismantlement for sanctions relief, which the U.S. rejected; a third meeting occurred at the DMZ on June 30, 2019. Outcomes included a temporary halt in missile tests and summits' symbolic thaw but no dismantling of North Korea's nuclear arsenal, which continued expansion. The trade war with China, initiated in 2018, imposed tariffs on over $360 billion in Chinese goods by 2020, targeting intellectual property theft and trade imbalances; this culminated in the Phase One agreement signed January 15, 2020, under which China pledged $200 billion in U.S. purchases and structural reforms, though compliance fell short on agriculture and IP commitments.

In Europe and with multilateral institutions, Trump pressured NATO allies to meet the 2% GDP defense spending guideline agreed in 2014, resulting in eight allies achieving it by 2020—up from three in 2016—and overall alliance spending rising by $130 billion since 2016. The U.S. withdrew from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty on August 2, 2019, citing Russia's deployment of prohibited missiles since 2014 and China's exclusion from the pact, which limited only U.S. and Russian capabilities. Withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement was announced June 1, 2017, effective November 4, 2020, due to its projected $2.7 million annual job losses and economic disadvantages for U.S. workers relative to competitors like China and India.

On Afghanistan, the administration signed the Doha Agreement with the Taliban on February 29, 2020, committing to a full U.S. troop withdrawal by May 1, 2021, in exchange for Taliban guarantees against terrorist safe havens, counterterrorism cooperation, and intra-Afghan talks; U.S. forces numbered about 8,600 at signing, down from 14,000. National security measures included establishing the U.S. Space Force on December 20, 2019, as the sixth military branch to address space domain threats, and increasing defense budgets to $738 billion in fiscal year 2020, emphasizing modernization and lethality. Executive orders restricted travel from several terrorism-prone countries starting January 27, 2017, upheld by the Supreme Court in June 2018 after legal challenges. In April 2018, the administration implemented a "zero tolerance" immigration enforcement policy that resulted in the separation of approximately 5,000 children from their parents at the U.S.–Mexico border. The policy drew widespread condemnation from international human rights organizations and religious leaders, leading Trump to sign an executive order ending the practice in June 2018, though subsequent reports indicated challenges in reunifying separated families.
### COVID-19 response and health policy

On January 31, 2020, President Trump issued a proclamation suspending entry into the United States of non-citizens who had recently traveled from China, excluding Hong Kong and Macau, in response to the emerging COVID-19 outbreak; this action preceded similar restrictions by many other nations and aimed to limit importation of cases. On March 11, 2020, he expanded restrictions by prohibiting travel from the Schengen Area of Europe, effective March 13, which further sought to curb transatlantic spread amid rising European cases. These measures, while criticized by some public health experts for potential overreach or delays in domestic preparedness, correlated with reduced early importation risks according to epidemiological analyses.

Trump declared a national emergency on March 13, 2020, retroactive to March 1, unlocking federal resources including $50 billion for state and local aid, activation of the Defense Production Act for medical supplies, and enhanced testing and surveillance capabilities. This facilitated rapid procurement of ventilators and personal protective equipment, though supply chain bottlenecks persisted due to global demand. On March 27, 2020, he signed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, a $2.2 trillion package providing direct payments to individuals, expanded unemployment benefits, and Paycheck Protection Program loans to sustain businesses and prevent widespread insolvency. The Act's fiscal stimulus mitigated immediate economic collapse, with GDP contraction limited to 3.4% in Q2 2020 compared to deeper recessions elsewhere, though long-term inflationary pressures emerged later.

During a press briefing on April 23, 2020, Trump drew significant scrutiny from medical professionals after speculating about the potential of treating the virus by injecting disinfectants or applying ultraviolet light inside the body. While Trump later claimed the remarks were sarcastic, the comments prompted warnings from health agencies and manufacturers against ingesting cleaning products.

In vaccine development, Trump launched Operation Warp Speed on May 15, 2020, a public-private partnership investing $18 billion to accelerate candidates through parallel manufacturing, clinical trials, and regulatory review without compromising safety standards. This effort enabled Emergency Use Authorizations for the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines by December 2020, months ahead of typical timelines, crediting parallel processes and pre-purchase commitments that de-risked production; over 10 million doses were distributed by January 2021. Independent assessments affirm Warp Speed's role in compressing development from years to under one, averting potentially millions of additional deaths via early availability.

Trump's public communications included promoting hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine as potential treatments starting March 19, 2020, citing early anecdotal reports and small studies from France and China suggesting efficacy against viral replication in vitro. He personally announced taking hydroxychloroquine prophylactically in May 2020, despite FDA cautions on cardiac risks, which prompted stockpiling and off-label use; subsequent large-scale trials, including randomized controlled studies, found no mortality benefit and potential harm, with one analysis estimating 17,000 excess U.S. deaths linked to its widespread adoption. The FDA revoked its emergency authorization for these drugs in COVID-19 treatment by June 2020 based on accumulating evidence of inefficacy.

Broader health policy under Trump emphasized deregulation and transparency, including executive orders in 2019-2020 mandating price and quality disclosures by hospitals and insurers to empower consumer choice, alongside expansions of short-term limited-duration plans for affordability. The administration advanced the Right to Try Act in 2018, facilitating access to experimental therapies for terminally ill patients, and prioritized mental health parity enforcement, though COVID-19 overshadowed these with a focus on surge capacity and telehealth flexibilities via the CARES Act, which temporarily lifted restrictions to enable remote care amid lockdowns. Overall, U.S. COVID-19 outcomes reflected decentralized state responses, with federal coordination enabling over 300 million tests by late 2020 but challenged by inconsistent messaging and variant surges.
### Impeachments, investigations, and internal controversies

The Special Counsel investigation led by Robert Mueller, appointed on May 17, 2017, examined Russian interference in the 2016 election and potential coordination with the Trump campaign, as well as instances of obstruction of justice. The probe resulted in indictments of 34 individuals, including Russian intelligence officers and Trump associates like Paul Manafort and Michael Flynn, but concluded that the evidence "does not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities." On obstruction, the report detailed ten episodes, including Trump's firing of FBI Director James Comey on May 9, 2017, and efforts to remove Mueller, but deferred to Congress on prosecutorial decisions due to Justice Department policy against indicting a sitting president, stating it "does not exonerate him." Attorney General William Barr's March 24, 2019, summary emphasized no collusion finding, countering extensive media speculation beforehand. In December 2020, Trump issued pardons to several associates convicted in connection with investigations, including Paul Manafort, Roger Stone, and Charles Kushner.

Trump's first impeachment arose from a July 25, 2019, phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, where Trump requested investigations into Joe Biden and his son Hunter's activities in Ukraine, amid a hold on $391 million in military aid approved by Congress. A whistleblower complaint filed on August 12, 2019, prompted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to announce an impeachment inquiry on September 24, 2019, focusing on abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The House approved two articles of impeachment on December 18, 2019, by party-line votes of 230–197 and 229–198, without bipartisan support or evidence of a quid pro quo beyond the call transcript released by the White House. The Senate trial, from January 16 to February 5, 2020, ended in acquittal on both counts, with votes of 52–48 and 53–47, falling short of the two-thirds threshold; no Republican senators voted to convict.

The Trump administration faced numerous congressional investigations into matters like emoluments clause violations from foreign payments to Trump properties and use of the office for personal gain, though federal courts largely dismissed these suits for lack of standing or on jurisdictional grounds by 2021. Internal controversies included high staff turnover, with over 80% of top White House positions changing hands by 2020, attributed to policy clashes and loyalty demands; notable firings encompassed Attorney General Jeff Sessions on November 7, 2018, and multiple inspectors general in 2020, prompting accusations of retaliation against oversight. Leaks of classified information surged, leading to a 2017 Justice Department probe that obtained reporters' records, criticized for overreach but yielding few prosecutions. An anonymous September 5, 2018, *New York Times* op-ed by "Senior Administration Official" claimed internal resistance to Trump's agenda, later revealed in 2022 as written by Miles Taylor, fueling perceptions of a "deep state" within the administration. These events, while generating partisan media coverage often amplifying unverified claims, were defended by Trump as necessary to combat bureaucratic obstruction, with empirical data showing sustained policy implementation despite turmoil.

The House of Representatives impeached Trump on January 13, 2021—seven days before his term ended—for "incitement of insurrection," alleging he "willfully made statements that... encouraged—and foreseeably resulted in—imminent lawless action at the Capitol."

### 2020 election challenges and January 6 events

Following the November 3, 2020, presidential election, in which Joseph R. Biden secured 306 electoral votes to Donald Trump's 232, Trump and his campaign contested the results in several battleground states, alleging irregularities primarily related to mail-in voting procedures, ballot handling, and voter authentication. Trump declared victory prematurely on November 4, citing leads in key states that later narrowed as mail-in ballots were tabulated, and urged supporters to "stop the count" in some instances while demanding full counts in others. The campaign filed over 60 lawsuits across states including Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan, Arizona, and Wisconsin, seeking to invalidate ballots or alter certification processes based on claims of fraud, improper signature matching, and unauthorized changes to voting rules. Federal and state courts, including those presided over by judges appointed by Trump, dismissed or rejected the vast majority of these cases, often citing lack of standing, insufficient evidence of widespread misconduct, or procedural bars; for instance, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to intervene in Pennsylvania and Texas challenges without issuing substantive rulings on fraud allegations.

In Georgia, where Biden's margin was approximately 11,779 votes, a hand recount of over 5 million ballots completed on November 19 confirmed Biden's victory, reducing the margin by only 1,300 votes after resolving provisional and absentee discrepancies. A subsequent state-ordered audit and risk-limiting audit in December further validated the results, leading to recertification by Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger on December 7, despite Trump's phone call on January 2, 2021, for Raffensperger to "find 11,780 votes," which Raffensperger's office described as an attempt to influence the outcome without evidence. In Arizona's Maricopa County, a partisan audit led by Cyber Ninjas, commissioned by the Republican-led state Senate and completed in September 2021, examined over 2.1 million ballots and found no substantial fraud, actually increasing Biden's margin by 360 votes while identifying procedural issues unrelated to outcome-altering misconduct. Similar recounts and forensic reviews in Michigan and Wisconsin upheld certifications, with courts ruling that isolated irregularities, such as duplicate ballots or clerical errors, did not indicate systemic fraud capable of overturning results.

Trump's efforts extended beyond courts to pressuring state legislators and the Department of Justice; he suggested naming special counsels to investigate claims and floated replacing Vice President Mike Pence's ceremonial role in certification. Mainstream media and academic analyses, often aligned with Democratic perspectives, emphasized the absence of evidence for outcome-changing fraud, while conservative outlets highlighted statistical anomalies like late-night ballot batches favoring Biden; however, empirical reviews by state officials and bipartisan election boards consistently found no causal link to widespread invalidation. All 50 states and the District of Columbia certified results by early December 2020, paving the way for the Electoral College vote on December 14.

On January 6, 2021, Trump addressed a "Save America" rally of thousands near the White House Ellipse, criticizing the election as "rigged" and urging attendees to "walk down to the Capitol" to "peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard" while also stating, "We fight like hell, and if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore." The speech, lasting from approximately 12:00 p.m. to 1:10 p.m., preceded breaches of Capitol barriers starting around 12:53 p.m., with rioters overwhelming police lines and entering the building by 2:13 p.m., disrupting the joint session of Congress certifying electoral votes. Violence ensued, including assaults on officers, vandalism, and searches for Pence and lawmakers; Ashli Babbitt was fatally shot by Capitol Police while attempting to breach a barricaded door, and four other deaths occurred—one from natural causes during the event and three suicides among participants or officers in subsequent days.

Trump tweeted at 2:24 p.m. calling for peace—"Please support our Capitol Police and Law Enforcement. They are truly on the side of our Country. Stay peaceful!"—but did not immediately condemn the breach or direct dispersal. At 4:17 p.m., he released a video stating, "I know your pain... but you have to go home now. We have to have peace," while reiterating election grievances. The Capitol was cleared by evening, and certification resumed after 8:00 p.m., affirming Biden's win. National Guard deployment, requested by Capitol Police chief but delayed pending approvals, arrived post-breach, with Pentagon timelines showing planning from December 31, 2020, but execution lags criticized in congressional reviews. The events prompted Trump's second impeachment by the House on January 13 for "incitement of insurrection," though the Senate acquitted him on February 13, 2021, with 57 senators voting guilty but falling short of the two-thirds threshold.

In Georgia, procedural flaws were identified in Fulton County, including double-scanned ballots and recount errors, but official audits and investigations found no evidence of widespread fraud or ballot stuffing altering the outcome, affirming Biden's 11,779-vote win.
## Post-presidency I (2021–2025)
### Legal battles and indictments

Trump faced multiple criminal indictments and civil lawsuits during his post-presidency period from 2021 to 2024, becoming the first former U.S. president to be federally indicted. These cases stemmed primarily from his handling of classified documents, efforts to challenge the 2020 election results, and pre-presidential business practices. Critics, including Trump, characterized the prosecutions as politically motivated election interference, pointing to the timing ahead of his 2024 campaign and the Democratic affiliations of key prosecutors such as Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, who had campaigned on holding Trump accountable, and Fulton County DA Fani Willis. Supporters of the cases argued they addressed potential violations of law independent of politics.

In the New York state case alleging falsification of business records, Trump was indicted on 34 felony counts on March 30, 2023, related to $130,000 in hush money payments to adult film actress Stormy Daniels in 2016 to suppress claims of an affair. Prosecutors claimed the payments, facilitated through his former attorney Michael Cohen, were disguised as legal expenses to influence the election. Trump pleaded not guilty, asserting the payments were legitimate and the case revived a misdemeanor after the statute of limitations via a novel legal theory elevating it to felony election interference. A jury convicted him on all counts on May 30, 2024, following a trial that featured testimony from Cohen and Daniels. Sentencing was delayed pending appeals, with Trump maintaining the verdict was tainted by biased witnesses and judicial overreach.

The federal classified documents case, brought by Special Counsel Jack Smith, resulted in a June 8, 2023, indictment on 37 felony counts under the Espionage Act and obstruction statutes for retaining over 325 classified materials at Mar-a-Lago after leaving office and obstructing retrieval efforts. A superseding indictment in July 2023 added three more obstruction counts. Trump pleaded not guilty, arguing he had declassification authority as president and that the documents were stored securely. On July 15, 2024, U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon dismissed the case, ruling Smith's appointment unconstitutional and lacking congressional authorization for his funding and authority. The Justice Department appealed but later dropped efforts against Trump after his 2024 election win, citing departmental policy against prosecuting a sitting president.

In the federal election interference case, Smith indicted Trump on August 1, 2023, on four counts including conspiracy to defraud the United States and obstructing an official proceeding, related to alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election results, including pressuring officials and the fake electors scheme. Trump pleaded not guilty on August 3, 2023, claiming his actions were protected political speech and official acts. The case was paused after the Supreme Court's July 1, 2024, ruling in *Trump v. United States* granting absolute immunity for core presidential acts and presumptive immunity for others, requiring remand to assess charges. Smith filed a revised indictment on August 27, 2024, narrowing allegations to unofficial acts, but the case was dismissed on November 25, 2024, following Trump's election victory and DOJ policy. A January 2025 special counsel report concluded evidence supported conviction on remaining counts but prosecution was foreclosed.

The Georgia state election interference case saw Trump and 18 co-defendants indicted on August 14, 2023, on 13 counts under RICO statutes for allegedly conspiring to unlawfully reverse Joe Biden's 2020 win in the state, including a January 2, 2021, call to Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger urging him to "find" 11,780 votes. Trump pleaded not guilty, framing his actions as legitimate challenges to election irregularities. Proceedings stalled amid conflicts over Willis's romantic relationship with prosecutor Nathan Wade, leading to Wade's resignation in March 2024. A state appeals court removed six counts in March 2024 for improper wording, and further delays ensued; as of late 2024, no trial date was set, with the case effectively paused post-election.

Civilly, in a New York Attorney General case, Trump was found liable on February 16, 2024, for fraudulently inflating asset values to secure loans, resulting in a $454 million judgment including interest, which he appealed as biased and lacking victim harm given repaid loans at profit. In E. Jean Carroll's defamation suits, juries awarded $5 million in May 2023 and $83.3 million in January 2024 for denying her 1990s assault allegation, with Trump countersuing unsuccessfully and appealing on First Amendment grounds.

In May 2025, the U.S. accepted a Boeing 747-8 jet from Qatar valued at approximately $400 million for potential use as an interim Air Force One after retrofitting, following Trump's February tour of the aircraft; the gift raised ethics concerns under the Foreign Emoluments Clause from critics, though it was directed to the government.

### Political activities and influence within the GOP

Following his departure from the White House on January 20, 2021, Trump sustained his prominence within the Republican Party through frequent public appearances at rallies, conservative conferences such as the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), and targeted endorsements of candidates aligned with his "America First" agenda. These activities emphasized loyalty to his 2020 election challenges, criticism of establishment figures perceived as disloyal—such as Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger—and advocacy for policies prioritizing immigration enforcement, trade protectionism, and opposition to multilateral institutions. Trump's Save America PAC, established in November 2021, raised over $100 million by mid-2022, funding endorsements and party-aligned efforts while pressuring Republicans to adopt positions echoing his tenure, including skepticism toward federal agencies and support for election integrity measures.

Trump's endorsement strategy proved highly effective in reshaping GOP primaries, serving as a litmus test for party fidelity. In the lead-up to the 2022 midterms, he issued over 200 endorsements for Republican candidates across Senate, House, and gubernatorial races, with endorsed contenders securing victories in approximately 92% of contested primaries as of September 2022. Notable successes included J.D. Vance in Ohio's Senate primary (July 2022) and Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania's (May 2022), where Trump's backing mobilized base voters and deterred rivals. This pattern persisted into the 2024 cycle, where Trump endorsed more candidates than in any prior election, achieving primary win rates exceeding 90% in key states, thereby sidelining traditional conservatives and elevating MAGA-aligned figures like Mike Johnson, who became House Speaker in October 2023 after Trump's implicit support amid leadership turmoil.

The cumulative impact elevated Trump's de facto control over the GOP, transforming it from a coalition of fiscal conservatives and neoconservatives toward a populist, nationalist entity centered on his personal brand. By 2024, party platforms and rhetoric increasingly mirrored Trump's priorities, such as tariffs on China and border wall expansion, with dissenters facing primary challenges or marginalization—evident in the ouster of RNC chair Ronna McDaniel in March 2024 after internal pressure from Trump allies. Fundraising dominance further entrenched this shift, as Trump's joint fundraising committees amassed over $300 million from 2021 to 2023, dwarfing competitors and enabling retribution against perceived adversaries like Mitt Romney. While general election outcomes for endorsees were mixed—with 199 wins but 34 losses in 2022, including defeats in competitive swing districts— the primary dominance underscored Trump's gatekeeping role, compelling the party to prioritize voter mobilization over electability debates favored by pre-2016 establishments.

## 2024 campaign and transition

### Campaign strategy and primaries

Trump announced his candidacy for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination on November 15, 2022, at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, positioning himself as the leading contender by emphasizing "America First" policies and criticizing the Biden administration's handling of inflation, border security, and foreign affairs. His primary strategy relied on mobilizing his loyal base through rallies, social media, and endorsements from GOP figures, while framing multiple indictments as "witch hunts" to portray himself as a victim of elite persecution, which resonated with voters skeptical of institutional narratives. Trump campaigned selectively in early states due to ongoing trials, yet maintained double-digit leads in national Republican polls throughout, avoiding the need for extensive ground operations against challengers who struggled to consolidate anti-Trump support.

The field included Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, and former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, but most dropped out before or shortly after voting began, leaving Haley as the primary rival. Trump won the Iowa caucuses on January 15, 2024, with 51% of the vote—a record 30+ point margin in a contested GOP contest—compared to DeSantis's 21% and Haley's 19%, capturing all 40 delegates despite harsh weather and limited personal appearances. DeSantis suspended his campaign on January 21, 2024, endorsing Trump and urging party unity.

In the New Hampshire primary on January 23, 2024, Trump defeated Haley 54% to 43%, securing 11 of 22 delegates despite her appeal to moderate independents and write-in efforts. He followed with a dominant win in South Carolina on February 24, 2024, taking approximately 60% to Haley's 40% in her home state, claiming all 50 delegates amid heavy local endorsements and attacks portraying her as insufficiently conservative.

| Contest          | Date         | Trump Vote Share | Haley Vote Share | Delegates to Trump |
|------------------|--------------|------------------|------------------|--------------------|
| Iowa Caucuses   | Jan 15, 2024| 51%             | 19%             | 40/40             |
| New Hampshire   | Jan 23, 2024| 54%             | 43%             | 11/22             |
| South Carolina  | Feb 24, 2024| ~60%            | ~40%            | 50/50             |

Super Tuesday on March 5, 2024, delivered sweeping victories for Trump across 15 states, amplifying his delegate haul. Haley suspended her campaign on March 6, 2024, without endorsing Trump, leaving him unopposed. Trump clinched the nomination on March 12, 2024, surpassing the 1,215-delegate threshold with over 1,300 secured, ahead of the Republican National Convention.

### General election victory and electoral analysis

Donald Trump defeated Democratic nominee Kamala Harris in the 2024 United States presidential election held on November 5, 2024, securing 312 electoral votes to Harris's 226.  This marked Trump's victory in all seven swing states—Pennsylvania (19 votes), Michigan (15), Wisconsin (10), Georgia (16), North Carolina (16), Arizona (11), and Nevada (6)—flipping six from their 2020 results to Biden while retaining North Carolina.  Trump's electoral margin exceeded his 2016 performance but fell short of a landslide, reflecting concentrated wins in battlegrounds amid narrower national support.

In the national popular vote, Trump garnered 49.8% (approximately 77.3 million votes) to Harris's 48.3% (about 75.0 million), achieving the first Republican popular vote victory since George W. Bush in 2004 by a margin of 1.5 percentage points.  Voter turnout reached 65.3% of the voting-age population, lower than the 66.6% in 2020, with registered voters at 73.6%. Trump's coalition expanded demographically, drawing 57% of white voters (up slightly from 2020), 45% of Hispanic voters (a 13-point gain), and 13% of black voters (a 5-point increase), alongside strong support from men (55%) and non-college-educated workers.  These shifts were particularly evident among young men and urban working-class voters, where Trump improved by double digits in several subgroups.

Electoral analysis attributes Trump's success to higher retention and turnout among his 2020 supporters compared to Harris's base, with Trump voters from the prior cycle participating at rates exceeding Biden's by several points. Key drivers included voter priorities on inflation and immigration, where Trump led Harris by wide margins in exit polling; economic dissatisfaction lingered from post-2021 recovery challenges, including sustained price increases averaging 20% since 2020. Harris underperformed among core Democratic groups, losing ground with black (86% support vs. Biden's 92%) and Hispanic voters, partly due to perceived policy failures on border security and urban crime. Trump's campaign emphasized cultural appeals to male voters via podcasts and direct messaging, amplifying gains in Rust Belt and Sun Belt suburbs.

The victory reflected broader realignments, with Republicans gaining among non-white working-class voters disillusioned by Democratic governance, while Harris's late entry after Biden's withdrawal limited her ability to consolidate the coalition. Trump's resilience following two assassination attempts in July 2024 bolstered his narrative of defiance, though data shows vote shifts predated these events and tied more directly to pocketbook issues. Overall, the result signaled a mandate on economic nationalism and border enforcement, with Trump's popular vote plurality underscoring polarized but mobilized support rather than broad consensus.

## Second presidency (2025–present)

### Inauguration and initial executive actions

Donald Trump was sworn in as the 47th President of the United States on January 20, 2025, at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., marking the commencement of his second non-consecutive term. Due to dangerously cold weather, the ceremony was moved indoors to the Capitol Rotunda—the first such indoor swearing-in since Ronald Reagan's in 1985—held amid heightened security measures. It featured his inaugural address in which he pledged to deliver a "golden age" for America through renewed focus on national security, economic strength, and reversal of preceding policies. Attendees included members of Congress, Supreme Court justices, and dignitaries, including foreign heads of state and government personally invited by the president-elect, marking the first U.S. presidential inauguration attended by such figures; due to the indoor format and weather, there was no traditional outdoor parade, with compensatory events including a victory rally at Capital One Arena on January 19 and a post-inaugural rally that evening.

On inauguration day, Trump signed over a dozen executive orders and a presidential memorandum to advance immediate priorities, issuing more actions in the first weeks than many predecessors in their initial months. A key memorandum imposed a nationwide freeze on hiring federal civilian employees, excluding military, public safety, and immigration enforcement personnel, to enable a comprehensive review of agency workforces and eliminate redundancies. This action complemented Executive Order 14170, which mandated accountability measures in federal hiring to prioritize merit over ideological criteria. Additionally, an order rescinded multiple prior directives from the Biden administration, including those on climate regulations, equity mandates, and certain foreign aid programs, aiming to reduce regulatory burdens estimated at over $200 billion annually.

Executive Order 14158, signed January 20, created the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), tasked with identifying $2 trillion in federal spending cuts, streamlining bureaucracy, and implementing mass deregulation through temporary appointments empowered to overhaul agencies. In law enforcement and border security, EO 14159 directed enhanced federal support for local police to combat urban crime and cartel activities, while subsequent actions accelerated deportations and wall construction restarts. National security measures included EO 14157, imposing reciprocal tariffs on Chinese imports linked to the fentanyl supply chain, which contributed to over 100,000 U.S. overdose deaths in 2024, and EO 14166, enforcing divestiture or bans on TikTok due to data security risks.

Energy independence and infrastructure received prompt attention via EO 14156, mandating upgrades to the electric grid's resilience against cyber and physical threats, and EO 14154, reforming nuclear oversight to expedite reactor approvals and prioritize empirical safety data over precautionary models.  Military readiness was bolstered by EO 14148, emphasizing combat effectiveness and reversing diversity-focused recruitment policies. On social policy, EO 14168 prohibited biological males from women's and girls' sports in federally funded programs and restored merit-based standards in the armed forces, followed by EO 14183 on January 27, which barred federal endorsement of gender transition procedures for minors and ideological training in schools. 

By late January, additional orders addressed urban revitalization (EO 14189 for Washington, D.C., crime reduction) and education (EO 14190 reinstating discipline policies in public schools), reflecting a broader push to devolve authority from federal levels and enforce existing statutes without new legislation.  These actions, numbering over 70 by mid-February, faced immediate legal challenges from states and advocacy groups but advanced through expedited agency implementations, with early reports indicating workforce reductions exceeding 10,000 positions via attrition and buyouts.
### Domestic agenda and policy implementations

Upon inauguration on January 20, 2025, President Trump issued a presidential memorandum imposing a freeze on federal civilian hiring across the executive branch, prohibiting the filling of vacant positions or creation of new ones without explicit approval, aimed at reducing bureaucratic expansion. This action extended through October 15, 2025, for most agencies, facilitating efforts to restructure the federal workforce, including revival of Schedule F provisions to reclassify policy-influencing civil servants as at-will employees for easier dismissal. On the same day, an executive order terminated Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA) programs government-wide, directing agencies to eliminate related initiatives and redirect resources.

Economic policies emphasized deregulation and tax relief. Executive Order 14150, "Unleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation," signed January 31, 2025, instructed agencies to identify and repeal regulations costing over $100 million annually, targeting a net reduction in regulatory burden equivalent to 10 rules repealed for every new one proposed. On July 4, 2025, Trump signed the "One Big Beautiful Bill," a comprehensive tax and domestic policy measure extending provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, including corporate rate permanence at 21% and individual deductions, while reforming Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) eligibility to impose stricter work requirements, potentially affecting 5-10 million recipients based on state implementation variances.

Energy production received priority through Executive Order on "Unleashing American Energy" issued January 20, 2025, which revoked prior restrictions on fossil fuel development, expedited permitting for oil, gas, and coal projects on federal lands, and lifted moratoriums on liquefied natural gas exports, leading to a reported 15% increase in domestic crude production permits by September 2025. An April 8, 2025, order further promoted coal energy exports by easing federal oversight, aligning with goals to achieve energy dominance and reduce reliance on foreign imports.

Immigration enforcement domestically involved enhanced border security and interior removals. Executive orders expanded military deployment for border operations and allocated resources for mass deportation campaigns, with a September 16, 2025, law providing $170 billion for enforcement, detention, and deportation infrastructure, enabling the removal of over 1 million individuals by October 2025 according to Department of Homeland Security reports. A September 19, 2025, proclamation imposed a $100,000 fee on employers for H-1B visas, aiming to prioritize American workers and curb outsourcing, though projections indicated potential workforce reductions of up to 15 million by 2035 due to curtailed legal immigration.

Additional implementations addressed speech and oversight. An early executive order restored free speech protections by directing cessation of federal censorship partnerships with tech firms and revoking prior guidance on content moderation. Efforts to improve federal grantmaking oversight, via an August 7, 2025, order, mandated reviews to eliminate waste and ideological bias in allocations exceeding $10 billion annually. These actions, tracked across 210 executive orders by mid-2025, reflected a broader agenda to shrink government scope, though implementation faced legal challenges from states and advocacy groups.

In January 2025, Trump launched the $TRUMP meme coin, which peaked at a market cap exceeding $7 billion before declining, amid scrutiny over potential conflicts with his pro-crypto policies.

### Foreign relations and diplomatic engagements

Upon assuming office on January 20, 2025, President Trump directed the State Department to prioritize bilateral negotiations over multilateral institutions, emphasizing "America First" principles to secure favorable trade deals and reduce U.S. military commitments abroad. This approach included executive orders targeting perceived adversarial actions, such as the February 7, 2025, order prohibiting U.S. aid to South Africa in response to its international stances. Early diplomatic efforts focused on resolving ongoing conflicts through direct leader-to-leader engagement, as outlined in the October 13, 2025, Trump Declaration for Enduring Peace and Prosperity, which pledged dispute resolution via negotiation rather than prolonged military involvement.

In the Middle East, the administration facilitated a January 2025 Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal shortly after inauguration, building on prior Abraham Accords frameworks to expand normalization between Israel and Arab states. Priorities included deterring Iranian influence, with U.S. support for Israeli operations against Hezbollah, Houthis, and Tehran-backed networks; this culminated in authorized U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities in June 2025 to neutralize proliferation threats. These actions aimed to counter terrorism and stabilize energy markets, though critics from left-leaning think tanks argued they escalated regional tensions without comprehensive diplomacy.

Asia-Pacific engagements emphasized countering Chinese economic leverage through tariffs and alliances. An August 25, 2025, summit with South Korean President Lee Jae-myung reinforced defense commitments while pressing for increased host-nation burden-sharing on U.S. troop costs. In late June 2025, Trump attended the NATO summit in the Netherlands, where he demanded higher allied defense spending and critiqued European reliance on U.S. security guarantees, leading to pledges from several members to meet the 2% GDP target. A planned October 2025 Asia tour, including stops in Malaysia, Japan, and South Korea, sought trade concessions and a potential sidebar meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping to ease tariffs amid ongoing supply-chain disputes. 

Relations with Russia involved exploratory talks for de-escalation in Ukraine, though a proposed early summit with President Vladimir Putin stalled by October 2025 due to disagreements over territorial concessions. Trump touted broader diplomatic successes, from Gaza mediation to African stability initiatives, positioning them as evidence of conflict resolution without indefinite U.S. entanglement. Protectionist measures strained ties with partners like Canada, prompting reassessments of North American trade dependencies. Overall, these engagements reflected a transactional style, yielding mixed outcomes: tangible deals in select areas but heightened friction with adversaries and some allies skeptical of multilateral retreats.

## Personal life

### Marriages, family, and relationships

Donald Trump was born on June 14, 1946, as the fourth of five children to real estate developer Frederick Christ Trump Sr. (1905–1999) and homemaker Mary Anne MacLeod Trump (1912–2000), who emigrated from Scotland in 1930. His siblings included Maryanne Trump Barry (born 1937, died 2023), a former federal judge; Frederick Christ Trump Jr. (1938–1981), who died from complications of alcoholism; Elizabeth Trump Grau (born 1942); and Robert Trump (1948–2020), who worked in the family business. Trump has described his upbringing in a stable, affluent household in Queens, New York, where family loyalty and business acumen were emphasized by his father.

Trump's first marriage was to Czech-American socialite Ivana Zelníčková on April 7, 1977; the couple had three children—Donald Trump Jr. (born December 31, 1977), Ivanka Trump (born October 30, 1981), and Eric Trump (born January 6, 1984)—before divorcing in 1990 amid public revelations of Trump's extramarital affair with actress Marla Maples, which Ivana confirmed in divorce proceedings.  The divorce settlement included $14 million for Ivana, custody of the children, and a confidentiality clause, though Ivana later publicly discussed the affair's impact.

Trump married Maples on December 20, 1993, shortly after the birth of their daughter Tiffany Ariana Trump (born October 13, 1993); the marriage ended in separation in 1997 and divorce in 1999, with Maples receiving a $2 million settlement and primary custody of Tiffany.  Trump has maintained relationships with all his children from prior marriages, with Donald Jr., Ivanka, and Eric taking prominent roles in the Trump Organization and his political campaigns, while Tiffany has pursued a lower public profile.

Trump's third marriage, to Slovenian-born model Melania Knauss (born Melanija Knavs), occurred on January 22, 2005, at Bethesda-by-the-Sea Episcopal Church in Palm Beach, Florida, followed by a reception at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate; they have one son, Barron William Trump (born March 20, 2006).  The couple has presented a united family image publicly, with Melania focusing on Barron's privacy amid Trump's high-profile career, though unverified allegations of extramarital encounters, such as the 2006 payment to adult film actress Stephanie Clifford (Stormy Daniels), have been denied by Trump and did not lead to divorce. Trump has ten grandchildren from his older children as of 2025.

### Health, residences, and philanthropy

Trump's physician reported him in excellent overall health following an annual physical on April 11, 2025, at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, noting robust cardiac, pulmonary, neurological, and physical function despite his age of 78. The examination documented a 20-pound weight loss since prior assessments, lowered LDL cholesterol levels, and managed conditions such as diverticulosis with a benign polyp, with no impairments affecting executive duties. On July 13, 2024, Trump sustained a gunshot wound grazing his right ear during an assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania, resulting in scarring but full recovery without reported long-term effects, as confirmed in subsequent medical evaluations deeming him fully fit for command. A semiannual physical in October 2025 diagnosed chronic venous insufficiency, characterized by impaired vein valves in the legs leading to potential swelling and discomfort, though managed conservatively.

Trump's primary personal residence is Mar-a-Lago, a 126-room estate in Palm Beach, Florida, purchased in 1985 and converted into a private club in 1995, which he officially designated as his main home in September 2019 after relinquishing New York residency. As president, he resides at the White House in Washington, D.C., but frequently returns to Mar-a-Lago for official and personal activities. Other significant properties include Trump National Golf Club Bedminster in New Jersey, used for retreats and events, and the Trump Tower triplex penthouse in New York City, though he vacated it upon shifting primary residence southward.

The Donald J. Trump Foundation, established in 1988, was dissolved by court order in December 2018 after a New York Attorney General lawsuit documented illegal self-dealing, including using charitable assets for personal portraits, political events, and business settlements, prompting Trump to pay $2 million in restitution to eight nonprofits. Analyses of Trump's tax returns reveal personal cash charitable contributions totaling about $1.3 million from 2005 to 2015, with giving dropping to zero by 2020 amid his presidency, often comprising non-cash items like land conservation easements rather than direct donations post-2008. During his first term, Trump directed quarterly portions of his $400,000 annual presidential salary—totaling over $1.4 million—to federal agencies such as the National Park Service and Department of Education, verifiable through White House announcements. No major personal philanthropic initiatives have been publicly disclosed since the foundation's closure, though business entities under the Trump Organization have supported localized causes via golf events.
## Views, ideology, and legacy

### Core policy positions and worldview

Trump's worldview emphasizes an "America First" nationalism that prioritizes U.S. sovereignty, economic self-sufficiency, and national security over multilateral globalism and unconditional alliances. This perspective views international relations through a transactional lens, where diplomacy serves direct American interests, such as reducing trade imbalances and avoiding costly foreign entanglements, while maintaining military superiority to deter adversaries. He has consistently critiqued elite-driven institutions for eroding domestic priorities, advocating instead for policies that empower American workers, protect borders, and restore manufacturing dominance as foundational to national strength.

In economic policy, Trump supports protectionism via tariffs to counter unfair foreign competition, including a proposed universal baseline tariff on imports and reciprocal rates matching those imposed on U.S. goods, aimed at revitalizing domestic manufacturing and addressing trade deficits exceeding $900 billion annually in recent years. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, passed by Congress in 2025, extends most provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act—which reduced the corporate rate from 35% to 21% and individual rates across brackets—beyond their original expiration dates, alongside eliminating taxes on tips and overtime pay to boost worker incomes and curb inflation through deregulation and energy abundance.

On immigration, his positions center on stringent enforcement to halt illegal entries, including completing the border wall initiated during his first term, reinstating the "Remain in Mexico" policy, and launching the largest deportation operation in U.S. history targeting millions of undocumented individuals, with a focus on removing criminal elements and those straining public resources. This approach ties border security to economic and safety concerns, rejecting sanctuary policies and advocating merit-based legal immigration over chain migration.

Foreign policy under Trump's framework pursues "peace through strength," involving military modernization to counter threats from China, Russia, and Iran, while renegotiating alliances like NATO to ensure fair burden-sharing—evidenced by his first-term pressure that increased allied defense spending by over $130 billion annually. He opposes indefinite U.S. commitments abroad, as seen in withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership in 2017 and the Iran nuclear deal in 2018, and prioritizes brokering deals like the Abraham Accords for Middle East stability without direct military involvement.

Energy policy advocates unleashing domestic production, particularly fossil fuels, to achieve dominance and lower costs, including repealing electric vehicle mandates and expanding drilling on federal lands to counter reliance on foreign suppliers like OPEC nations. Domestically, he opposes federal promotion of ideologies such as critical race theory in schools, defends Second Amendment rights, and on abortion has stated opposition to federal bans or restrictions, supporting state-level decision-making following the Dobbs decision, which would allow states to completely restrict abortion (which no state has done) or allow abortion for any reason up until the moment of birth (which several states currently do). These positions frame preservation of constitutional freedoms against government overreach as essential. Overall, these positions reflect a causal emphasis on internal renewal—through secure borders, industrial revival, and fiscal discipline—as prerequisites for global influence.
### Public image, polls, and cultural impact

Trump's public image has long been marked by intense polarization, with strong loyalty from Republican voters who perceive him as an authentic voice against bureaucratic overreach and cultural elitism, contrasted by widespread disapproval among Democrats and independents who associate him with inflammatory rhetoric and institutional disruption. This divide stems in part from his background as a real estate developer and reality television personality, which cultivated a persona of brash deal-making and unfiltered commentary, resonating with working-class voters disillusioned by globalization and immigration policies. Mainstream media outlets, which empirical analyses have shown exhibit systemic negative bias in coverage of Trump compared to predecessors, have amplified criticisms of his personal style, often framing it as a threat to democratic norms without equivalent scrutiny of opposing figures.

Recent polling reflects this entrenched split, with Trump's job approval ratings stabilizing in the low-to-mid 40s during his second term amid economic pressures and a government shutdown. Favorability ratings similarly hover around 42-45% net negative, higher among white non-college-educated men (often exceeding 60%) and lower among urban, college-educated demographics (below 30%). These figures represent a modest improvement from his first term's troughs but remain below historical presidential averages, influenced by partisan turnout in surveys and persistent media narratives. Pollsters note minimal shifts despite events like the October 2025 shutdown, where public blame fell more on Congress than Trump personally. As of October 2025, Gallup records Trump's approval at 41%, surpassing Joe Biden's term low of 36% in July 2024 but below Biden's overall average of 42.2%.[408] [456] [457] Other polls, such as Emerson College, show figures around 45%, reflecting stability amid ongoing economic and foreign policy developments.[409]

| Pollster/Aggregator | Date | Approval Rating | Source |
|---------------------|------|-----------------|--------|
| Gallup              | October 22, 2025 | 41%            |  |
| Emerson College     | October 17, 2025 | 45%            |  |
| Nate Silver Bulletin (average) | October 26, 2025 | ~45% (net -9.5) |  |
| The Economist/YouGov | October 22, 2025 | Net -15%       |  |

Trump's cultural impact is profound, having accelerated the mainstreaming of populist nationalism through the Make America Great Again (MAGA) movement, which emphasizes economic protectionism, border security, and resistance to progressive cultural shifts. Originating from his 2016 campaign slogan, MAGA has evolved into a subculture with merchandise, rallies, and online communities that prioritize symbolic status restoration for perceived forgotten Americans, influencing global nativist politics from Europe to Latin America. His tenure popularized terms like "fake news" to critique institutional media credibility, fostering skepticism toward elite narratives and contributing to a more combative political discourse where direct confrontation supplants traditional civility.

In his second term, Trump's policies have targeted cultural institutions, including an executive order in March 2025 directing federal historical sites to prioritize "solemn and uplifting" narratives over what the administration deems ideologically driven interpretations, such as those emphasizing racial division in Smithsonian exhibits. Supporters hail this as a corrective to academia and museum biases documented in conservative analyses, while critics in outlets like The Guardian and The New Yorker decry it as authoritarian control, though such claims often overlook the administration's stated aim of empirical historical fidelity. His reality TV legacy and social media savvy have sustained a performative style that blends entertainment with governance, spawning parodies, merchandise empires, and a backlash against "woke" conformity, ultimately reshaping American identity debates around meritocracy and traditional values.

### Assessments from supporters and critics

Supporters of Donald Trump frequently highlight his first-term economic record, including the reduction of the national unemployment rate to a 50-year low of 3.5 percent in late 2019, alongside record-high employment levels reaching 160 million Americans.  They attribute these outcomes to deregulation efforts that spurred business investment and the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which lowered corporate rates from 35 percent to 21 percent and boosted median household incomes by over $5,000 in real terms by 2019. Advocates, including those from conservative policy organizations, also commend judicial appointments, such as three Supreme Court justices and over 200 federal judges, for advancing originalist interpretations of the Constitution and restricting regulatory overreach.

In foreign policy, Trump's backers praise the Abraham Accords of 2020, which normalized relations between Israel and several Arab nations including the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan, and Morocco, fostering economic ties and regional stability without concessions to the Palestinians.  Supporters emphasize his "America First" approach for avoiding new military engagements—marking the first such period in decades—and pressuring NATO allies to increase defense spending, which rose collectively by over $130 billion during his tenure. Into his second term as of 2025, Republican approval ratings for Trump remain robust, often exceeding 80 percent in partisan polls, reflecting sustained loyalty for perceived fulfillment of campaign promises on border security and economic nationalism.

Critics, often from mainstream media outlets and Democratic-aligned institutions, have accused Trump of undermining democratic norms through actions such as pressuring election officials in 2020 and the events surrounding January 6, 2021, which they characterize as an attempted insurrection despite his acquittal in subsequent Senate impeachment trials. They further contend that his administration prioritized personal loyalty over expertise, citing the firing of officials like FBI Director James Comey and frequent cabinet turnover exceeding 70 percent. Economic critiques focus on rising federal deficits, which surpassed $3 trillion in fiscal year 2020 amid COVID-19 responses, and pre-pandemic trade policies that imposed tariffs leading to retaliatory measures affecting U.S. agriculture.

In his second presidency, detractors express concerns over expanded executive authority, including directives to agencies like the CDC and Federal Reserve perceived as politicizing independent functions, with Pew Research indicating 49 percent of Americans viewing such moves as excessive compared to prior presidents. Mainstream sources have highlighted potential retribution against political opponents via the Justice Department, though supporters counter that these reflect accountability for prior investigations deemed politically motivated. Overall approval ratings in late 2025 hover around 41–45 percent, with polarization evident as critics in academia and legacy media amplify narratives of authoritarianism while empirical data on policy outcomes, such as sustained low unemployment pre-2020, often receives less emphasis in their assessments.
