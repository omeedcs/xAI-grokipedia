  "content": "# Post Malone\n\nAustin Richard Post (born July 4, 1995), known professionally as \"Post Malone\", is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, and record producer. Born in Syracuse, New York, and raised in Grapevine, Texas, he blends hip-hop, pop, rock, and country in his music, characterized by a raspy vocal delivery and introspective lyrics often addressing fame, substance use, and relationships.\n\nPost Malone rose to prominence with his 2015 debut single \"White Iverson\", which peaked at number 14 on the Billboard Hot 100 and garnered over one billion YouTube views for its music video. His debut album *Stoney* (2016) achieved multi-platinum status, followed by chart-topping releases *Beerbongs \\u0026 Bentleys* (2018) and *Hollywood's Bleeding* (2019), both debuting at number one on the Billboard 200 and producing number-one singles like \"Rockstar\" featuring 21 Savage and \"Circles.\" These albums contributed to his commercial dominance, with equivalent album sales exceeding 74 million units worldwide as of recent estimates.\n\nHe has received numerous accolades, including eleven Billboard Music Awards, five American Music Awards, and multiple MTV Video Music Awards, though he holds the distinction of the most Grammy nominations without a win as of 2025. In 2024, Post Malone ventured into country music with *F-1 Trillion*, released on August 16 and debuting at number one on the Billboard 200 with 250,000 equivalent units, earning him his first American Music Award in the country category for Favorite Male Country Artist in 2025. His genre versatility has drawn both praise for innovation and criticism for cultural appropriation in hip-hop circles early in his career.\n## Early life\n\n### Family background and upbringing\n\nAustin Richard Post was born on July 4, 1995, in Syracuse, New York, to mother Nicole Lake (née Frazier) and father Richard \"Rich\" Post Jr. His parents divorced during his early childhood, after which he was raised primarily by his father and stepmother Jodie, who had a son from a previous marriage.\n\nWhen Post was nine years old, the family relocated to Grapevine, Texas, where his father secured a position managing concessions for the Dallas Cowboys, later advancing to roles in food and beverage operations at AT\\u0026T Stadium. Rich Post, who had worked as a DJ earlier in life, maintained an extensive vinyl collection that introduced his son to diverse genres such as hip-hop, rock, metal, and country, shaping his early musical environment amid the local Texas cultural blend of country and urban influences.\n\nPost attended Grapevine High School, graduating in 2013, during which time he honed guitar skills initially through video games like Guitar Hero and explored various musical styles including rock and blues. The family home in Grapevine provided a stable setting for these pursuits, with his father's professional stability in sales and operations contributing to a structured upbringing.\n\n### Initial exposure to music\n\nPost Malone began developing his musical skills in his early teens through self-directed experimentation, primarily self-teaching guitar at age 14 via the video game *Guitar Hero*. The game's mechanics familiarized him with guitar fundamentals, after which he progressed by studying YouTube videos to learn actual playing techniques, bypassing traditional lessons. This accessible technology democratized his entry into music, allowing rapid skill acquisition without formal instruction or gatekept resources.\n\nHis initial songwriting drew from a broad, self-curated palette of influences crossing rock and hip-hop, including Nirvana's Kurt Cobain, Bob Dylan, Johnny Cash, and rapper 50 Cent. Around age 16, he produced his first solo rap mixtape using free software like Audacity, reflecting raw, unpolished creativity honed in isolation. Such digital tools enabled genre-agnostic exploration, fostering an intuitive blend of melodic and rhythmic elements untethered to industry norms or conventional training paths.\n\nFollowing high school, Malone briefly enrolled at Tarrant County College but dropped out after a short period, prioritizing full-time music pursuit over academics. He relocated to Los Angeles, where early SoundCloud uploads—including freestyle raps and covers like Bob Dylan's—showcased his unrefined vocal delivery and improvisational flair, evidencing innate talent amid technical limitations. These pre-professional efforts, amplified by platforms requiring no gatekeepers, laid the groundwork for organic virality, distinct from groomed artist pipelines.\n\n## Musical career\n\n### Career beginnings and Stoney (2011–2016)\n\nPost Malone relocated to Los Angeles in 2014 after briefly attending Tarrant County College, joining friends including Jason Probst to pursue music production and form the collective BLCKVRD. On February 4, 2015, he independently uploaded the track \"White Iverson\"—a freestyle over a trap beat produced with assistance from FKi—to SoundCloud, where it quickly amassed over 21 million streams through organic shares on Vine and YouTube, bypassing traditional label support.  The song's viral traction, driven by its melodic rap delivery and basketball references to Allen Iverson, prompted Republic Records to sign him in August 2015, marking his entry into major-label distribution.\n\nFollowing the signing, Malone released his debut mixtape *August 26th*—named for the initially planned launch of his album—on May 12, 2016, via DatPiff under Republic, featuring 10 tracks with guest appearances from 2 Chainz on \"Money Made Me Do It\" and Jeremih on \"Fuck.\" The project highlighted his self-taught production skills, honed via software like FL Studio, and a sound fusing hip-hop with sung hooks, which he described as genre-agnostic rather than confined to rap.\n\nHis debut studio album *Stoney* arrived on December 9, 2016, delayed from its summer target, debuting at number six on the Billboard 200 with 58,000 album-equivalent units in its first week, largely propelled by streaming metrics from tracks like the promotional single \"Congratulations\" featuring Quavo, released November 4, 2016.  Early live performances, including club shows and festival slots, supplemented this growth, fostering a grassroots fanbase through direct engagement rather than heavy radio or press reliance.\n\n### Mainstream breakthrough: Beerbongs \\u0026 Bentleys and Hollywood's Bleeding (2017–2019)\n\nPost Malone's second studio album, *Beerbongs \\u0026 Bentleys*, was released on April 27, 2018, by Republic Records and debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart, achieving the largest opening week for any album that year with 461,000 album-equivalent units consumed. The album was certified platinum by the RIAA on the day of its release based on pre-release sales and streaming activity. Key singles from the project, including \"Rockstar\" featuring 21 Savage—which topped the Billboard Hot 100 for eight consecutive weeks—and \"Psycho\" featuring Ty Dolla $ign, exemplified a fusion of trap beats with melodic hooks, driving the album's commercial ascent through billions of combined streams; \"Rockstar\" alone amassed over 2.7 billion Spotify streams and earned diamond certification from the RIAA for 10 million units.\n\nPost Malone sustained this momentum with his third album, *Hollywood's Bleeding*, released on September 6, 2019, which also debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and held the top spot for four nonconsecutive weeks, marking the first album of 2019 to achieve that feat. Standout tracks like \"Sunflower\" (with Swae Lee), initially tied to the *Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse* soundtrack in 2018 and later included on the album, became the first song to receive RIAA double-diamond certification for 20 million units, propelled by over 2.4 billion global streams at the time of its elevated status. \"Circles,\" showcasing Post Malone's evolving vocal range with introspective pop-rock elements, similarly reached diamond status and topped the Hot 100. These hits broadened his appeal beyond hip-hop audiences by integrating accessible melodies and genre-crossing production.\n\nThe period solidified Post Malone's live performance draw through the Runaway Tour in late 2019, which sold out multiple North American arenas, including two-night stands at venues like The Forum in Inglewood, generating grosses exceeding $2.9 million from those shows alone. Strategic collaborations, such as \"Take What You Want\" featuring Ozzy Osbourne and Travis Scott on *Hollywood's Bleeding*, prioritized sonic compatibility over strict genre boundaries, blending heavy metal riffs with rap verses. This approach contributed to Post Malone accumulating multiple diamond-certified singles from the era—\"Rockstar,\" \"Psycho,\" \"Sunflower,\" and \"Circles\"—helping him surpass records to hold the most RIAA diamond certifications for a rapper, with eight total by 2023.\n\n### Collaborations, Twelve Carat Toothache, and genre experimentation (2020–2022)\n\nFollowing the release of *Hollywood's Bleeding* in 2019, Post Malone entered a period of reduced activity, stepping back from extensive touring to address burnout and pursue sobriety, which influenced his subsequent musical output. This hiatus allowed for selective collaborations that highlighted his adaptability across genres, including a feature on Justin Bieber's \"Forever\" alongside Clever, which reached number 24 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 2020. In April 2020, he hosted a livestream tribute to Nirvana, performing rock covers to raise funds for COVID-19 relief, signaling an early pivot toward rock influences amid the pandemic.\n\nIn 2021, Post Malone released the single \"Motley Crew,\" featuring cameos in its music video from rock figures like Mötley Crüe's Tommy Lee, underscoring his growing affinity for hard rock elements within hip-hop frameworks. The track's production by Louis Bell and David Doman emphasized bass-heavy beats with a gritty edge, achieving significant streaming traction despite limited traditional radio support. Further collaborations, such as \"One Right Now\" with the Kid Laroi, maintained pop-rap appeal, while overtures from indie acts like Fleet Foxes—initially considered for their 2020 album *Shore*—materialized in joint work with Robin Pecknold.\n\nThese efforts culminated in the June 3, 2022, release of *Twelve Carat Toothache*, his fourth studio album, which integrated rock and pop sensibilities through producers like Andrew Watt, known for work with Ozzy Osbourne and Guns N' Roses. Tracks such as \"Wrapped Around Your Finger,\" co-produced by Watt, Omer Fedi, and Louis Bell, featured prominent guitar riffs, diverging from pure rap structures. The album's themes of addiction and recovery, reflected in songs like \"Love/Hate Letter to Alcohol\" with Pecknold's harmonies evoking sobriety's calm contrast to Post Malone's raw verses, demonstrated a causal link between personal sobriety and sonic experimentation.\n\nThis phase marked a deliberate expansion beyond hip-hop confines, with guitar-driven compositions challenging expectations of rap authenticity while sustaining commercial viability through streaming platforms, where Post Malone's catalog amassed billions of plays. Empirical metrics showed sustained listener engagement, as *Twelve Carat Toothache* debuted atop charts, propelled by features from Doja Cat and Roddy Ricch, yet distinguished by its rock-leaning production that prioritized instrumental depth over formulaic beats. Such versatility underscored a creative rejection of genre silos, rooted in broad influences rather than market-driven conformity.\n\n### Country transition: Austin, F-1 Trillion, and recent releases (2023–2025)\n\nIn 2023, Post Malone released his fifth studio album, *Austin*, on July 28, comprising 17 tracks that marked an initial pivot toward rock and folk influences amid his broader genre experimentation. While not exclusively country, the self-titled project—drawing from his birth name, Austin Richard Post—reflected his Texas origins, with songs like \"Something Real\" and \"Chemical\" incorporating acoustic elements and themes of personal reflection that foreshadowed deeper country leanings. This release followed sessions in Nashville, where Post Malone immersed himself in the local music ecosystem, building on his childhood exposure to country via his father's record collection and North Texas upbringing in Grapevine.\n\nThe full embrace of country arrived with *F-1 Trillion*, Post Malone's sixth studio album, released on August 16, 2024, via Mercury Records/Republic Records in partnership with Big Loud. Featuring 18 tracks with collaborations from established country figures including Blake Shelton on \"Pour Me a Drink,\" Dolly Parton, Morgan Wallen on the No. 1 Hot 100 single \"I Had Some Help,\" Hank Williams Jr., Tim McGraw, Jelly Roll, and Lainey Wilson, the album debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 with the second-largest opening week for a country album in 2024. A surprise deluxe edition, *F-1 Trillion: Long Bed*, added nine solo country tracks hours later, emphasizing his unassisted songwriting and performance capabilities. Post Malone handled creative direction, with the surreal cover art—a pickup truck hovering over a lake—photographed by Gonzalo Lebrija. This Nashville-centric production, rooted in years of informal country covers and regional affinity rather than abrupt reinvention, yielded sustained streaming success and countered skepticism by prioritizing traditional instrumentation like steel guitar and fiddle alongside his signature melodic hooks.\n\nPost Malone's country pivot gained institutional validation through milestones like his Grand Ole Opry debut on August 14, 2024, where he performed with Vince Gill, Brad Paisley, Lainey Wilson, and John Michael Montgomery, earning standing ovations for tracks from *F-1 Trillion*. In 2025, the album secured a Country Music Association (CMA) Awards nomination for Album of the Year, alongside five Academy of Country Music (ACM) nods, while Grammy nominations included Best Country Song and Best Country Solo Performance for \"A Bar Song (Tipsy).\" He headlined Coachella in April 2025, delivering an emotional set blending country-rap hybrids that drew from his hybrid style. The Big Ass Stadium Tour expanded this evolution, with 2025 dates at venues like Rice-Eccles Stadium in Salt Lake City (April 29) and Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas (May 3), plus international stops in Abu Dhabi (December 5) and Guwahati, India (December 8), sustaining his cross-genre appeal amid billions of cumulative streams that defied purist genre boundaries.\n\n## Musical style and influences\n\n### Genre blending and evolution\n\nPost Malone's early music featured a synthesis of hip-hop and melodic elements, characterized by heavy use of Auto-Tune on his baritone vocals over trap beats, creating rap-sung hybrids that prioritized emotional delivery over strict rhythmic flows. On his 2016 debut album *Stoney*, tracks like \"Congratulations\" combined melodic choruses with sparse, atmospheric production, blending trap percussion with pop accessibility to evoke vulnerability amid bravado. This approach fused hip-hop's rhythmic drive with rock-influenced guitar tones and folk-like introspection, as evident in the production's emphasis on reverb-heavy vocals and 808 bass, which mechanically broadened appeal by layering introspective lyrics over universally resonant hooks.\n\nHis style evolved across albums, shifting from hip-hop dominance to greater rock integration in *Twelve Carat Toothache* (2022), where tracks incorporated acoustic folk-rock riffs and electric guitar solos alongside residual trap elements, such as the opening riff in \"Waiting for Never\" that transitions into 808 drums. By *F-1 Trillion* (2024), the blending pivoted to acoustic country instrumentation, with banjo and pedal steel guitar underscoring baritone laments in songs like \"I Had Some Help,\" evolving trap-melody foundations into twangy narratives while retaining his signature vocal timbre for continuity. This progression reflects a barrier-breaking synthesis, where production choices—like layering melodic Auto-Tune over genre-specific beats—causally enabled crossover by hybridizing sonic textures that evoke shared emotional states across listener demographics, rather than adhering to siloed conventions.\n\nMalone has explicitly rejected genre boundaries, stating in 2018, \"If a song makes you feel nice or it makes you feel sad or if it makes you feel anything, what does it really matter what category it is?\" This philosophy drove his evolution from *Stoney*'s hip-hop base to rock-infused experimentation and country authenticity, guided by personal affinity rather than commercial pivots. Empirical indicators of this approach's efficacy include his unprecedented achievement as the first artist with simultaneous number-one albums on Billboard's Top Country, Top Rap, and Top Rock charts, alongside Spotify data showing country tracks like those from *F-1 Trillion* comprising multiple entries in the platform's global top 50, demonstrating broadened playlist penetration through emotionally universal fusions that transcend cultural gatekeeping.\n\n### Key influences and production techniques\n\nPost Malone has frequently cited **Kurt Cobain** of Nirvana as a primary influence for the raw emotional delivery in his vocal performances and songwriting, evident in his tattoos referencing Nirvana's *Nevermind* album and phrases like \"Whatever.\" He has also drawn from **Johnny Cash**'s narrative-driven storytelling and minimalist country-folk structures, which inform his lyrical introspection on themes of fame and personal struggle. Additionally, **Kanye West**'s innovative sampling and genre-blending production impacted Malone's approach to integrating hip-hop elements with melodic hooks, as acknowledged in early interviews where West was listed among rap influences alongside 50 Cent.\n\nHis foundational exposure stemmed from his father, Rich Post, who introduced him to a diverse array of records spanning classic rock, metal, and hip-hop during childhood in Texas, fostering an autodidactic ear for melody and rhythm without formal training. This home environment emphasized experimentation over institutional gatekeeping, aligning with broader shifts where accessible digital audio workstations (DAWs) like FL Studio democratized production for non-elite creators, allowing Malone to prototype tracks independently before professional refinement.\n\nIn production, Malone employs techniques such as stacking distorted electric guitars and acoustic layers atop deep 808 bass kicks and trap hi-hats, creating a hybrid texture that contrasts melodic vulnerability with rhythmic aggression. He often begins in home studios using plugins for rapid iteration—processing vocals with Auto-Tune for pitch correction while preserving natural timbre, and layering harmonies for density—before collaborating with producer Louis Bell to achieve gritty yet radio-polished mixes via Pro Tools, as seen in tracks like \"Circles\" where Bell handled drum arrangements and spatial effects. This self-reliant workflow, rooted in software affordability and plugin versatility, underscores how technological accessibility bypassed traditional studio barriers, enabling Malone's outsider ascent through verifiable trial-and-error rather than credentialed expertise.\n\n## Public reception and impact\n\n### Commercial achievements and chart success\n\nPost Malone has amassed over 50 billion total streams across all credits on Spotify as of July 2025. His lead streams alone exceed 47 billion, ranking him among the platform's most-streamed artists historically. These figures underscore his sustained digital dominance, driven by hits spanning hip-hop, pop, and country genres.\n\nHe holds the record for the most RIAA Diamond-certified singles by any artist, with nine such certifications as of 2024, surpassing combined totals from rappers like Eminem (three) and Drake (five). This includes \"Sunflower\" (with Swae Lee), the first single to achieve Double Diamond status at 20 million units, which also became the most-streamed song in U.S. history with nearly 4 billion on-demand streams. \"Sunflower\" further set a benchmark by logging the most weeks on Billboard's Streaming Songs chart at over 123.\n\nAll of Post Malone's major-label albums since *Beerbongs \\u0026 Bentleys* (2018) have debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, including *Hollywood's Bleeding* (2019), *Twelve Carat Toothache* (2022), *Austin* (2023), and *F-1 Trillion* (2024), the latter earning 250,000 equivalent album units in its first week—among the year's strongest debuts for a country album. His genre shift to country with *F-1 Trillion* yielded sales rivaling pop contemporaries, bolstered by 212.86 million on-demand streams in the opening frame.\n\nTouring has generated box office equivalents exceeding $100 million for select runs, such as the Big Ass Stadium Tour (2025), his first to cross that threshold. The F-1 Trillion Tour (2024) grossed $63 million from 470,000 tickets sold across 25 North American shows, averaging $2.5 million per performance. These metrics reflect broad commercial appeal, with RIAA accolades extending to multi-platinum albums and singles that transcend genre niches.\n\n### Critical acclaim and cultural significance\n\nPost Malone has received praise from music critics for his melodic versatility and emotional depth in songwriting, particularly in addressing themes of vulnerability and personal struggle such as addiction. Reviewers have highlighted his ability to convey raw introspection through lyrics that resonate universally, as seen in tracks exploring substance dependency and emotional isolation, which draw from his own experiences with alcohol abuse. His vocal delivery, characterized by a range that supports both introspective crooning and higher belted notes, contributes to this acclaim by allowing fluid transitions across styles without relying on genre constraints.\n\nIn the streaming era, Post Malone's genre-blending approach—merging hip-hop, pop, rock, and later country elements—has positioned him as a catalyst for cross-cultural musical dialogue, enabling broader accessibility beyond traditional rap audiences. This fluidity reflects a listener-driven model where appeal stems from catchy hooks and relatable narratives rather than rigid stylistic boundaries, influencing subsequent artists to experiment similarly. His work challenges entrenched industry norms by demonstrating that artistic merit, evidenced by sustained listener engagement across platforms, can transcend identity-based expectations in hip-hop and adjacent genres.\n\nPost Malone's cultural footprint extends to fostering diverse fan engagement, with listener data indicating a broad demographic span including older age groups (50-64 at 20% and 75+ at 7%) that defies hip-hop's conventional exclusivity. By openly discussing his path toward responsible habits post-alcohol struggles, particularly after fatherhood in 2022, he promotes narratives of personal accountability that resonate with younger audiences navigating similar pressures, emphasizing self-reliance over performative excess. This DIY ethos, rooted in his early independent uploads leading to viral breakthroughs, underscores a meritocratic ascent in an industry often critiqued for favoring networked insiders.\n\n### Criticisms and debates over authenticity\n\nPost Malone faced early criticisms regarding his authenticity in hip-hop, particularly as a white artist entering a genre historically dominated by Black creators, with detractors labeling him a \"culture vulture\" for adopting stylistic elements like trap beats and Auto-Tune without perceived cultural ties. This scrutiny peaked around 2017-2018 following hits like \"Rockstar,\" where he acknowledged the pressure, stating in interviews that it contributed to his heavy drinking as a coping mechanism. Critics argued his suburban Texas upbringing and gaming background undermined claims to hip-hop legitimacy, viewing his SoundCloud-viral rise with \"White Iverson\" in 2015 as opportunistic rather than organic.\n\nSome outlets and commentators dismissed his delivery as akin to \"mumble rap,\" citing slurred, Auto-Tune-heavy flows in tracks from *Stoney* (2016) as lacking technical rap skill or lyrical depth. However, analyses of his discography reveal clear diction and melodic phrasing distinct from contemporaries like Lil Uzi Vert or Playboi Carti, with sustained chart performance—such as \"Congratulations\" holding Billboard Hot 100 positions for 56 weeks—demonstrating listener appeal beyond fleeting trends. His refusal to self-identify strictly as a rapper, emphasizing genre-blending from inception, further fueled debates, as purists contended this diluted hip-hop's core while he maintained it reflected personal expression over genre gatekeeping.\n\nPost Malone's pivot toward country music, evident in *F-1 Trillion* (2024) which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, drew accusations of a \"cash-grab\" from hip-hop loyalists who saw it as abandoning the genre that launched him for broader commercial appeal in Nashville's lucrative market. Detractors highlighted the shift's timing amid rap's saturation, suggesting inauthenticity given his prior success metrics like over 70 billion global streams. Yet, this evolution traces to pre-fame roots: Raised in Grapevine, Texas, he cited influences like Johnny Cash and Dwight Yoakam from adolescence, performing country covers such as \"Take Me Home, Country Roads\" as early as 2015 and incorporating twang in tracks like \"Whiskey Glasses\" from 2017. Empirical indicators counter dilution claims, including cross-genre fan retention—evidenced by *F-1 Trillion*'s immediate sales parity with prior albums—and expanded youth engagement in country, as Nashville insiders noted his Opry performances revitalizing audiences without diluting output quality. This pattern of sustained innovation, rather than reactive trend-chasing, underscores a career driven by intrinsic musical preferences over external validation.\n\n## Controversies\n\n### Accusations of cultural appropriation in hip-hop\n\nPost Malone encountered accusations of cultural appropriation in hip-hop following the 2015 release of his debut single \"White Iverson,\" with criticisms escalating in 2017 amid his commercial breakthrough. Detractors, including in a Complex magazine article by Shawn Setaro, contended that as a white artist from a privileged background, Malone profited from black-originated musical elements—such as trap beats, auto-tune flows, and lyrical themes of excess—without bearing the historical or social \"burdens\" associated with the genre's development in marginalized communities. These claims portrayed his adoption of hip-hop aesthetics, alongside displays of luxury like diamond grills and high-end vehicles, as exploitative, echoing broader debates over white artists \"vulturing\" black culture for gain while evading its struggles.\n\nIn response, Malone has consistently defended his work as rooted in genuine fandom rather than opportunism, stating in a November 2017 video that he does not \"take advantage\" of hip-hop and appreciates it deeply, dismissing the accusations as misunderstandings of his broad influences across genres and demographics.  Empirical evidence of mutual respect includes his collaborations with black hip-hop artists, such as the 2017 platinum-certified \"rockstar\" with 21 Savage, which debuted at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, and tracks with Travis Scott and Young Thug, indicating voluntary artistic partnerships driven by shared creative goals rather than one-sided extraction. In a 2024 CBS interview, Malone reflected that early \"culture vulture\" labels pained him, contributing to personal struggles like increased alcohol use, but affirmed his genre-agnostic approach from inception, predating hip-hop fame with folk and rock experiments.\n\nSuch backlash, often amplified in media outlets with incentives to frame cultural exchange through lenses of racial grievance, overlooks causal realities of genre evolution: hip-hop, like rock 'n' roll before it, advanced via cross-cultural borrowing, as seen with Elvis Presley's 1950s adaptation of black blues and gospel rhythms into mainstream appeal without equivalent modern ostracism. Malone's ascent—marked by over 80 million album-equivalent units sold by 2020 and consistent chart dominance—stems from market-validated talent and melodic innovation, not appropriation, with audiences transcending racial tribalism to reward accessible artistry. Critics' emphasis on \"authenticity\" as racial exclusivity prioritizes identity gatekeeping over empirical success metrics, where black artists like Swae Lee have themselves collaborated profitably, underscoring that voluntary exchange, not imposed burdens, defines legitimate participation.\n\n### Public statements and media backlash\n\nIn a November 2017 interview with Polish outlet NewOnce, Post Malone stated that contemporary hip-hop lacked emotional depth for introspection, remarking, \"If you're looking for lyrics, if you're looking to cry, if you're looking to think about life, don't listen to hip-hop,\" while positioning the genre as suited for partying rather than profound reflection. This comment, which he attributed partly to his own emotional expressiveness as a white artist, sparked widespread backlash on social media platforms including Twitter, where critics accused him of disrespecting hip-hop culture and revealing inauthenticity in his rap persona.  Post Malone clarified in a subsequent video statement that his remarks reflected personal taste in current trends rather than a blanket dismissal of hip-hop's history or potential, emphasizing, \"There's great hip-hop being made every day,\" and noting his intent was not to undermine the genre but to highlight its escapist appeal for him. The controversy subsided as he continued collaborations with hip-hop artists like 21 Savage and Ty Dolla Sign, underscoring the statement as an individual perspective amid his rising crossover success rather than a rejection of rap's validity.\n\nFollowing a negative review of his inaugural Posty Fest in October 2018, published by Washington Post critic Jeff Weiss, which described the event's music as \"dead-eyed and ignorant\" and emblematic of materialism without creativity, Post Malone and his father, Rich Post, publicly urged fans via Twitter to target Weiss with harassment, including doxxing attempts and insults.  This response highlighted a defensive posture amid the artist's swift ascent to stardom, with Post Malone tweeting derogatory terms at the critic, though no formal legal action ensued and the online campaign fizzled without broader escalation. The incident drew secondary criticism for encouraging mob behavior against media scrutiny, yet it reflected raw frustration from an unseasoned performer facing pointed artistic dismissal at a self-curated event featuring guests like Travis Scott.\n\nPost Malone's pivot toward country music, evident in releases like the August 2024 album *F-1 Trillion* and collaborations with artists such as Blake Shelton, elicited accusations from some hip-hop adherents of abandoning rap origins for commercial gain, framing the shift as disloyalty despite his Grapevine, Texas upbringing steeped in country radio exposure from age 10. His November 2024 CMA Awards performance of \"I Had Some Help\" with Chris Stapleton faced vocal online derision for vocal strain and perceived inauthenticity, with detractors labeling it \"awful\" and questioning his genre transition's sincerity.  Such reactions overlook documented affinities, including early covers of Hank Williams Jr. and Johnny Cash, positioning the move as organic evolution driven by personal roots over rigid genre fealty, a stance that prioritizes artistic autonomy amid evolving tastes rather than perpetual allegiance to initial breakthroughs.\n\n### Legal disputes and personal conflicts\n\nIn October 2025, Larry Deuel, a Utah-based limo driver and teacher, filed a civil lawsuit against Post Malone and collaborator Tyla Yaweh in Utah's Fourth District Court, alleging breach of contract, fraudulent inducement, and misappropriation of name and likeness stemming from Deuel's unpaid cameo in the 2020 music video for the track \"Tommy Lee,\" filmed at Malone's ranch. Deuel claims he was induced to provide chauffeuring services and appear on camera with promises of substantial compensation and residuals, but received nothing despite the video's commercial success, and is seeking at least $2.5 million in principal damages plus $7.5 million in punitive damages. The complaint details Deuel's August 8, 2025, attempt to deliver a demand letter to Malone's Utah residence, where security personnel reportedly laughed, refused service, and rebuffed him.\n\nPost Malone has encountered few other high-profile legal disputes over compensation in creative endeavors. In 2019, songwriter Tyler Armes sued Malone for copyright infringement on the hit \"Circles,\" asserting he co-wrote elements of the track during sessions but was denied credit and royalties; the case settled in March 2023 prior to trial, with no admission of wrongdoing by Malone. No criminal convictions have arisen from these or related personal conflicts, and the disputes—often involving unverified verbal agreements in informal production settings—have empirically low rates of judicial resolution in claimants' favor, consistent with patterns where celebrity status attracts unsubstantiated civil claims seeking leverage through publicity rather than proven merit.\n\n## Business ventures\n\n### Fashion and apparel lines\n\nPost Malone, under his birth name Austin Richard Post, established the apparel label Austin Post in 2025 as a dedicated fashion venture distinct from his music merchandising. The brand's inaugural presentation occurred on September 1, 2025, with a runway show titled \"Austin Post in Paris\" held at the former residence of Karl Lagerfeld in Paris, featuring Western-themed elements such as denim-on-denim ensembles, velvet jackets, and a live horse on the runway to evoke ranch-style aesthetics. This debut emphasized craftsmanship in materials like flannel plaids and boots, drawing from Americana influences aligned with Post's relocation to Texas during his youth and his affinity for cowboy motifs.\n\nThe label's first ready-to-wear offering, The Permanent Collection, launched for online sale on October 23, 2025, at 8:00 a.m. PST via the official website austin-post.com, comprising items such as shirts, outerwear, and accessories priced for direct consumer access. This collection incorporates collaborations, including Lucchese boots in styles like the Luke model with barnwood and tan finishes, positioning the line as a blend of traditional Western wear with contemporary functionality. Available in select sizes with options for free delivery and returns on qualifying purchases, the assortment reflects Post's intent to create enduring, self-sustaining apparel independent of his recording career revenue streams.\n\n### Other entrepreneurial activities\n\nIn 2019, Post Malone launched Maison No. 9, a rosé wine brand produced in partnership with a French winery, featuring a blend of Grenache Noir, Cinsault, Syrah, and Merlot grapes. The wine, priced at approximately $22 per 750ml bottle, emphasizes a crisp, light-bodied profile with notes of strawberries, peach, and citrus, reflecting Malone's personal affinity for Mediterranean-style rosés. This venture marked his entry into the beverage alcohol market, distinct from his music career, and has been distributed nationally through retailers like Total Wine.\n\nThat same year, Malone announced plans to enter the cannabis industry with Shaboink, a company focused on producing flower, pre-rolled joints, and vaporizers. He subsequently partnered with breeder Mario Guzman of Sherbinskis and Icon Farms to release American-grown hemp pre-rolls under the American Hemp banner, capitalizing on legal hemp markets amid his expressed interest in cannabis products. These initiatives positioned Malone in the emerging hemp and cannabis sectors, aligning with broader diversification strategies to mitigate risks in the volatile music industry.\n\nIn August 2020, Malone acquired an undisclosed equity stake in Envy Gaming, a Texas-based esports organization owning teams like Dallas Empire and Dallas Fuel, becoming a co-owner. This investment stemmed from his longstanding enthusiasm for gaming, including collectible card games and streaming, and contributed to Envy's subsequent $40 million funding round. Through social media promotion, Malone leveraged his platform to boost the organization's visibility in competitive gaming circuits.\n\nIn 2021, Electric Feel Ventures, the investment arm tied to Malone's management team, participated in a $2.3 million funding round for Actual Veggies, a plant-based burger startup emphasizing whole vegetable patties without isolates. This move supported innovation in vegan food technology, with Malone's involvement highlighted in announcements alongside other celebrity backers.\n\n## Personal life\n\n### Health challenges and recovery\n\nPost Malone's ascent to fame in the mid-2010s coincided with escalating substance use, primarily alcohol, as a coping mechanism for the pressures of constant touring, public scrutiny, and social isolation. He has described blacking out frequently and consuming excessive amounts daily, leading to physical dependency where he \"couldn't get up off the floor for weeks\" during acute episodes.  This pattern, rooted in overwork rather than inherent glorification of excess, contributed to gastrointestinal distress and broader health decline, as chronic heavy drinking impairs digestive function and immune response.\n\nIn September 2022, Post Malone suffered a fall during a concert in St. Louis on September 17, resulting in bruised ribs, followed by hospitalization on September 24 for stabbing pain and severe breathing difficulties that forced cancellation of a Boston show.  The incident highlighted vulnerabilities from his high-risk performance schedule and prior substance-related physical toll, with shallow breathing from pain risking secondary complications like pneumonia, though not explicitly diagnosed.\n\nRecovery efforts intensified around 2022, coinciding with reflections in his album *Twelve Carat Toothache*, where he addressed alcohol's grip without pursuing total abstinence. Instead, he shifted to moderated consumption—\"I'm not sober... I'm responsible now\"—via self-imposed limits, routine adjustments, and accountability, crediting his fiancée's intervention for pulling him from rock bottom.   Fatherhood, following the birth of his daughter in 2022, further anchored this stability, prompting cleaner eating and reduced intake that yielded empirical benefits like 55 pounds of weight loss by 2023. \n\nBy 2025, Post Malone maintained physical and mental steadiness, reporting \"happy and in good health\" amid fan concerns over his transformed appearance, attributing it to sustainable lifestyle changes rather than relapse. Plans to decelerate after a demanding 2024 underscored resilience factors like family support—evident in resolved custody matters with his daughter's mother—and intentional pacing to mitigate prior isolation-driven excesses.  This trajectory demonstrates causal realism in recovery: external pressures fueled abuse, but personal agency and relational buffers enabled managed equilibrium without idealized sobriety myths.\n\n### Tattoos, appearance, and lifestyle\n\nPost Malone possesses over 70 tattoos across his body, with at least 14 located on his face, encompassing portraits of figures like Kurt Cobain and Lil Peep, as well as symbolic elements such as weapons and skulls. His facial ink includes the phrase \"Always Tired\" scripted beneath his eyes, acquired in June 2018 to convey chronic fatigue from intensive work schedules and touring demands. Additional designs feature barbed wire encircling his eyes and medieval weaponry like a gauntlet and flail added in 2020, referencing aesthetics from his music videos.  \n\nThese tattoos, particularly the facial ones, stem from Malone's intent to reject mainstream beauty norms and evade superficial judgments in the entertainment industry, prioritizing unfiltered self-presentation over commercial appeal. Critics have occasionally dismissed his inked appearance as contrived, yet consistent documentation of his body art evolution since early career stages, including arm pieces like Texas flag skulls honoring his upbringing, underscores genuine expression unbound by genre conventions. His overall style blends rugged casual wear with prominent dental grills and visible modifications, aligning with a persona that favors authenticity amid celebrity pressures.  \n\nIn lifestyle, Malone exhibits a strong interest in firearms, regularly engaging in shooting range visits and tactical training, as shown in sessions at facilities like Viktos in 2018. This hobby ties into his collection of weaponry-themed tattoos and public endorsements of gun culture without overt advocacy. He resides in a fortified Utah property equipped as a self-sustaining bunker with amenities including a gym and pool, reflecting preparation for isolation amid fame's intrusions. Despite high-profile success, he sustains a subdued routine incorporating gaming and occasional explorations like a 2021 visit to Skinwalker Ranch, prioritizing privacy and personal diversions over extravagant displays.\n\n### Political and philosophical views\n\nPost Malone has expressed profound distrust toward the U.S. government, describing it in a 2018 interview as \"the biggest lie in the world.\" He elaborated that societal collapse or martial law could occur, advising individuals to relocate to rural areas, achieve self-sufficiency by growing food and purifying water, and remain vigilant rather than relying on institutional assurances. This perspective underscores a philosophical emphasis on personal preparedness and skepticism of centralized authority, prioritizing empirical self-reliance over collective dependence.\n\nHis support for the Second Amendment reflects a commitment to individual liberty amid perceived global instability. In 2017, Malone affirmed his ownership of multiple firearms, likening his collection to military-grade arsenals and stating that \"the entire world is going to shit,\" which necessitates armed self-defense. As an NRA member who selected his Utah residence partly for its permissive gun laws, he has integrated pro-gun themes into his lyrics and public persona, viewing firearm ownership as a pragmatic counter to potential threats rather than a partisan stance.\n\nMalone maintains neutrality on political parties, avoiding explicit endorsements while exhibiting views aligned with anti-establishment realism, such as admiration for self-made success and wariness of expansive government. A tattoo of John F. Kennedy on his right forearm symbolizes this outlook, as Malone has cited JFK as an exemplar of authentic Americanism who challenged hidden power structures. His 2024 shift toward country music parallels broader cultural trends favoring populist, grounded narratives of independence, though he frames it as artistic evolution rather than ideological alignment. These positions counter portrayals of his work as mere escapism, revealing instead a focus on causal realities like institutional fragility and personal agency.\n\n### Religious beliefs and evolution\n\nPost Malone was raised in a Christian household in Dallas, Texas, following his family's relocation there when he was nine years old, with regular church attendance shaping his early environment. In his youth, he described himself as \"super-religious,\" expressing a firm belief in God during that period.\n\nFollowing his rise to fame in the mid-2010s, Malone articulated a significant shift in his worldview, stating in a 2017 interview that he had come to \"see through\" organized religion, critiquing its institutional aspects such as financial exploitation by religious figures. This evolution appeared tied to personal experiences, including the excesses of success and struggles with addiction, which prompted a rejection of dogmatic piety in favor of independent reasoning about existence. By 2014, he had identified as Christian but expressed confusion over biblical interpretation due to its archaic language, indicating early doubts even before peak fame.\n\nIn more recent statements, Malone has rejected strict religiosity while affirming a belief in a higher power, describing himself as spiritually attuned but not adherent to formal doctrines. He noted a prior \"atheist, agnostic mindset\" that softened after fatherhood in 2020, with his daughter's birth fostering greater openness to spiritual concepts amid ongoing personal challenges like substance dependency. His lyrics, such as those in tracks addressing loss and self-blame, reflect introspective grappling with addiction's toll rather than overt proselytizing or theological endorsement, emphasizing individual accountability over communal faith structures. This trajectory underscores a causal progression from enforced early piety to a realist agnosticism grounded in life's empirical trials, prioritizing personal growth devoid of institutional intermediaries.\n\n## Performing arts\n\n### Tours and live performances\n\nPost Malone's live performances evolved from club shows and festivals in the mid-2010s to large-scale arena and stadium headline tours by the 2020s, characterized by high-energy deliveries blending rock-infused guitar solos, rap flows, and increasingly country-leaning arrangements tailored to venue intimacy. Early sets emphasized spectacle with pyrotechnics and crowd interaction, while later country adaptations featured acoustic elements and collaborations, as seen in transitions from rap-heavy spectacles to more narrative-driven shows supporting genre shifts.\n\nHis breakthrough arena outing, the Runaway Tour, supported the 2019 album *Hollywood's Bleeding* and ran from September 14, 2019, in Tacoma, Washington, to March 12, 2020, in Denver, Colorado, across 48 dates in North America, grossing over $50 million and averaging 15,000 attendees per show with high sell-out rates. The production included elaborate staging and guests like Swae Lee, drawing praise for elevating his concert draw amid rising popularity.\n\nIn 2025, Post Malone escalated to stadiums with the Big Ass Stadium Tour, commencing April 29 in Salt Lake City, Utah, and spanning 25 dates across the US and Canada, co-headlined with Jelly Roll and concluding with international extensions. This trek, tied to his *F-1 Trillion* album, became his highest-grossing and most-attended North American run, featuring sold-out venues like AT\\u0026T Stadium on May 9 and emphasizing genre-blending sets with over 20 songs per night. Global expansion included headline slots at Etihad Park in Abu Dhabi on December 5 and Khanapara Veterinary Ground in Guwahati, India, on December 8, broadening his reach beyond North America.\n\nFestival appearances underscored his versatility, including a headlining debut at Coachella in April 2025 across both weekends, where sets mixed hits like \"Circles,\" \"Psycho,\" and \"I Had Some Help\" with high-energy guitar work and guest appearances, drawing crowds of approximately 100,000 per night and earning acclaim for sincere, explosive delivery.  He was announced as a headliner for Stagecoach Festival on April 26, 2026, alongside Lainey Wilson and Cody Johnson, signaling continued pivot toward country audiences in a 75,000-capacity event.\n\n### Filmography and media roles\n\nPost Malone has undertaken a limited number of acting roles, primarily cameos and voice work in films, reflecting his prioritization of music over extensive screen pursuits. His debut in feature films came with a voice cameo as a Brooklyn bystander in the animated *Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse* (2018), where he delivered a brief line amid the chaos of a multiverse battle. He followed this with a small part as a truck robber in the action thriller *Wrath of Man* (2021), directed by Guy Ritchie, in which his character is swiftly dispatched during a heist sequence opposite Jason Statham.\n\nSubsequent appearances include a cameo in *Spenser Confidential* (2020), a Netflix action film starring Mark Wahlberg, and a role as an enforcer named Carter in the *Road House* remake (2024), where he engages in physical confrontations as part of a bouncer crew led by Jake Gyllenhaal. In animation, he voiced the mutant fish character Ray Fillet in episodes of the *Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles* series (2024) and contributed to *Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem* (2023). Upcoming projects feature him as DJ Omar Gosh in *Happy Gilmore 2* (2025), a sequel to the 1996 comedy, signaling continued minor forays into live-action comedy.\n\n| Year | Title | Role | Notes |\n|------|--------|------|-------|\n| 2018 | *Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse* | Brooklyn Bystander (voice) | Animated cameo |\n| 2020 | *Spenser Confidential* | Cameo | Action film |\n| 2021 | *Wrath of Man* | Truck Robber | Heist thriller cameo |\n| 2023 | *Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem* | Voice role | Animation |\n| 2024 | *Road House* | Carter | Remake, enforcer role |\n| 2024 | *Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles* (TV series) | Ray Fillet (voice) | Animated episodes |\n| 2025 | *Happy Gilmore 2* | DJ Omar Gosh | Comedy sequel |\n\nIn television and media, Post Malone has appeared as a musical performer on shows like *Saturday Night Live*, including a notable 2022 tribute performance fronting surviving Nirvana members for the band's 50th anniversary special, though he has not hosted the program. He is scheduled to perform on the 2026 edition of *Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve with Ryan Seacrest*. He also featured in the documentary *Runaway* (2022), which premiered on Amazon Prime Video's Freevee channel and chronicled aspects of his career and personal struggles. Beyond scripted roles, he maintains an active presence in gaming media, streaming on Twitch under the handle PostMalone since at least 2017, where he broadcasts sessions of titles like *Call of Duty: Warzone*, *Hunt: Showdown*, and *PUBG*, amassing peak viewerships exceeding 20,000 and engaging fans through casual, high-energy play. These streams underscore his versatility in digital media, blending entertainment with interactive fan engagement outside traditional acting.\n## Discography\n\n### Studio albums\n\nPost Malone's debut studio album, *Stoney*, was released on December 9, 2016, by Republic Records.
