Situated between the Pacific Ocean and the Coast Mountains, it is one of the most populous and culturally diverse cities in Canada, often celebrated for its natural beauty, mild climate, and high quality of life. As a key economic hub, Vancouver serves as a center for trade, film production, and technology, while also being a popular destination for tourists and immigrants alike. With a population of approximately 662,000 as of 2021 within the city proper, and over 2.6 million in the Greater Vancouver metropolitan area, it ranks as the third-largest metropolitan area in Canada [Statistics Canada](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/en/subjects-start/population_and_demography).\n\n## Historical Background\n\nVancouver's history stretches back thousands of years, with the region originally inhabited by Indigenous peoples, including the Musqueam, Squamish, and Tsleil-Waututh First Nations, collectively known as the Coast Salish peoples. Archaeological evidence suggests human presence in the area dating back at least 8,000 to 10,000 years [Musqueam First Nation](https://www.musqueam.bc.ca/our-history/).\n\nEuropean exploration of the region began in the late 18th century, with Spanish and British expeditions mapping the coastline. The city itself was incorporated on April 6, 1886, following the arrival of the Canadian Pacific Railway, which established Vancouver as a critical transcontinental link. Named after British naval officer Captain George Vancouver, who explored the area in 1792, the city rapidly grew due to its strategic location as a port and railway terminus [City of Vancouver Archives](https://vancouver.ca/your-government/city-archives.aspx).\n\nDuring the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Vancouver became a hub for logging, fishing, and shipping industries. It also faced challenges, including anti-Asian riots in 1907 and economic struggles during the Great Depression. Post-World War II, the city experienced significant urban expansion and diversification, becoming a gateway for immigration from Asia, particularly after the 1960s [ UBC Library - Vancouver History](https://guides.library.ubc.ca/vancouverhistory).\n\n## Current Status and Relevance\n\nToday, Vancouver is a global city with a strong economy driven by sectors such as trade, tourism, technology, and film production—often referred to as \"Hollywood North\" due to its prominence in the entertainment industry [Creative BC](https://www.creativebc.com/). The Port of Vancouver is the largest in Canada and a critical gateway for North American trade with Asia, handling over 140 million tonnes of cargo annually [Port of Vancouver](https://www.portvancouver.com/about-us/statistics/).\n\nVancouver consistently ranks among the world's most livable cities, thanks to its access to nature, cultural amenities, and progressive urban planning. However, it also faces significant challenges, including a severe housing affordability crisis, with some of the highest real estate prices in North America, and concerns over homelessness and drug addiction, particularly in the Downtown Eastside neighborhood [The Economist Intelligence Unit](https://www.eiu.com/n/campaigns/global-liveability-index-2023/).\n\nThe city plays a pivotal role in environmental sustainability, aiming to become the \"greenest city in the world\" by 2030 through initiatives like renewable energy adoption and green building standards [City of Vancouver Greenest City Plan](https://vancouver.ca/green-vancouver/greenest-city-action-plan.aspx). Additionally, Vancouver is a cultural mosaic, with over 50% of its population identifying as a visible minority, predominantly of Asian descent, contributing to a vibrant multicultural identity [Statistics Canada - Vancouver Demographics](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2021/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CMACA&Code1=933&DGUID=2021A00055933005&Gender=1&STATISTIC=1&Header=1&SearchText=Vancouver&B1=All&TYPE=0).\n\n## Notable Facts and Details\n\n- **Geography and Climate**: Vancouver is located on the Burrard Peninsula, bordered by the Burrard Inlet to the north, the Fraser River to the south, and the Strait of Georgia to the west.
