## Introduction

Russia, officially known as the Russian Federation, is the largest country in the world by land area, spanning two continents—Eastern Europe and Northern Asia. Covering over 17.1 million square kilometers, it stretches across 11 time zones and shares borders with 14 countries, including Norway, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Belarus, Ukraine, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, China, Mongolia, and North Korea. With a population of approximately 145 million as of 2023, Russia is the ninth most populous country globally. Its capital, Moscow, serves as the political, economic, and cultural center. Russia is a federal semi-presidential republic, known for its complex history, vast natural resources, and significant geopolitical influence [CIA World Factbook](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/russia/).

Russia's landscape is diverse, encompassing Arctic tundra, vast forests, steppes, and mountain ranges such as the Urals and the Caucasus. It is home to the world's deepest freshwater lake, Lake Baikal, and possesses immense reserves of oil, natural gas, and minerals, making it a major player in global energy markets. Despite its economic and military power, Russia faces challenges including political tensions, economic sanctions, and demographic issues [BBC Russia Profile](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-17839672).

## Historical Background

### Early History and the Rise of the Rus'
The history of Russia traces back to the 9th century with the formation of the Kievan Rus', a loose federation of East Slavic tribes centered in what is now Ukraine and western Russia. Established by the Varangian prince Rurik, the Kievan Rus' adopted Byzantine Christianity in 988 under Prince Vladimir the Great, marking the beginning of Russian Orthodoxy as a cultural and spiritual foundation [Encyclopedia Britannica - Kievan Rus'](https://www.britannica.com/place/Kievan-Rus).

Following the Mongol invasion in the 13th century, the Kievan Rus' fragmented, and much of the region fell under the control of the Golden Horde. The Principality of Moscow emerged as a unifying force, eventually overthrowing Mongol rule by the late 15th century under Ivan III, who adopted the title "Tsar of All Rus'." This period marked the beginning of centralized Russian statehood [History.com - Russia Timeline](https://www.history.com/topics/russia/russia-timeline).

### Imperial Russia and Expansion
Under Peter the Great (r. 1682–1725), Russia underwent significant modernization and westernization, establishing itself as a major European power. Peter founded St. Petersburg as the new capital and expanded Russian territory through military campaigns. The Russian Empire continued to grow over the next two centuries, annexing vast territories in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and the Caucasus [Britannica - Russian Empire](https://www.britannica.com/place/Russian-Empire).

The 19th century saw internal unrest due to serfdom, economic inequality, and autocratic rule. The 1917 Russian Revolution, driven by widespread discontent and the impact of World War I, led to the abdication of Tsar Nicholas II and the eventual rise of the Bolsheviks under Vladimir Lenin. This marked the end of the Russian Empire and the birth of the Soviet Union [History.com - Russian Revolution](https://www.history.com/topics/russia/russian-revolution).

### Soviet Era and Cold War
The Soviet Union, formally established in 1922, became a global superpower under a communist system. Under Joseph Stalin, the country industrialized rapidly but at the cost of millions of lives due to purges, forced collectivization, and the Gulag system. During World War II, the Soviet Union played a pivotal role in defeating Nazi Germany, suffering immense casualties [Britannica - Soviet Union](https://www.britannica.com/place/Soviet-Union).

Post-war, the Soviet Union emerged as one of the two main protagonists in the Cold War, a period of ideological and geopolitical rivalry with the United States. The USSR led the Eastern Bloc, engaging in proxy wars, the space race (notably launching the first human, Yuri Gagarin, into space in 1961), and nuclear arms development. However, economic stagnation, political repression, and internal dissent led to its dissolution in 1991 under Mikhail Gorbachev’s policies of *glasnost* (openness) and *perestroika* (restructuring) [History.com - Cold War](https://www.history.com/topics/cold-war/cold-war-history).

### Post-Soviet Russia
Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia emerged as the largest successor state, inheriting its permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council. The 1990s were marked by economic hardship, political instability, and the rise of oligarchs during Boris Yeltsin's presidency. Vladimir Putin's ascent to power in 2000 ushered in a period of political centralization, economic recovery driven by oil and gas revenues, and a more assertive foreign policy [BBC - Russia Timeline](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-17840446).

## Current Status and Relevance

As of 2023, Russia remains a major global power, wielding significant influence through its military capabilities, energy resources, and veto power in the UN Security Council. Under President Vladimir Putin, who has been in power (as president or prime minister) since 2000, Russia has pursued policies aimed at restoring its status as a great power. However, its political system is often described as authoritarian, with limited press freedom and opposition suppression [Freedom House - Russia](https://freedomhouse.org/country/russia/freedom-world/2023).

Russia's economy is heavily reliant on energy exports, making it vulnerable to fluctuations in global oil and gas prices. Western sanctions, imposed following the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the invasion of Ukraine in 2022, have further strained its economy, leading to international isolation in many spheres [World Bank - Russia Economy](https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/russia/overview).

The ongoing conflict in Ukraine has significantly damaged Russia’s global standing, leading to widespread condemnation, additional sanctions, and a refugee crisis. It has also reshaped global alliances, with Russia strengthening ties with countries like China and India while facing opposition from NATO and the European Union [Reuters - Ukraine Conflict](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-ukraine-what-you-need-know-right-now-2023-10-01/).
