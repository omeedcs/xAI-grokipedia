  "content": "# Secularism\n\nSecularism is a philosophical and political principle advocating the separation of religious institutions from governmental and public affairs, ensuring state neutrality toward all religious beliefs while prioritizing rational, evidence-based approaches to human welfare and governance. Coined by British freethinker George Jacob Holyoake in 1851, it emphasizes promoting societal well-being through material and utilitarian means, independent of supernatural doctrines or ecclesiastical authority, and views service to others as a duty grounded in observable realities rather than faith.\n\nEmerging amid 19th-century Enlightenment influences and industrialization in Europe, secularism sought to counter the dominance of established churches in law, education, and policy, fostering individual freedoms of conscience and expression without state-imposed religious conformity. Its implementation has yielded notable advancements, such as the establishment of secular education systems that prioritize empirical inquiry, contributing to scientific progress, and legal frameworks protecting diverse beliefs from majoritarian religious pressures in pluralistic societies. However, secularism has sparked controversies, including charges of inherent bias against religion—evident in historical state atheism under communist regimes—and modern tensions where strict neutrality policies clash with cultural religious practices, sometimes exacerbating social divisions rather than resolving them, as empirical studies of European multiculturalism reveal correlations between aggressive laïcité and heightened identity-based conflicts. Defining characteristics include contextual variations, from France's exclusionary model banning religious symbols in public spaces to more inclusive Anglo-American accommodations, underscoring debates over whether true secularism demands active disbelief or mere institutional disestablishment.\n\n## Definition and Principles\n\n### Etymology and Core Concepts\n\nThe term \"secular\" derives from the Latin *saeculum*, denoting a generation, an age, or the temporal world, contrasting with eternal or spiritual realms in early Christian usage to distinguish clergy from lay matters. By the 19th century, \"secular\" had evolved to signify worldly or non-religious concerns, particularly in opposition to ecclesiastical authority. George Jacob Holyoake introduced \"secularism\" in 1851 through his publication *The Reasoner*, defining it as a system promoting human welfare via material and ethical means without reliance on religious revelation. \n\nHolyoake's secularism emphasized utilitarianism, positing that moral duties arise from observable consequences and service to others, independent of supernatural beliefs. Core to this framework is the exclusion of theological dogma from public discourse and policy, focusing instead on evidence-based reasoning applicable to all individuals regardless of faith. Unlike atheism, which denies deities, secularism as conceived by Holyoake accommodates belief while insisting on naturalistic methods for societal organization, viewing religion as a private matter unfit for state imposition.\n\nIn essence, secularism prioritizes institutional neutrality toward religion, ensuring governance derives from rational, empirical principles rather than doctrinal authority, thereby safeguarding individual freedoms in diverse societies. This approach underscores causal mechanisms in human affairs—such as economic incentives and social contracts—over faith-based explanations, aligning with a worldview grounded in verifiable outcomes.\n\n### Distinction from Related Terms\n\nSecularism, as a sociopolitical doctrine, emphasizes the neutrality of state institutions toward religion, advocating separation between governmental authority and religious bodies to prevent any creed from dominating public policy or receiving preferential treatment. This principle differs fundamentally from *atheism*, which denotes a personal conviction rejecting or lacking belief in deities, and *agnosticism*, which asserts that the existence of deities is unknowable or beyond human comprehension. Secular states can thus accommodate religious citizens who endorse institutional neutrality, whereas atheism concerns individual metaphysics and does not inherently address governance structures.\n\nUnlike *state atheism*, exemplified in the Soviet Union where the 1918 decree on separation of church and state evolved into active suppression of religion under Marxist-Leninist ideology until 1991, secularism maintains impartiality without promoting disbelief or curtailing private faith. State atheism, by contrast, positions irreligion as an official ideology, often enforcing antireligious education and confiscating religious properties, as occurred with over 80% of Orthodox churches closed by 1939.\n\n*Secular humanism* integrates secular principles with an ethical framework grounded in human reason, empirical evidence, and welfare, rejecting supernatural authority, but secularism proper remains neutral on such worldviews, permitting theistic rationalists or deists to support it without endorsing humanism's anthropocentric focus. Humanism, formalized in documents like the 1933 Humanist Manifesto, prioritizes human agency over divine, yet surveys indicate only a subset of non-religious individuals (25% identifying as atheists in 2017 UK data) align with its propositions, underscoring secularism's broader institutional scope beyond personal ethics.\n\nLaïcité, codified in France's 1905 Law on the Separation of the Churches and the State, represents an assertive form of secularism that prohibits religious symbols in public schools and civil service to ensure state visibility free from confessional influence, contrasting with accommodative secularism in the United States, where the First Amendment safeguards religious expression alongside disestablishment. This French model, rooted in Third Republic efforts to counter Catholic dominance, prioritizes freedom from religious intrusion in public spheres over protections for religious practice, leading to bans like the 2004 headscarf prohibition affecting over 1,000 students annually.\n\nAnticlericalism targets the temporal power of religious hierarchies, often through historical movements like Spain's 1931 constitution dissolving Jesuit orders, but lacks secularism's commitment to even-handed neutrality, potentially fostering bias against specific denominations rather than principled exclusion of all religion from state functions. Irreligion, encompassing non-affiliation with any faith (52% of UK respondents in 2017), describes personal detachment from organized religion but does not dictate public policy, whereas secularism operationalizes such detachment at institutional levels without mandating individual irreligiosity.\n\n## Historical Development\n\n### Ancient and Medieval Precursors\n\nIn ancient India, Emperor Ashoka of the Maurya Empire (reigned c. 268–232 BCE) promulgated edicts that promoted tolerance among diverse religious groups, including Brahmanas, Sramanas (such as Buddhists and Jains), and Ajivikas, by urging mutual respect and restraint from criticizing others' doctrines while emphasizing ethical conduct like non-violence and obedience to parents. These Rock Edicts, inscribed across his domain from modern-day Afghanistan to Bangladesh, represented an early state policy of pluralism, where royal patronage supported multiple sects without mandating adherence to one, though Ashoka's personal conversion to Buddhism after the Kalinga War (c. 261 BCE) infused the framework with Buddhist moral priorities rather than neutral secularism. Scholars debate whether this constitutes proto-secularism, as the policy subordinated tolerance to Ashoka's dhamma—a syncretic ethical code—rather than deriving from irreligious first principles, yet it marked a causal shift toward governance prioritizing administrative harmony over theological uniformity.\n\nIn ancient Greece, pre-Socratic philosophers from the 6th century BCE onward advanced naturalistic explanations for cosmic origins and phenomena, attributing change to material principles like water (Thales, c. 624–546 BCE) or the boundless apeiron (Anaximander, c. 610–546 BCE) without invoking divine intervention, thereby initiating a tradition of empirical reasoning detached from anthropomorphic mythology. This Ionian school laid foundational causal mechanisms for secular philosophy by privileging observable patterns over supernatural agency, influencing later skeptics like Pyrrho (c. 360–270 BCE) who questioned dogmatic certainties. However, these ideas coexisted within a polis culture where religion permeated civic life, including state cults and oracles, limiting their institutional impact on governance.\n\nDuring the medieval Islamic world, particularly in the Abbasid Caliphate (750–1258 CE), rationalist philosophers such as Al-Razi (Rhazes, 854–925 CE) critiqued prophetic revelation as inferior to reason and rejected miracles, advocating medicine and philosophy as autonomous pursuits free from theological oversight, while Averroes (Ibn Rushd, 1126–1198 CE) distinguished demonstrative truth in philosophy from dialectical faith, arguing for the separation of interpretive domains to avoid conflict. These efforts, amid translations of Greek texts in Baghdad's House of Wisdom (established c. 825 CE), fostered a cultural milieu where empirical science—yielding advancements in algebra, optics, and astronomy—operated with relative independence from orthodoxy, influencing European scholastics via Spain. Yet, this rationalism remained embedded in an Islamic framework, curtailed by figures like Al-Ghazali (1058–1111 CE), who subordinated philosophy to revelation, prefiguring tensions rather than achieving enduring state-religion divorce.\n\nIn early medieval Europe, secularizing strategies emerged through pragmatic distinctions between sacred and profane spheres, as seen in seventh-century Iberian, Irish, and Anglo-Saxon contexts where rulers repurposed ecclesiastical properties for lay use or invoked Roman legal precedents to limit clerical jurisdiction over temporal matters, reflecting elite maneuvers to assert control amid Christian dominance. The Investiture Controversy (1075–1122 CE) intensified this by pitting papal spiritual authority against imperial temporal claims, culminating in the Concordat of Worms (1122 CE), which delineated papal elections from lay investitures, establishing embryonic boundaries between ecclesiastical and royal powers. Figures like Roger Bacon (c. 1214–1292 CE) furthered proto-secular thought by championing experimental methods in natural philosophy, insisting on verification through observation over unquestioned authority. These developments, driven by power dynamics and Aristotelian revival, hinted at causal realism in governance but were constrained by the era's theocentric worldview.\n\n### Enlightenment Foundations\n\nThe Enlightenment, spanning roughly the late 17th to late 18th centuries, marked a pivotal intellectual movement that prioritized empirical reason, individual liberty, and skepticism toward ecclesiastical authority as bases for governance and knowledge, laying groundwork for secular principles by challenging the fusion of religious and civil power. Thinkers argued that religious belief, being a matter of personal conscience, should not coerce state policy or vice versa, promoting toleration to avert confessional strife while subordinating theology to rational inquiry. This shift was driven by observations of religious wars, such as the Thirty Years' War (1618–1648), which demonstrated the destabilizing effects of state-enforced orthodoxy, prompting proposals for institutional separation to preserve civil order.\n\nJohn Locke, in his *A Letter Concerning Toleration* published in 1689, articulated a foundational case for distinguishing ecclesiastical from civil jurisdiction, asserting that the magistrate's authority extends only to temporal goods and harms, not to souls or doctrinal purity. Locke contended that the church functions as a voluntary association for worship, incapable of wielding coercive force without corrupting its spiritual ends, and that mutual toleration among sects prevents the civil magistrate from arbitrating irreconcilable faiths, as evidenced by the divisions among princes in religious opinions akin to their secular disputes. He excluded atheists from toleration not on theological grounds but due to their presumed unreliability in oaths, reflecting a pragmatic rather than absolutist secularism rooted in social contract theory. This framework influenced subsequent constitutional designs by emphasizing consent and limited government over divine right.\n\nVoltaire, writing in the mid-18th century, extended this critique through sharp polemics against religious fanaticism and institutional privilege, advocating a deistic worldview where a rational creator exists but organized clergy wield undue political influence. In works like his *Philosophical Dictionary* (1764), he lambasted the Catholic Church's intertwinement with monarchy for fostering intolerance, as seen in his defense of Jean Calas, a Protestant executed in 1762 on fabricated charges, which galvanized campaigns for judicial reform and state impartiality toward creeds. Voltaire favored a state-established religion stripped of coercive power, prioritizing civil peace and freedom of thought over confessional uniformity, though his deism retained a providential order subordinate to human reason.\n\nCharles de Montesquieu, in *The Spirit of the Laws* (1748), analyzed how moderate governments sustain liberty through balanced powers, viewing religion as a civil utility that bolsters mores but warning against clerical dominance that erodes legal equality. He praised England's post-1688 settlement for curbing ecclesiastical overreach while noting that excessive separation could weaken moral foundations, yet insisted states assess faiths by their societal contributions rather than truth claims. Montesquieu's comparative method, drawing from historical examples like Roman tolerance, underscored causal links between institutional religion and despotism, favoring secular mechanisms like constitutional checks to mitigate fanaticism. These ideas collectively advanced secularism as a bulwark against absolutism, influencing framers of modern liberal orders by privileging empirical governance over revelation.\n\n### Modern Codification and Spread\n\nThe term \"secularism\" was coined by George Holyoake in 1851 to describe a form of freethought that emphasized ethical conduct derived from natural and social sources, independent of religious doctrine, while advocating tolerance toward religion without promoting antagonism. Holyoake, a British reformer and editor of *The Reasoner*, positioned secularism as a practical philosophy focused on this-worldly duties, contrasting it with atheism by avoiding direct denial of the supernatural. This codification emerged amid 19th-century industrialization and scientific advancements, which challenged traditional religious authority in Britain, where Holyoake faced imprisonment for blasphemy in 1842, prompting his development of a non-confrontational framework.\n\nEarly institutional embodiments appeared in the United States with the First Amendment to the Constitution, ratified on December 15, 1791, which prohibited Congress from establishing a national religion or restricting its free exercise, establishing a precedent for governmental neutrality toward religion. In France, the principle of *laïcité*—state neutrality and separation from religious institutions—was codified in the Law of Separation of the Churches and the State on December 9, 1905, which ended state funding for religious bodies, nationalized church property, and guaranteed freedom of worship while barring religious influence in public education and administration. This legislation resolved longstanding tensions from the French Revolution's dechristianization campaigns and Third Republic anticlericalism, prioritizing republican governance over Catholic dominance.\n\nSecularism spread further in the 20th century through nationalist reforms and constitutional frameworks. In Turkey, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk implemented sweeping secular policies following the 1923 founding of the republic, including the abolition of the caliphate in 1924, adoption of a secular civil code in 1926 modeled on European systems, and the 1928 constitutional amendment removing Islam as the state religion, aiming to modernize society by curtailing clerical power and promoting Western legal norms. India's 1950 Constitution embedded secular principles by ensuring equal treatment of religions, freedom of practice under Article 25, and state non-interference in religious matters, though without initially using the term \"secular\" (added to the Preamble in 1976), reflecting a model accommodating religious diversity amid partition's communal violence.\n\nIn contrast, the Soviet Union pursued militant state atheism from 1917, enacting decrees like the 1918 separation of church and state, confiscation of religious property, and anti-religious campaigns under Lenin and Stalin, which suppressed worship, closed thousands of churches, and promoted scientific atheism as ideological orthodoxy rather than neutral secular governance. By mid-century, secularism had disseminated via decolonization and international norms, influencing constitutions in countries like Mexico (1917) and Indonesia (1945, with accommodations), though implementations varied between passive tolerance and assertive exclusion, often correlating with modernization efforts and resistance to theocratic legacies.\n\n## Variations and Typologies\n\n### Passive and Assertive Models\n\nPassive secularism describes a state approach that upholds neutrality toward religion by neither promoting nor suppressing it, thereby accommodating religious pluralism in the public sphere while maintaining institutional separation between state and religious authorities. This model emerged from ideological struggles where accommodationist views prevailed, allowing practices such as public religious displays, school vouchers for religious education, and congressional chaplains without state endorsement of any faith. In the United States, passive secularism has dominated since the founding era, as reflected in Supreme Court rulings like *Zorach v. Clauson* (1952), which permitted released time for religious instruction, and ongoing accommodations for Muslim headscarves in federal employment. Similar patterns appear in India, where the constitution's Articles 25-28 guarantee religious freedom and permit personal laws based on faith, fostering a passive framework amid diverse religious communities.\n\nAssertive secularism, conversely, entails active state intervention to exclude religion from public domains, confining it to private life to safeguard secular governance and prevent clerical influence. This approach arises from historical dominance of anti-clerical ideologies, often in contexts of strong religious establishments perceived as threats to national unity or modernization. France exemplifies assertive secularism through its 1905 Law on the Separation of Churches and State, which dissolved the Catholic Church's public role, and the 2004 ban on conspicuous religious symbols in public schools, enforced to uphold *laïcité* and applied to items like hijabs and Sikh turbans. In Turkey, assertive policies under Mustafa Kemal Atatürk in the 1920s-1930s abolished the caliphate in 1924, banned religious attire for officials via the 1925 Hat Law, and closed religious schools, aiming to marginalize Islam's public presence despite comprising 99% of the population. Mexico adopted a similar model post-1910 Revolution, with its 1917 Constitution's Article 130 stripping clergy of political rights and prohibiting religious education in schools until partial reforms in 1992.\n\nThe divergence between models stems from state-building eras' power dynamics: passive secularism thrives where religious groups allied with liberal factions against absolutist states, as in the U.S. during the 1780s constitutional debates, yielding compromises like the First Amendment's non-establishment clause without public exclusion. Assertive secularism, however, consolidates when secular elites overpower entrenched religious hierarchies, as in France's Third Republic (1870-1940) amid Catholic monarchy legacies, or Turkey's post-Ottoman reforms. Empirical outcomes vary; passive systems correlate with higher religious participation rates—U.S. church attendance averaged 36% in 2020 Gallup polls—while assertive ones show declining practice but persistent underground influence, evidenced by Turkey's 2023 mosque construction surge under post-2000 shifts. Critics of assertive models argue they infringe individual freedoms, as seen in European Court of Human Rights cases like *Leyla Şahin v. Turkey* (2005), upholding headscarf bans but noting proportionality tensions. Passive models, while pluralistic, risk state capture by dominant religions, though U.S. data indicate minority protections via equal application of neutrality. Both face ideological resistance, with assertive regimes encountering Islamist backlashes, as in Turkey's Justice and Development Party gains since 2002, and passive ones debates over faith-based initiatives.\n\n### Comparative National Frameworks\n\nSecularism in national frameworks varies significantly, often aligning with passive models that accommodate religion in public life or assertive models that actively exclude religious influence from state institutions. In the United States, passive secularism predominates, rooted in the First Amendment's Establishment Clause and Free Exercise Clause, which bar federal establishment of religion while protecting individual religious practice, allowing practices like school vouchers for religious schools and congressional chaplains as long as no coercion occurs. This approach, influenced by historical Protestant pluralism, permits religious symbols and discourse in public spaces provided they do not endorse one faith over others, as affirmed in Supreme Court rulings such as *Lemon v. Kurtzman* (1971), which established tests for neutrality.\n\nFrance exemplifies assertive secularism through *laïcité*, codified in the 1905 Law on the Separation of Churches and the State, which dissolved the Napoleonic Concordat and mandated strict neutrality in public institutions, prohibiting religious instruction in state schools and symbols like the hijab in public schools per the 2004 law. This framework, emerging from anti-clerical Third Republic efforts, prioritizes republican unity over religious expression, with the state subsidizing non-religious public services while fining violations of neutrality, such as in the 2010 burqa ban upheld by the European Court of Human Rights in 2014.\n\nTurkey's Kemalist secularism, initially assertive like France's, was enshrined in the 1928 constitutional removal of Islam as state religion and 1937 explicit declaration of secularism, enforcing reforms like banning the fez and Arabic script to modernize along Western lines. However, since the Justice and Development Party's rise in 2002, policies have shifted toward accommodation, including lifting the headscarf ban for public employees in 2013 and expanding imam-hatip schools, reflecting ideological tensions between secular elites and Islamist currents, though the constitution retains secular principles.\n\nIndia's constitutional secularism, declared in the Preamble via the 42nd Amendment in 1976, adopts a positive model enabling state intervention for religious equality, permitting community-specific personal laws for marriage and inheritance under Articles 25-26, unlike strict separation elsewhere. This accommodates Hinduism, Islam, and others through uniform civil code debates, with the Supreme Court striking down practices like triple talaq in 2017 to align with equality, balancing sarva dharma sambhava (equal respect for religions) amid critiques of pseudo-secularism favoring minorities.\n\n| Country       | Model Type     | Key Constitutional/Legal Basis                  | State Role Toward Religion                  |\n|---------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| United States | Passive       | First Amendment (1791)                          | Accommodates without endorsement            |\n| France        | Assertive     | 1905 Separation Law                             | Excludes from public sphere                 |\n| Turkey        | Assertive (evolving) | 1928/1937 Amendments                           | Historically restrictive, recent relaxations|\n| India         | Positive/Accommodative | Preamble (1976), Articles 25-26                | Intervenes for equality, retains personal laws |\n\nThese frameworks illustrate causal links between historical ideologies—Protestant tolerance in the US, Catholic-monarchy conflicts in France, Ottoman-Islamic reforms in Turkey, and colonial pluralism in India—and policy outcomes, with assertive models often correlating with centralized state-building but risking backlash from religious majorities. Empirical data from Pew Research shows higher religious regulation in assertive states like France (score 6.5/10 in 2020 Government Restrictions Index) versus the US (4.3), underscoring varied enforcement amid global migration pressures.\n\n## Institutional Applications\n\n### State-Church Separation\n\nThe principle of state-church separation mandates that governmental institutions maintain institutional independence from religious authorities, prohibiting the establishment of an official religion, state favoritism toward any faith, and excessive religious interference in public policy. This doctrine emerged prominently during the Enlightenment as a safeguard against theocratic governance and religious persecution, drawing from experiences in colonial America where dissenters like Roger Williams advocated disestablishment in Rhode Island as early as 1636 to foster religious pluralism. In practice, it ensures that public resources are not allocated to promote religious doctrines and that civil laws derive from rational, evidence-based deliberation rather than scriptural mandates.\n\nIn the United States, separation is constitutionally anchored in the First Amendment's Establishment Clause, ratified on December 15, 1791, which declares: \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion.\" This provision, informed by debates at the 1787 Constitutional Convention and state ratifying conventions, aimed to prevent federal entanglement with religion while permitting free exercise, as evidenced by the absence of religious tests for office under Article VI. President Thomas Jefferson reinforced the interpretation in his January 1, 1802, letter to the Danbury Baptist Association, describing a \"wall of separation between Church \\u0026 State\" to assure minority sects of protection from majority religious dominance. Subsequent Supreme Court rulings, such as Everson v. Board of Education (1947), extended this to states via the Fourteenth Amendment, prohibiting public funding for religious schools while allowing incidental benefits under strict scrutiny.\n\nFrance exemplifies assertive separation through laïcité, codified in the Law of December 9, 1905, on the Separation of the Churches and the State, which abrogated the 1801 Concordat with the Vatican, nationalized church property, and ended state salaries for clergy. The 1958 Constitution's Article 1 affirms republican secularism, banning religious symbols in public schools since 2004 to preserve state neutrality amid demographic shifts. In Turkey, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk's reforms included Article 2 of the 1928 Constitution amendment declaring the republic secular, abolishing the caliphate in 1924 and removing Islam as the state religion to modernize governance along Kemalist principles. India's 1950 Constitution, under Articles 14-18, enforces equality without a state religion, though accommodations for personal laws persist; the 1976 addition of \"secular\" to the Preamble underscored equidistance from all faiths despite Hindu-majority demographics.\n\nThese frameworks vary in strictness: the U.S. model permits religious expression in public forums if non-coercive, as in Lemon v. Kurtzman (1971)'s invalidated state aid to parochial schools for risking entanglement, while French laïcité rigorously excludes religious influence from state functions. Empirical surveys indicate broad public endorsement, with a 2021 Pew Research Center poll finding 67% of Americans favoring separation over integration, though support dips among white evangelicals at 45%. Cross-nationally, separation correlates with reduced state transfers to religious entities, as modeled in analyses showing decreased redistribution to faith-based services when disestablishment occurs, potentially shifting welfare burdens to secular mechanisms. Challenges persist, including debates over accommodations like tax exemptions for religious organizations, which some argue implicitly subsidize faith without direct establishment.\n\n### Legal and Governmental Structures\n\nLegal and governmental structures of secularism primarily manifest through constitutional provisions and statutes that mandate state neutrality toward religion, prohibit the establishment of an official faith, and safeguard individual religious freedoms without governmental endorsement or coercion. Approximately 41% of national constitutions worldwide explicitly establish secularism or separation of religion from state affairs, often alongside guarantees of equality irrespective of belief. These frameworks aim to prevent religious influence over public policy while permitting private practice, though interpretations vary between passive accommodation and assertive exclusion of religious symbols or authority in governance.\n\nIn the United States, the First Amendment's Establishment Clause, ratified on December 15, 1791, declares that \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,\" barring federal and, via incorporation, state governments from favoring or funding any religion. This clause, paired with the Free Exercise Clause, forms the bedrock of church-state separation, enforced by judicial tests such as the Lemon test (1971), which requires laws to have a secular purpose, neither advance nor inhibit religion, and avoid excessive entanglement. U.S. governmental structures reflect this through oaths of office without religious tests (Article VI) and prohibitions on religious qualifications for office, ensuring officials operate under civil authority alone.\n\nFrance exemplifies assertive secularism via the Law of December 9, 1905, on the Separation of Churches and the State, which ended state recognition and funding of religions, declaring the Republic neither recognizes nor salaries any cult. Enshrined in Article 1 of the 1958 Constitution, *laïcité* mandates strict neutrality in public institutions, prohibiting religious attire for civil servants and, since the 2004 law, conspicuous symbols like the hijab in public schools to preserve a secular educational space. Governmental bodies, including the Council of State, oversee compliance, fining violations and maintaining registers of associations cultuelles for worship without state interference.\n\nTurkey's framework, initiated by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, removed Islam as the state religion from the constitution on April 10, 1928, embedding *laiklik* (secularism) in Article 2 of the 1982 Constitution, which defines the state as \"democratic, secular, and social.\" This assertive model empowers the government to regulate religious expression, as seen in the Directorate of Religious Affairs controlling mosques and curricula, and bans on items like the fez or religious political parties deemed anti-secular, enforced by the Constitutional Court.\n\nIn India, secularism is articulated through Articles 25-28, guaranteeing freedom of religion subject to public order, morality, and health, with the state empowered to reform practices, as in the 1950s temple entry laws. The word \"secular\" was inserted into the Preamble via the 42nd Amendment on November 25, 1976, upheld by the Supreme Court in 2024 as consistent with the original intent of equal treatment for all religions without favoritism. This accommodative structure allows personal laws for religious communities but subordinates them to fundamental rights, with the government intervening in disputes via bodies like the National Commission for Minorities.\n\n## Societal Implications\n\n### Cultural and Educational Impacts\n\nSecularism in educational systems emphasizes curricula grounded in empirical evidence, scientific method, and critical reasoning, often excluding confessional religious instruction in public institutions. In France, the 1905 law on separation of church and state extended laïcité to schools, mandating neutral environments free from religious proselytism since 1882 under Jules Ferry laws, which established free, compulsory, and secular primary education. Similar policies in Turkey under Atatürk's reforms in the 1920s secularized education by replacing madrasas with state schools focused on modern sciences, contributing to a tripling of literacy rates from 10% in 1927 to 33% by 1950. These reforms prioritized rational inquiry, correlating with expanded access to higher education; by 2023, Turkey's tertiary enrollment reached 120 per 100 inhabitants aged 18-22.\n\nEmpirical analyses reveal a negative correlation between national religiosity and student performance in science and mathematics. A 2017 study across 64 countries using PISA 2012 data found that higher aggregate religiosity—measured by Gallup surveys—was associated with lower scores, with correlation coefficients ranging from -0.48 for science to -0.52 for mathematics, even after controlling for GDP per capita and governance quality. This pattern holds in cross-national comparisons: secular nations like those in Scandinavia averaged PISA science scores above 500 in 2018, versus below 400 in highly religious developing states. Such outcomes align with secular curricula reducing doctrinal conflicts, as evidenced by higher acceptance of evolution in secular education systems; in the U.S., states with stronger religious influences show lower scientific literacy, with biblical literalism predicting 15-20% deficits in evolution understanding per General Social Survey data.\n\nCulturally, secularism fosters pluralistic expressions in arts and literature by diminishing religious censorship and monopoly on narrative authority. Post-Enlightenment Europe saw a surge in secular-themed works; for instance, French literature from Voltaire onward prioritized humanistic ethics over divine providence, influencing global canons with over 70% of Nobel Literature laureates from 1901-2023 hailing from majority-secular nations. This shift enabled diverse traditions, such as the rise of non-religious festivals like Norway's Constitution Day, which evolved from Christian roots into civic celebrations attended by 80% of the population annually. However, critics note potential erosion of cohesive traditions; in the Netherlands, secularization since the 1960s pillarization breakdown correlated with a 50% drop in classical music concert attendance tied to church choirs, from 1960s peaks to under 20% participation by 2010s surveys.\n\nIn societal terms, secular educational mandates have accelerated cultural secularization, with longitudinal data from compulsory schooling reforms showing reduced religiosity; a Norwegian study post-1960s reforms found each additional schooling year decreasing religious belief by 1.5-4%, fostering environments where empirical skepticism informs cultural production over faith-based motifs. Yet, this has prompted hybrid forms, such as secular rituals in performing arts—e.g., community theater substituting for religious pageants in Italy's post-Vatican II era, sustaining social bonds amid declining Mass attendance from 40% in 1981 to 23% in 2021. Overall, while enabling innovation, secularism's cultural impacts include fragmented heritage transmission, as evidenced by UNESCO reports on intangible traditions where religious-secular divides halved preservation efforts in Europe from 2003-2020.\n\n### Effects on Family, Morality, and Social Cohesion\n\nSecularization has been associated with declining fertility rates across societies, with empirical analyses of 181 countries showing a negative correlation between societal secularism—measured by indices of religious adherence and institutional influence—and total fertility rates, even after controlling for economic development and education levels. This pattern holds in Western contexts where declining church membership contributes to delayed family formation and lower birth rates below replacement levels, as observed in Europe since the 1960s. Regular religious service attendance, conversely, correlates with marital stability, reducing divorce risk by up to 50% in longitudinal U.S. studies tracking couples over 14 years. In secular environments, premarital cohabitation and civil unions precede higher divorce rates, partly due to reduced selectivity in partner commitment compared to religious marriages.\n\nOn morality, secularization prompts a transition from religiously grounded absolutes to relativistic or humanistic frameworks, though direct causal evidence linking it to broad moral decline remains inconclusive. Cross-national data indicate that while religious individuals report higher adherence to traditional pro-social norms like honesty and altruism, secular populations exhibit comparable or higher compliance in secular ethical domains such as environmental stewardship, suggesting morality persists but evolves independently of religious decline in some metrics. Critics, including conservative analysts, attribute rises in behaviors like non-marital births and euthanasia acceptance to secular moral erosion, yet empirical reviews find no unambiguous spike in antisocial acts attributable to secularism alone, with factors like urbanization confounding outcomes. Peer-reviewed syntheses emphasize that religiosity reinforces certain moral intuitions via communal reinforcement, but secular ethics derive from evolved cognitive biases toward fairness, mitigating total collapse.\n\nRegarding social cohesion, higher religiosity predicts stronger community ties and generalized trust, with frequent religious attendance linked to increased volunteering and perceived cooperativeness in European surveys spanning multiple nations. Secularization correlates with eroded associational life, as religious organizations historically provided networks for civic engagement; their decline in the U.S. and Europe since the mid-20th century parallels reduced participation in non-familial groups. Country-level data further reveal that state support for religion bolsters interpersonal trust, with secular policies showing inverse associations in comparative analyses of over 100 nations. However, secular rituals can foster bonding akin to religious ones, potentially offsetting some losses in affect and affiliation, though longitudinal evidence points to net weakening of kin-based and communal solidarity in highly secularized settings like Scandinavia.\n\n## Philosophical Underpinnings\n\n### Key Thinkers and Rationalist Traditions\n\nJohn Locke (1632–1704) advanced secular principles by distinguishing civil authority from religious practice, arguing that government coercion in matters of faith undermines both societal peace and authentic belief. In his *A Letter Concerning Toleration* (1689), Locke maintained that the magistrate's role is confined to protecting civil interests, such as life, liberty, and property, while churches function as voluntary associations whose salvation cannot be enforced by state power. This separation aimed to avert the religious wars plaguing Europe, positing toleration as essential for stable governance rather than a concession to pluralism.\n\nVoltaire (1694–1778) critiqued institutional religion's role in intolerance and persecution, advocating rational inquiry and mutual forbearance as bulwarks against fanaticism. His *Treatise on Tolerance* (1763), prompted by the wrongful execution of Protestant merchant Jean Calas in 1762, urged societies to prioritize reason and evidence over doctrinal conformity, insisting that harmless differences in worship should not provoke civil discord. Voltaire's deism rejected organized dogma's political influence while defending a minimal theistic framework, influencing later secular reforms by highlighting religion's potential to exacerbate rather than resolve conflicts.\n\nBaruch Spinoza (1632–1677) pioneered secular hermeneutics and political liberty from theological oversight in *Tractatus Theologico-Politicus* (1670), applying historical and contextual analysis to scripture to demonstrate its accommodation to human understanding rather than divine dictation. Spinoza contended that true piety consists in justice and charity, not ritual or orthodoxy, and that freedom of thought—unfettered by ecclesiastical censorship—is indispensable for both intellectual progress and republican stability. His pantheistic naturalism equated God with nature's laws, diminishing supernatural claims' authority over philosophy and statecraft.\n\nDavid Hume (1711–1776) eroded religious epistemology through rigorous skepticism, challenging miracles as violations of uniform experience and teleological arguments as anthropomorphic projections. In *Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion* (1779), Hume's interlocutors dissect the inadequacies of inferring design from order, favoring empirical naturalism that attributes cosmic regularity to necessity rather than intent. His critique extended to religion's moral utility, viewing it as a source of division prone to enthusiasm, thus bolstering secular alternatives grounded in observable human sentiments and utility.\n\nRationalist traditions in secular thought emphasize reason's autonomy from revelation, tracing to early modern efforts to systematize knowledge via innate ideas or methodical doubt. René Descartes (1596–1650) initiated this by doubting all but self-evident truths in *Meditations on First Philosophy* (1641), establishing certainty through rational deduction independent of scriptural validation. Complementing this, Francis Bacon (1561–1626) promoted inductive empiricism in *Novum Organum* (1620), critiquing idolized authorities—including religious dogma—that obstruct factual inquiry, thereby enabling a secular science focused on nature's mechanisms over providential explanations. Bacon's framework secularized natural philosophy by subordinating theology to empirical verification, influencing the Enlightenment's displacement of faith-based cosmologies with mechanistic causality. These traditions collectively prioritized verifiable propositions, fostering governance and ethics derived from human reason rather than divine mandate.\n\n### Secular Humanism and Ethical Systems\n\nSecular humanism emerged as a distinct ethical and philosophical framework in the early 20th century, emphasizing human reason, scientific inquiry, and empirical evidence as the foundations for morality and meaning, without reliance on supernatural or religious authority. It views humans as products of natural evolution, capable of deriving ethical norms from observable human needs, social cooperation, and the consequences of actions on well-being. This approach contrasts with theistic systems by grounding values in naturalistic principles rather than divine commands, asserting that moral progress arises from rational deliberation and experiential testing.\n\nThe movement gained formal expression through a series of manifestos issued by humanist organizations. The first, *A Humanist Manifesto* (1933), signed by 34 intellectuals including philosophers John Dewey and Raymond Bragg, outlined affirmations on cosmology, human nature, and ethics, promoting a religious humanism that rejected dogma while initially accommodating broader spiritual interpretations. By *Humanist Manifesto II* (1973), drafted amid challenges like totalitarianism and technological risks, the focus shifted to explicit secularism, advocating free inquiry, evolutionary ethics, and democratic secularism as bulwarks against authoritarianism. *Humanism and Its Aspirations* (2003), known as Manifesto III, reaffirmed these by declaring humanism a progressive philosophy that affirms ethical lives of personal fulfillment aspiring to the greater good of humanity, tested through experience and reason.\n\nCentral to secular humanist ethics is a consequentialist framework, where moral actions are evaluated by their outcomes in promoting human welfare, dignity, and reduced suffering, informed by scientific understanding of human behavior and society. Proponents argue this system derives from innate human capacities for empathy, reciprocity, and rational self-interest, evolved through natural selection and refined by cultural progress, enabling objective assessments via evidence rather than revelation. For instance, ethical principles prioritize informed individual choices, mutual care in social relations, and equitable resource distribution to foster justice and peace, with humans bearing sole responsibility for implementing and advancing these ideals. Organizations like the American Humanist Association, founded in 1941, and the Council for Secular Humanism promote these through education and advocacy, viewing morality as a human construct adaptable to empirical realities rather than fixed absolutes.\n\nCritics from religious perspectives contend that without a transcendent source, secular humanist ethics risks relativism or subjective preference, lacking an ultimate justification for universal obligations, as human-derived standards may shift with cultural or scientific changes. However, humanist thinkers counter that theistic ethics similarly rely on unverifiable premises, while consequentialism provides a pragmatic, testable basis aligned with causal realities of human interdependence and evolutionary biology. Empirical support for this system points to secular societies exhibiting high levels of social trust and low violence, though causation remains debated; the framework's strength lies in its falsifiability and adaptability, rejecting unprovable dogmas in favor of evidence-based refinement.\n\n## Criticisms and Debates\n\n### Religious and Traditionalist Objections\n\nReligious adherents, particularly from Abrahamic traditions, object to secularism on the grounds that it privatizes faith and excludes divine revelation from public governance and law, thereby severing society's moral order from its transcendent source. The Catholic Church defines secularism as a doctrine confining human conduct to considerations derived exclusively from earthly life, rejecting the supernatural dimension of existence and the soul's orientation toward eternity. This exclusion, critics argue, fosters materialism and moral autonomy untethered from God's law, as articulated in papal exhortations urging confrontation with secularism through renewed faith in Christ to counter its cultural dominance. Similarly, Islamic scholars maintain that secularism contradicts the holistic nature of Sharia, which integrates worship, ethics, and politics under divine sovereignty; separating these spheres is viewed as an artificial Western imposition that fragments human life and invites moral decay.\n\nTraditionalist philosophers extend these critiques by contending that secularism dissolves the communal virtues sustained by religious and customary narratives, replacing them with emotivist preferences masquerading as rationality. Alasdair MacIntyre, in his analysis of modernity's moral failures, posits that the Enlightenment's rejection of teleological traditions—rooted in Aristotelian-Thomistic ethics—inherited from Christianity left secular ethics incoherent, reducing moral claims to subjective expressions without shared goods or narrative unity. Roger Scruton echoed this by observing that secular institutions, stripped of sacred elements, become profane shells devoid of reverence, eroding the aesthetic and communal bonds that religion historically provided against nihilism and cultural uprooting. Such objections hold that without religion's anchoring role, societies devolve into atomized individualism, where traditions weaken and authority yields to transient ideologies, as evidenced in critiques of secularism's association with the loss of transcendence and its implicit oppression of inherited worldviews.\n\n### Empirical Evidence on Outcomes\n\nSocietal secularism exhibits a robust negative association with fertility rates across 181 countries, where higher secularism levels predict both lower national total fertility rates and reduced fertility intentions among individuals, particularly religious persons embedded in secular contexts. This pattern persists after controlling for economic development and education, suggesting secular values emphasizing individualism and career prioritization contribute to delayed childbearing and smaller family sizes. Consequently, highly secular nations like those in Western Europe face accelerating population aging and dependency ratios, with projections indicating fertility below replacement levels (1.3-1.6 births per woman) sustaining long-term demographic contraction.\n\nSecularism correlates with diminished family structures and elevated loneliness, mediated by reduced marriage rates, higher divorce prevalence, and increased kinlessness. Multilevel longitudinal analyses of European data reveal that residence in more secular countries amplifies loneliness among older adults through fewer intergenerational ties and solitary living arrangements. Empirical reviews further link religiosity to stronger prosocial behaviors and social cohesion, with meta-analyses showing religious involvement fosters constructive actions (e.g., volunteering, trust) while curbing destructive ones, implying secular individualism may erode communal bonds. \n\nOn criminality, meta-analytic evidence indicates religiosity exerts a moderate deterrent effect, reducing individual offending rates by 10-20% through enhanced self-control and normative adherence; aggregate studies confirm higher religious congregation density associates with lower crime in disadvantaged areas.  Systematic reviews of post-2000 research affirm an inverse religion-crime link, though effects weaken in highly secular contexts where alternative institutions (e.g., welfare states) may substitute.\n\nEconomic outcomes present mixed correlations: while cross-country data link religious beliefs (e.g., in afterlife accountability) to positive growth via work ethic and risk aversion, secularization often precedes prosperity, with studies showing declining religiosity predicts future GDP increases when paired with tolerance for diverse beliefs.  Religious participation boosts individual labor outcomes like earnings and employment, particularly for vulnerable groups, but aggregate secular shifts correlate with higher productivity through reduced time diverted to rituals, albeit potentially at the cost of elevated risky behaviors.\n\nWell-being metrics favor secular societies in aggregate rankings, with Nordic countries—among the most secular—topping 2023 World Happiness Reports due to robust social safety nets and equality, despite low religiosity. Individual-level analyses, however, reveal actively religious persons report higher life satisfaction globally (e.g., 36% vs. 25% \"very happy\" in U.S. Pew data), a gap narrowing in wealthy secular nations where non-religious individuals match religious happiness via secular supports. In stressed or poorer religious-majority countries, religiosity amplifies happiness more distinctly. These patterns suggest secularism sustains high societal well-being through institutional mechanisms but may not replicate religion's direct buffering against personal distress.\n\n### Controversies Over Neutrality and Bias\n\nCritics of secularism argue that its professed neutrality toward religion is illusory, as it presupposes a worldview that privileges empirical-rationalist epistemologies over faith-based ones, effectively marginalizing religious perspectives in public discourse. This critique posits that excluding religious arguments from policy-making—via standards like \"public reason\"—imposes a secular bias, restricting religious citizens' full participation without advancing a truly impartial framework. Academic analyses, often from within secular-leaning institutions, acknowledge this tension but frequently frame it as necessary for pluralism, while conservative and religious scholars contend it entrenches materialism as the default ontology.\n\nIn governmental practice, France's 2004 law prohibiting \"conspicuous\" religious symbols—such as the Islamic hijab, Jewish kippah, or large Christian crosses—in public schools exemplifies controversies over enforced neutrality, with implementation disproportionately impacting Muslim students and sparking accusations of cultural assimilation under laïcité. Enacted on March 15, 2004, following debates on integration, the policy was upheld by the European Court of Human Rights in 2014 but criticized by human rights groups for infringing religious freedom without equivalent scrutiny of secular symbols, revealing a selective application that favors state-defined secularity. Subsequent expansions, like 2010's burqa ban in public spaces, have intensified claims of bias against visible religious minorities, with 2023 proposals to extend restrictions to sports events underscoring ongoing tensions.\n\nPublic education systems in secular states further highlight alleged biases, as curricula emphasize naturalistic explanations—like evolutionary biology—while often barring religious alternatives, such as intelligent design, under neutrality pretexts that critics view as establishing secular humanism as de facto ideology. In the U.S., Supreme Court rulings since Engel v. Vitale (1962) have prohibited school-sponsored prayer, yet permitted teachings aligned with secular ethics, prompting arguments that this asymmetry promotes irreligion over equal accommodation. Similarly, the 2005 Terri Schiavo case, involving the withdrawal of life-sustaining feeding after 15 years in a persistent vegetative state, demonstrated how bioethical standards rooted in utilitarian secularism overrode family religious objections, with courts prioritizing autonomy-based judgments despite conflicting medical testimonies.\n\nEmpirical studies reinforce perceptions of inherent bias, with a 2025 experiment finding that individuals endorsing a \"new\" secularism—framed as progressive and inclusive—exhibited higher prejudice toward religious groups compared to those viewing it traditionally, suggesting secular identities can foster exclusionary attitudes akin to those attributed to religion. Such findings challenge mainstream academic narratives, which, influenced by prevailing secular orientations, may underemphasize these dynamics in favor of portraying secularism as inherently tolerant. Proponents counter that true neutrality requires curbing religious influence to prevent privilege, yet detractors maintain this substitutes one dominance for another, undermining secularism's foundational claims.\n\n## Contemporary Trends\n\n### Global Secularization Patterns\n\nFrom 2010 to 2020, the global number of religiously unaffiliated individuals increased by 270 million, reaching 1.9 billion, representing a 17% rise, while the share of the world's population affiliated with a religion declined slightly from 76.7% to 75.8%. This shift occurred amid a drop of at least 5 percentage points in the religious affiliation share in 35 countries. Secularization patterns exhibit a predictable sequence across societies: initial declines in public religious rituals and participation, followed by reduced personal importance of religion, and finally decreases in formal affiliation, with progression varying by region.\n\nIn Europe, secularization is most advanced, with low religious centrality and widespread disaffiliation; for instance, fewer countries maintain Christian majorities compared to prior decades, reflecting long-term trends of declining church attendance and belief. East Asia similarly shows low religiosity, driven by urbanization and education, though patterns differ from Europe's Christian context. In contrast, sub-Saharan Africa remains at an early stage, with high religious participation and 30.7% of global Christians residing there as of 2020, up from Europe's 22.3% share, bolstered by higher fertility rates among religious populations.\n\nThe Americas and Asia occupy intermediate stages, with moderate religious centrality and ongoing declines in ritual observance and affiliation importance, particularly among younger cohorts. In Latin America and parts of Asia, religious switching is pronounced, with Christianity and Buddhism experiencing net losses. North America mirrors this, as the U.S. unaffiliated share reached 28-29% by 2023-2025, though growth has slowed since 2020. Globally, while unaffiliated numbers grow, demographic factors like higher birth rates in religious regions in Africa and the Middle East sustain overall religious majorities, countering uniform secularization.\n\n### Recent Backlashes and Reversals\n\nIn Poland, the Law and Justice (PiS) government, in power from 2015 to 2023, advanced policies integrating Catholic teachings into state law, culminating in a October 22, 2020, Constitutional Tribunal ruling that restricted legal abortions to cases of rape, incest, or immediate threat to the mother's life, effectively overturning prior provisions allowing terminations for fetal anomalies—a move critics described as prioritizing religious doctrine over secular reproductive rights. This decision, supported by the Catholic Church hierarchy, sparked massive protests but reflected a broader PiS effort to embed religious values in governance, including alliances with evangelical groups and resistance to EU secular mandates on issues like judicial independence. PiS's defeat in the October 2023 elections marked a partial reversal, yet the ruling entrenched religious influence in Polish institutions, with church attendance remaining high at around 36% weekly in 2021 surveys compared to EU averages.\n\nHungary under Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has pursued \"Christian democracy\" since amending its constitution in 2011, with 2020s policies reinforcing family structures based on traditional religious norms, such as the 2020 ban on legal recognition of same-sex partnerships and subsidies favoring married heterosexual couples with children—framed as defending national identity against \"liberal secularism\" and demographic decline. Orbán's Fidesz party, drawing on alliances with the Catholic and Reformed churches, has positioned Hungary as a bulwark for Europe's Christian heritage, enacting a 2021 law restricting content on homosexuality in schools, which the European Court of Justice criticized in 2023 but which Orbán defended as protecting minors per biblical principles. These measures correlate with sustained religiosity, where 52% of Hungarians identified as religious in 2021, higher than in more secular neighbors like the Czech Republic.\n\nIn India, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) under Prime Minister Narendra Modi has accelerated Hindutva policies since 2014, with key 2020s developments including the January 22, 2024, inauguration of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya on the site of the demolished Babri Masjid, symbolizing a shift from Nehruvian secularism toward Hindu-majority cultural assertion and prompting concerns over minority rights. The 2019 Citizenship Amendment Act, implemented via rules finalized in March 2024, fast-tracks citizenship for non-Muslim refugees from neighboring countries, excluding Muslims and challenging constitutional secular equality—a policy upheld amid protests as correcting historical partitions favoring Islamic states. BJP governance has seen temple constructions and cow protection laws proliferate in states, with 2024 surveys indicating 65% public support for Hindutva as cultural nationalism rather than religious imposition.\n\nTurkey under President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and the Justice and Development Party (AKP) has eroded Kemalist secularism through incremental reforms, including the 2020 conversion of Hagia Sophia from museum to mosque and tightened alcohol regulations in 2022, reversing Atatürk-era restrictions on religious expression while maintaining constitutional secularism in name. These actions, coupled with curriculum changes emphasizing Ottoman-Islamic history, have boosted mosque attendance and religious education enrollment, with 2023 data showing 90% of Turks identifying as Muslim and growing support for political Islam. Erdoğan's 2023 reelection, despite economic challenges, underscores voter preference for faith-infused governance over strict laïcité.\n\nThese cases illustrate de-secularization driven by populist appeals to religious majorities amid globalization and migration pressures, with empirical studies noting correlations between economic insecurity and religious revivalism, though outcomes vary by institutional resilience—Poland and Hungary facing EU pushback, while India and Turkey consolidate domestic power. Critics from secular perspectives argue such reversals undermine pluralism, yet proponents cite stabilizing social cohesion in polls showing majority approval in affected polities.",
