  "content": "# Jacob Elordi\n\nJacob Elordi (born June 26, 1997) is an Australian actor who rose to prominence with his breakout role as Noah Flynn in the Netflix teen romantic comedy *The Kissing Booth* (2018) and its sequels. He further established himself as a leading man through his portrayal of the troubled high school athlete Nate Jacobs in the HBO drama series *Euphoria* (2019–present).\n\nBorn in Brisbane, Queensland, Elordi grew up in a working-class household; his father, John, was a house painter who built their family home over 13 years, while his mother, Melissa, worked in the cafeteria at his school. He showed an early interest in acting, landing his first role as the Cat in the Hat in a school production of *Seussical*, and honed an American accent starting at age 14 while immersing himself in films by actors like Marlon Brando and Heath Ledger. Elordi did not complete university and barely finished high school, opting instead for self-education through books and theater. In 2017, after filming *The Kissing Booth* in South Africa, he relocated to Los Angeles to pursue acting professionally, initially couch-surfing and sleeping in his car amid financial struggles before securing a role on *Euphoria* that provided stability.\n\nElordi's feature film debut came in the Australian comedy *Swinging Safari* (2018), also known internationally as *Flammable Children*, where he played the character Rooster. Following the global success of *The Kissing Booth* trilogy (2018–2021), he expanded into diverse genres, starring as Chris Gregory in the romantic drama *2 Hearts* (2020), the paramour Charlie in the erotic thriller *Deep Water* (2022), and the serial killer Bobby in *He Went That Way* (2024). In 2023, he delivered critically noted performances as the aristocratic Oxford student Felix Catton in Emerald Fennell's *Saltburn* and as Elvis Presley in Sofia Coppola's *Priscilla*. That year, he also appeared in *The Sweet East*, and served as an executive producer on *He Went That Way*.\n\nIn recent years, Elordi has taken on more prominent leading roles, including the young Julius in the drama *On Swift Horses* (2024), the younger Leonard Fife in *Oh, Canada* (2024), and Dorrigo Evans, a haunted prisoner of war, in the Amazon Prime Video miniseries adaptation of Richard Flanagan's *The Narrow Road to the Deep North* (2025). He underwent a transformative 10-hour daily makeup process to portray Frankenstein's Creature in Guillermo del Toro's 2025 Netflix adaptation of *Frankenstein*, opposite Oscar Isaac as Victor Frankenstein. Looking ahead, Elordi is slated to reprise Nate Jacobs in the third season of *Euphoria* and to play the brooding Heathcliff opposite Margot Robbie's Cathy in Emerald Fennell's erotic reimagining of *Wuthering Heights*, set for release in 2026, as well as leading Hig in Ridley Scott's *The Dog Stars* (TBA) and starring opposite Lily-Rose Depp in László Nemes' *Outer Dark* (TBA).\n\n## Early life and education\n\n### Family background and childhood\n\nJacob Elordi was born Jacob Nathaniel Elordi on June 26, 1997, in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, to parents John and Melissa Elordi. His father, John, immigrated to Australia at age eight from the Basque Country, a region spanning northern Spain and southwestern France, and worked as a housepainter and handyman, even building the family's home over 13 years. Melissa, an Australian native and primarily a stay-at-home mother who volunteered in the cafeteria at his school, fostering a close-knit environment in their working-class household.\n\nElordi's paternal heritage traces to the Basque region through his father's family, with his grandfather originating from Ondarroa; he has publicly emphasized this distinction, correcting references to broader Spanish descent. His mother's Australian roots contributed to a culturally blended upbringing, though details on her specific ancestry remain limited. As the youngest of four children, Elordi grew up \"spoiled\" alongside three older sisters, including Isabella, a former ballet dancer and photographer, and Jalynn, a model. The family briefly relocated from Brisbane to Melbourne to support Isabella's studies at the Australian Ballet School.\n\nDuring his early years in Brisbane, Elordi developed a passion for theater and storytelling, immersing himself in films, books on cinema, and online audition videos of actors. By age 12, he began performing in school musicals, taking on roles such as Oberon in *A Midsummer Night's Dream*, which helped him navigate childhood bullying and build confidence. This formative period in a supportive, modest family setting laid the groundwork for his later creative pursuits, though his interests remained rooted in performance rather than sports or other activities.\n\n### Schooling and initial interests in acting\n\nElordi attended St Joseph's College, Nudgee, a private all-boys Roman Catholic secondary school in Brisbane, Australia, where he completed his education and graduated in 2015. During his high school years, he actively participated in drama classes and school productions, which allowed him to explore his growing passion for performing arts. These experiences were pivotal in nurturing his interest in acting, as he took on roles such as The Cat in the Hat in the school's production of *Seussical* and Oberon in *A Midsummer Night's Dream*, where he embraced a flamboyant, gender-transgressive portrayal complete with a leather jacket, rings, purple glitter, and spiked pink hair.\n\nHis serious pursuit of acting began around age 12, when he became fixated on the craft, inspired by classic performers like Marlon Brando and Laurence Olivier. Although he was involved in the school's rugby team, reflecting the sports-oriented culture of the institution, Elordi gradually shifted his focus toward theater amid peer teasing for his artistic interests, including being called \"gay\" after his first play. This decision to prioritize acting over sports was reinforced by a back injury that freed up time for rehearsals and performances, ultimately leading him to step away from the \"beer culture\" of team sports in favor of the stage. His family supported this career shift, recognizing his determination despite the unconventional path in a rugby-focused environment.\n\nLargely self-taught, Elordi honed his skills by reading hundreds of plays, biographies of renowned actors, and studying films to emulate their techniques, without formal training beyond high school drama. Following graduation, he took a gap year in 2015–2016, during which he worked odd jobs to support himself while auditioning for local theater productions in Australia, viewing Hollywood as his unwavering \"plan A\" with no backup career in mind. This period solidified his resolve, as he persisted through rejections, including submitting self-tapes from home, before landing his first professional opportunities.\n\n## Career\n\n### Early roles and breakthrough (2015–2019)\n\nAfter graduating from high school, where he had participated in school plays and developed an interest in acting, Jacob Elordi relocated from Australia to Los Angeles in 2017 to pursue a professional acting career full-time. At age 20, he initially faced significant challenges, couch-surfing at friends' homes, sleeping in his car, and taking odd jobs to support himself while attending auditions.\n\nElordi's screen debut came in 2015 with the short film *Carpe Liam*, a small independent project filmed in Australia. In 2017, he secured an uncredited extra role as a redcoat soldier in the Disney film *Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales*, marking his first Hollywood set experience during filming in Australia and the Gold Coast.\n\nElordi's breakthrough arrived in 2018 with the lead role of Noah Flynn, the brooding high school senior and love interest, in Netflix's teen romantic comedy *The Kissing Booth*. The film, directed by Vince Marcello and adapted from Beth Reekles' novel, was primarily shot in Cape Town, South Africa, where Elordi relocated temporarily for production. His casting came after persistent auditions amid his early struggles in Los Angeles, and the movie's release propelled him to international recognition, particularly among a global teen audience, amassing over 77 million views in its first month on Netflix.\n\nBuilding on this success, Elordi reprised the role of Noah Flynn in *The Kissing Booth 2*, filmed in South Africa in mid-2019 and released the following year. Later that year, he was cast as Nate Jacobs, the intense and troubled high school athlete, in HBO's drama series *Euphoria*, created by Sam Levinson. This role represented a pivotal shift toward more complex, dramatic characters, contrasting the lighthearted romance of his Netflix breakout.\n\n### Rising prominence (2020–2022)\n\nElordi's portrayal of the abusive and psychologically complex high school athlete Nate Jacobs in the first season of HBO's *Euphoria*, which premiered in 2019 but gained widespread attention throughout 2020 amid the COVID-19 lockdowns, earned him critical acclaim for capturing the character's toxic masculinity and emotional volatility. Critics praised his ability to embody a \"hot monster\" of a role, blending vulnerability with menace in a series that explored teen trauma and addiction. This performance marked a pivotal shift from his earlier lighthearted roles, solidifying his reputation as a versatile leading man capable of dramatic depth, and contributed to the show's ensemble receiving a Critics' Choice Television Award nomination for Best Drama Series in 2020.\n\nParallel to *Euphoria*'s rising buzz, Elordi reprised his role as the brooding heartthrob Noah Flynn in the Netflix sequels *The Kissing Booth 2* (2020) and *The Kissing Booth 3* (2021), which further entrenched his status as a romantic comedy star despite the films' poor critical reception. *The Kissing Booth 2* holds a 27% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes from critics, who lambasted its formulaic plot and underdeveloped characters, while *The Kissing Booth 3* fared even worse at 12%, criticized for repetitive tropes and lack of narrative progression. Nonetheless, the sequels amassed massive viewership—*The Kissing Booth 2* became Netflix's most-watched film in 27 countries upon release—leveraging Elordi's chemistry with co-star Joey King to maintain his appeal in mainstream teen entertainment. He starred as Chris Gregory in the romantic drama *2 Hearts* (2020), based on a true story of intertwined love and organ donation.\n\nDuring this period, Elordi expanded into additional film projects, including the Australian comedy *Swinging Safari* (2018), which received a limited U.S. release in 2019 but saw increased streaming visibility in 2020, where he played the rebellious lifeguard Rooster, a troubled teen navigating family dysfunction and small-town absurdity in 1970s Australia. He also appeared in a minor supporting role as Charlie De Lisle, the flirtatious young neighbor entangled in a web of jealousy and suspicion, in the erotic thriller *Deep Water* (2022), directed by Adrian Lyne and starring Ben Affleck and Ana de Armas, which premiered on Hulu and explored themes of possessive relationships.\n\nThe second season of *Euphoria*, filmed amid significant delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic that halted production from early 2020 until October of that year, finally premiered in January 2022 and amplified Elordi's visibility with deeper explorations of Nate's psyche, including his abusive family dynamics and internal conflicts. These disruptions, including multiple shutdowns due to positive cases on set, extended the wait for fans but allowed the season to resonate with post-pandemic themes of isolation and mental strain. In interviews, Elordi discussed the show's unflinching depiction of mental health issues, emphasizing how portraying Nate's volatility required him to confront the character's emotional toll while distinguishing it from his own well-being, noting the value in \"working hard\" on such intense material. The season's release not only boosted the series to new ratings highs but also positioned Elordi as a key figure in conversations about toxic masculinity and psychological realism in youth-oriented television.\n\n### Established success and diversification (2023–present)\n\nIn 2023, Elordi solidified his status as a leading actor with his portrayal of the aristocratic Oxford student Felix Catton in Emerald Fennell's *Saltburn*, a black comedy thriller that showcased his ability to blend charm and menace, earning him a BAFTA Film Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. That same year, he embodied Elvis Presley in Sofia Coppola's intimate biopic *Priscilla*, depicting the rock icon's complex relationship with Priscilla Presley from her teenage years through their marriage, a role that required Elordi to gain weight and adopt the singer's mannerisms for authenticity. He also took on a supporting indie role as Ian, an arrogant British actor, in Sean Price Williams' satirical road-trip film *The Sweet East*, which premiered in the Directors' Fortnight section at the Cannes Film Festival, highlighting his versatility in smaller ensemble projects.\n\nElordi's momentum continued into 2024 with the release of *He Went That Way*, a crime thriller directed by Jeffrey Darling, where he played Bobby Falls, a charismatic yet dangerous 19-year-old serial killer based on a real 1960s case, opposite Zachary Quinto as an animal trainer who unwittingly picks him up on a road trip, and served as an executive producer. The film, adapted from Conrad Hilberry's nonfiction book *Luke Karamazov*, marked Elordi's delve into true-crime territory and further demonstrated his range in tense, character-driven narratives. In *Oh, Canada* (2025), he portrayed the young Leonard Fife in Paul Schrader's drama about a documentary filmmaker evading the Vietnam draft.\n\nBy 2025, Elordi had transitioned into major lead roles across prestige television and high-profile cinema. He starred as the young Julius, a Korean War veteran, in the drama *On Swift Horses* (2025), adapted from Shannon Pufahl's novel exploring queer romance and post-war life. He starred as Lieutenant Colonel Dorrigo Evans in the five-part Amazon Prime Video miniseries *The Narrow Road to the Deep North*, an adaptation of Richard Flanagan's 2013 Man Booker Prize-winning novel that chronicles a surgeon's harrowing experiences as a WWII prisoner of war on the Burma Railway, interweaving themes of survival, love, and trauma across multiple timelines. Directed by Justin Kurzel, the series premiered to acclaim for its unflinching portrayal of historical brutality and Elordi's nuanced performance as a reluctant hero burdened by guilt. Later that year, Elordi portrayed the Creature in Guillermo del Toro's long-awaited Netflix adaptation of Mary Shelley's *Frankenstein*, undergoing a rigorous 11-hour daily prosthetics and makeup process to embody the tragic monster, while evolving a guttural, anguished voice through collaboration with del Toro and vocal coaches. The film, which debuted at the Venice Film Festival before its November 7 global streaming release, has garnered strong critical buzz for its gothic horror elements and Elordi's empathetic, physically demanding interpretation of the iconic role.\n\nThroughout 2025, in interviews promoting these projects, Elordi reflected on his career trajectory, emphasizing that the substantive roles he now undertakes—spanning historical dramas, literary adaptations, and genre explorations—align with the ambitious work he envisioned starting out, allowing him to avoid repetitive characterizations and embrace artistic depth. He also voiced a strong appreciation for Australian cinema, crediting its raw storytelling and cultural resonance as an influence on his own path, while expressing interest in returning to theater to reconnect with live performance's immediacy after years in film and television. Additionally, Elordi advocated for greater support of Australian productions, highlighting their unique perspectives in global storytelling during promotions for *The Narrow Road to the Deep North*.\n\n## Public image\n\n### Media perception and style\n\nJacob Elordi's public image has evolved significantly from his early portrayal as a teen heartthrob in the *Kissing Booth* trilogy (2018–2021), where he embodied the quintessential romantic lead, to a more introspective and brooding figure in films like *Saltburn* (2023) and *Priscilla* (2023), showcasing his range in darker, auteur-driven narratives. This shift has led media outlets to draw parallels between Elordi and actors like Timothée Chalamet for his sensitive, Gen Z appeal, and a young Leonardo DiCaprio for his transition from youthful charm to complex antiheroes. His recent role as the Creature in Guillermo del Toro's *Frankenstein* (2025) further cements this maturation, highlighting his willingness to embrace physically demanding and emotionally raw characters.\n\nElordi's fashion influence has positioned him as a modern style icon, blending high-end luxury with casual, vintage-inspired elements on red carpets and in campaigns. He has been featured in Calvin Klein advertisements since 2019, including the Spring 2021 campaign directed by Terence Nance, where his introspective persona complemented the brand's minimalist aesthetic. More recently, he starred in Bottega Veneta's \"What Are Dreams\" campaign (Fall 2025), photographed by Duane Michals, which explored surreal themes through his poised, enigmatic presence. His red carpet looks often mix streetwear with designer pieces, such as carrying a custom Louis Vuitton Monogram Speedy bag at the 2023 Venice Film Festival, signaling his affinity for Pharrell Williams' vision at the house. Media coverage praises his effortless approach, noting how it redefines male Hollywood style without overt ostentation.\n\nCoverage of Elordi's physical transformations for roles has spotlighted the pressures of body image in Hollywood, where he has openly discussed the objectification of male actors. For *Frankenstein*, his portrayal required over 40 prosthetics applied in a 10-hour process, altering his appearance dramatically to embody the Creature, though he entered production following a challenging weight loss from a prior project that he described as a \"blessing\" for emotional depth. In interviews, Elordi has critiqued the industry's focus on physiques, recalling his frustration during *The Kissing Booth* when emphasis on his sculpted body overshadowed his performance, and highlighting how such scrutiny contributes to body dysmorphia among men. He advocates for broader conversations on male objectification, emphasizing vitality over aesthetics.\n\nElordi's authenticity has garnered positive media attention, particularly his \"roguish Aussie charm\" that grounds his rising stardom in approachable humility. Outlets like British Vogue have lauded this quality in 2024 coverage of his off-duty style, portraying him as refreshingly unpretentious amid Hollywood's glamour. In 2025 profiles tied to *Frankenstein* and Australian projects, he is celebrated for maintaining a down-to-earth demeanor, such as his appreciation for homegrown cinema, which resonates as genuine amid his global ascent. This perception enhances his appeal, distinguishing him as a relatable figure in an often superficial industry.\n\n### Personal relationships and privacy\n\nElordi has been notably private about his personal life, rarely sharing details on social media, which he deactivated in November 2024 to distance himself from public scrutiny. In interviews, he has discussed how the pressures of fame, including objectifying comments and rapid online attention following *The Kissing Booth*, nearly led him to quit acting and impacted his mental health, prompting him to avoid platforms that amplify invasive speculation.\n\nAmong his high-profile relationships, Elordi dated his *The Kissing Booth* co-star Joey King from 2017 to 2018, a romance that began on set and drew early media attention. He was later linked to model Kaia Gerber from late 2020 to early 2021, with the pair spotted together at events before parting amicably. Elordi began dating influencer Olivia Jade Giannulli in 2021, a relationship marked by on-and-off periods through 2025, including a confirmed split in August 2025 and a brief reconciliation in September before ending definitively in October.\n\nAs of November 2025, Elordi is single, with no confirmed romantic partner since his most recent breakup, and he has emphasized maintaining boundaries in recent profiles to protect his well-being amid ongoing fame. Tabloid coverage of post-*Euphoria* dating rumors has included unconfirmed links to model Bianca Finch in 2022 and, more recently in late 2025, sightings with model Kristen Kiehnle, fueling speculation that Elordi has addressed by reiterating his preference for privacy over public disclosure.\n\nElordi shares a close bond with his family, including parents John, of Basque descent, and Melissa, an Australian, and his three older sisters, among them ballerina Isabella and model Jalynn. He has made occasional joint appearances with them, such as sightseeing in Rome in June 2025 and a lighthearted interview photobomb in November 2025, but limits public sharing to preserve their privacy.\n\n## Filmography\n\n### Films\n\nElordi's early role was in the short film *Carpe Liam* (2015), where he played the lead role of Liam under director Emma Dunlop's guidance, portraying a young man navigating family dynamics in this dramatic short.\n\nIn *Swinging Safari* (2018), directed by Stephan Elliott, Elordi portrayed Rooster, a rebellious teenager in this Australian coming-of-age comedy set in 1970s suburbia, marking his feature film debut.\n\nElordi gained international recognition as Noah Flynn, the brooding bad boy love interest, in the Netflix romantic comedy *The Kissing Booth* (2018), directed by Vince Marcello, which became one of the platform's most popular original films.\n\nHe reprised the role of Noah Flynn in *The Kissing Booth 2* (2020), again directed by Vince Marcello, where the character deals with long-distance challenges amid college transitions in this sequel that continued the franchise's streaming popularity.\n\nElordi closed out the trilogy as Noah Flynn in *The Kissing Booth 3: One Last Kiss* (2021), directed by Vince Marcello, focusing on post-high school decisions and relationships, with the film achieving similar viewership success on Netflix.\n\nIn *2 Hearts* (2020), directed by Lance Hool, Elordi played Chris Gregory, a young man facing health struggles in this romantic drama inspired by true events about interconnected lives and organ donation.\n\nElordi appeared as Charlie De Lisle, one of the wife's lovers, in the erotic thriller *Deep Water* (2022), directed by Adrian Lyne, which explores a troubled marriage and jealousy, released simultaneously on Hulu in the U.S. and Prime Video internationally.\n\nHe starred as the charismatic Felix Catton in Emerald Fennell's black comedy thriller *Saltburn* (2023), portraying an Oxford student entangled in class intrigue and obsession, which premiered at the Telluride Film Festival and became a major streaming hit on Prime Video.\n\nIn Sofia Coppola's biographical drama *Priscilla* (2023), Elordi embodied Elvis Presley opposite Cailee Spaeny's Priscilla, chronicling their relationship from meeting to marriage, with the film premiering in competition at the Venice Film Festival.\n\nElordi played Ian, a British actor involved in an indie film project, in the satirical road movie *The Sweet East* (2023), directed by Sean Price Williams in his feature debut, which premiered in the Directors' Fortnight section at the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nIn the crime thriller *He Went That Way* (2024), directed by Jeffrey Darling, Elordi portrayed Bobby, a hitchhiking serial killer who forms an uneasy bond with a TV star, serving as an executive producer; based on a true 1964 incident and premiering at the Tribeca Film Festival.\n\nElordi played young Leonard Fife in Paul Schrader's drama *Oh, Canada* (2024), opposite Richard Gere as the older version of the character, exploring themes of confession and legacy.\n\nIn the romantic drama *On Swift Horses* (2024), directed by Daniel Minahan, Elordi portrayed Julius, a poker player in 1950s America, in this adaptation of Shannon Pufahl's novel.\n\nElordi took on the role of the Creature in Guillermo del Toro's adaptation *Frankenstein* (2025), a gothic horror reimagining of Mary Shelley's novel starring opposite Oscar Isaac as Victor Frankenstein, released on Netflix following a limited theatrical run.\n\n### Television\n\nElordi's television career began with his breakout role in the HBO series *Euphoria*, where he portrayed Nate Jacobs, a volatile high school athlete grappling with issues of toxic masculinity, family pressure, and abusive relationships.
