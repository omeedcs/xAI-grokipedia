# Jair Bolsonaro

Jair Messias Bolsonaro (born 21 March 1955) is a Brazilian politician and retired captain in the Brazilian Army who served as the 38th president of Brazil from 1 January 2019 to 1 January 2023.  
A career military officer who graduated from the Brazilian Army's Agulhas Negras Military Academy and served for 17 years including as a paratrooper, Bolsonaro entered politics in the 1980s, gaining notoriety for criticizing low military pay and later serving 28 years as a federal congressman from Rio de Janeiro known for his outspoken defense of law and order, family values, and opposition to leftist policies.  
Elected president in 2018 amid widespread corruption scandals exposed by Operation Car Wash and public disillusionment with the Workers' Party governments, his administration prioritized economic liberalization, including a landmark pension system overhaul to address fiscal deficits, deregulation to attract investment, and efforts to privatize state-owned enterprises, contributing to GDP growth averaging around 1.5% annually post-recession recovery despite the COVID-19 downturn.  
Bolsonaro's government emphasized personal responsibility over lockdowns during the pandemic, distributing emergency aid to millions while keeping the economy operational, though this approach drew international scrutiny amid high death tolls attributed by critics to vaccine skepticism and delayed restrictions; empirically, Brazil's excess mortality aligned with regional peers when adjusted for demographics and healthcare access.  
On environmental policy, his push to integrate the Amazon economy through legal mining and agribusiness expansion reduced bureaucratic hurdles for development but correlated with elevated deforestation rates, challenging global narratives by highlighting underreported illegal logging under prior administrations and Brazil's overall forest cover stability.  
Post-presidency, Bolsonaro has faced multiple legal investigations and a 2025 conviction for alleged coup plotting related to 2023 election unrest, which he denies, maintaining strong support among conservatives who view him as a bulwark against socialism and institutional corruption.

## Early Life and Military Career

### Childhood and Family Background

Jair Messias Bolsonaro was born on March 21, 1955, in Glicério, a rural municipality in the interior of São Paulo state, Brazil.  His birth was registered months later in Campinas, also in São Paulo state. The name "Jair" was chosen at the suggestion of a neighbor, honoring Jair Rosa Pinto, a Brazilian footballer who shared his birthday.

He was the third of six children—three sons and three daughters—born to Percy Geraldo Bolsonaro and Olinda Bonturi Bolsonaro.  His family traced its roots primarily to Italian immigrants from the provinces of Veneto and Calabria, with additional German ancestry. The Bolsonaros, descendants of post-World War II Italian migrants, frequently relocated within São Paulo state during his early years. In 1966, the family settled in Eldorado, a small town of approximately 15,000 residents in southern São Paulo, where Bolsonaro spent his childhood and teenage years until age 18.  

Percy Geraldo Bolsonaro (1927–1995), his father, worked as a dental technician and practiced dentistry without formal certification, supplementing income through gold prospecting in the region.  Olinda Bonturi Bolsonaro, his mother, managed the household; she remained in Eldorado into her later years. The family's modest circumstances reflected the rural, working-class environment of Eldorado, shaped by agriculture, mining, and small-scale services during Brazil's military regime era. 

### Military Service and Promotions

Jair Bolsonaro began his military service in the Brazilian Army on March 8, 1973, enrolling at the Escola Preparatória de Cadetes do Exército (EsPCEx) in Campinas, São Paulo, at the age of 17. Following preparatory training, he was admitted to the Academia Militar das Agulhas Negras (AMAN) in Resende, Rio de Janeiro, where he underwent officer formation. In July 1977, he completed the basic paratrooper course, and by December 1977, he was commissioned as an aspirant officer upon graduating from AMAN.

Bolsonaro's early active service focused on airborne operations, serving with the 9th Parachute Infantry Brigade based in Rio de Janeiro from 1977 to 1988. He progressed through the standard officer ranks: from aspirant to second lieutenant, first lieutenant, and ultimately captain, reflecting typical advancement timelines in the Brazilian Army where promotions occur after required service periods and evaluations, generally every 2-4 years for junior officers. His tenure included assignments in artillery and infantry units, emphasizing paratrooper duties, though specific promotion dates beyond commissioning are not publicly detailed in official records.

In 1986, as a captain, Bolsonaro gained attention for advocating military pay increases, authoring articles under a pseudonym in *O Journal do Brasil* that criticized inadequate remuneration for officers, which led to a military inquiry and temporary detention for indiscipline. Despite this, he continued service until March 31, 1988, when he was transferred to the reserve at the rank of captain after approximately 15 years of active duty. This retirement coincided with his entry into politics, leveraging his military background to launch a campaign for Rio de Janeiro city council.

## Pre-Presidential Political Career

### Rio de Janeiro City Councilor (1989–1991)

Bolsonaro entered politics by winning election to the Rio de Janeiro City Council in the November 1988 municipal elections, representing the Christian Democratic Party (PDC). His term officially commenced on January 1, 1989, and was set to run until the end of the legislative period in 1992, but lasted only until January 31, 1991.

During his tenure, Bolsonaro introduced seven legislative proposals, primarily addressing benefits for military personnel, including Projeto de Lei 113/89 presented on April 20, 1989, which sought to provide free public transportation for troops.  None of these projects advanced to enactment. Contemporaries described him as a low-profile councilor who engaged sparingly in debates and committee work, maintaining a discreet presence amid a council dominated by established political figures.

Bolsonaro's municipal service ended prematurely following his election as a federal deputy for Rio de Janeiro in October 1990, prompting his resignation from the council to take up the congressional seat in February 1991. This short stint marked his initial foray into elected office, leveraging prior military publicity to gain entry, though yielding limited legislative impact.

### Federal Deputy for Rio de Janeiro (1991–2018)

Bolsonaro was elected as a federal deputy for Rio de Janeiro in the October 3, 1990, parliamentary elections, representing the Democratic Party (PDC), securing one of the state's seats in the Chamber of Deputies for the 1991–1995 term. He took office on February 1, 1991, and maintained continuous re-elections in 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006, 2010, and 2014, serving seven consecutive terms until January 2019. Throughout this period, he affiliated with multiple parties, including the Brazilian Progressive Party (PPB) from 1995 to 2003, the Progressive Party (PP) from 2003 to 2005 and 2016 to 2017, the Brazilian Labor Party (PTB) briefly in 2005, the Liberal Front of National Work (now Democrats) from 2010 to 2014, and the Social Christian Party (PSC) from 2014 to 2018, reflecting strategic shifts amid Brazil's fragmented party system.

His legislative output was limited, with approximately 171 projects introduced over 27 years, of which only two were approved as laws. One notable success came in 2015, when an amendment he authored was incorporated into a broader bill after 25 years in office, marking his first such achievement. The low passage rate stemmed from the nature of his proposals, which often targeted niche issues like military pensions, opposition to public funding for certain social programs, and enhancements to public security measures, facing resistance in a Congress dominated by centrist and left-leaning coalitions. Despite minimal enacted legislation, Bolsonaro prioritized vocal advocacy in plenary sessions and media, critiquing perceived leftist influences in education and culture, defending the 1964–1985 military regime's legacy against what he termed historical revisionism, and pushing for stricter penalties on crime.

Bolsonaro's tenure emphasized defense of armed forces' interests, including repeated proposals for salary parity between military and civilian public servants, and resistance to policies he viewed as eroding traditional family structures, such as bills against mandatory diversity quotas or expansions of rights for non-traditional partnerships. He supported Dilma Rousseff's impeachment by filing a request in March 2015 and voting in favor in 2016, aligning with conservative blocs on fiscal conservatism and anti-corruption probes into the Workers' Party administrations. His approach garnered increasing electoral support in Rio de Janeiro, topping the state's deputy vote tallies in later elections due to appeals on law-and-order themes amid rising urban violence, though critics from academic and media outlets—often aligned with progressive institutions—highlighted his sparse committee participation and reliance on provocative rhetoric over substantive lawmaking. This style, while yielding few policy wins, built a dedicated base skeptical of mainstream political establishments.
## 2018 Presidential Campaign and Election

### Campaign Platform and Strategy

Bolsonaro's 2018 presidential campaign platform focused on combating entrenched corruption, bolstering public security amid rampant violence, enacting market-oriented economic reforms to address fiscal imbalances and stagnation, and defending traditional moral and family structures against perceived leftist encroachments in education and culture. He presented himself as an uncorrupted alternative to the establishment, highlighting his lack of involvement in scandals like Operation Car Wash (Lava Jato), which had implicated numerous politicians from prior administrations, including Workers' Party leaders. This anti-corruption stance resonated in a context of widespread disillusionment, as Brazil's political class faced over 100 indictments from Lava Jato probes by mid-2018.

On security, the platform advocated aggressive policies to curb Brazil's homicide rate, which averaged over 59,000 deaths annually from 2014 to 2016, including proposals to lower the age of criminal majority from 18 to 16, facilitate civilian firearm ownership for self-defense, and expand police operational freedom—even endorsing lethal force against criminals when necessary to deter organized crime. Economically, Bolsonaro pledged to privatize inefficient state firms, reform the unsustainable pension system burdened by deficits exceeding 8% of GDP, and reduce bureaucratic interference to revive growth after the 2014–2016 recession that shrank GDP by over 7%. He aligned with Chicago School-inspired ideas through his selection of Paulo Guedes as economic advisor, emphasizing deregulation and fiscal austerity over redistributive spending.

The platform also emphasized cultural conservatism, promoting "traditional family values" and opposing curricula promoting gender and sexual orientation topics in schools, which Bolsonaro criticized as ideological indoctrination; this appealed to Brazil's growing evangelical demographic, comprising about 25% of voters by 2018. Campaign rhetoric invoked the slogan "Brazil above everything, God above all," framing policies as a restoration of national sovereignty and Judeo-Christian principles against socialism and globalism.

Strategically, Bolsonaro minimized reliance on mainstream media, which he and supporters viewed as hostile due to coverage favoring left-leaning candidates, instead leveraging social media platforms—particularly Facebook, Twitter, and WhatsApp—for direct voter outreach. This digital ecosystem facilitated viral dissemination of short videos, infographics, and forwarded messages critiquing corruption and crime, reaching millions via WhatsApp groups that amplified anti-establishment narratives and countered opponent attacks. By August 2018, his online following exceeded 10 million on Facebook alone, enabling a low-cost, grassroots mobilization that propelled him from third-place polls in early 2018 to 46.03% in the October 7 first round. The approach capitalized on post-Lava Jato voter anger, portraying the election as a binary choice between continuity of the "corrupt system" and radical renewal, while alliances with military figures and evangelicals broadened his coalition beyond traditional right-wing bases.

### Assassination Attempt

On September 6, 2018, during a campaign rally in Juiz de Fora, Minas Gerais, Jair Bolsonaro, then a presidential candidate, was stabbed in the abdomen by Adélio Bispo de Oliveira, a 40-year-old former metalworker. The attack occurred amid a crowd of supporters, with Oliveira approaching Bolsonaro under the pretense of shaking hands before thrusting a 3.5 cm blade into his intestines, causing a 2–3 cm laceration. Bolsonaro sustained severe internal injuries, including perforations to his small intestine, mesentery, and a hepatic lesion, leading to significant blood loss estimated at more than 2 liters. Oliveira had previously been affiliated with the Socialism and Liberty Party (PSOL) from 2007 to 2014.

Emergency surgery at Santa Casa de Misericórdia hospital in Juiz de Fora lasted approximately 4 hours, involving the resection of 30 cm of damaged intestine and the administration of 4 units of blood. Bolsonaro was transferred to São Paulo's Albert Einstein Hospital on September 7 for further treatment, undergoing three additional surgeries over the following weeks to address complications such as peritonitis and a bile leak, during which he received a total of 38 units of blood products. He remained hospitalized until September 29, 2018, and reported ongoing health effects, including reduced digestive capacity requiring dietary restrictions.

Oliveira was arrested immediately after the attack and confessed to acting alone, citing personal animosity toward Bolsonaro's political positions and stating he acted on divine orders. Federal police investigations concluded Oliveira had no accomplices, attributing the motive to mental instability; he had a history of psychiatric treatment, including diagnoses of paranoid psychosis and delusional disorder, and was deemed unfit for trial in 2019 due to incompetence. His legal defense was funded by anonymous individuals whose identities were protected by attorney-client privilege. Despite Bolsonaro and supporters alleging possible political orchestration—pointing to Oliveira's affiliation with PSOL from 2007 to 2014 and mosque funding links—no evidence of conspiracy was substantiated by authorities, though forensic accounting revealed unexplained cash deposits of R$10,000 in Oliveira's accounts shortly before the incident. In the aftermath of the attack, some left-wing groups and online activists circulated false claims alleging that the stabbing had been staged, despite medical and police evidence confirming it; notably, former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and other politicians from the Workers' Party (PT) publicly promoted these claims.

The assassination attempt galvanized Bolsonaro's campaign, boosting his poll numbers from around 30% to leading the first-round vote on October 7, 2018, as supporters framed it as an attack by political opponents. Bolsonaro, recovering, conducted the remainder of the campaign via video messages and phone calls, declining debates, and won the presidency in the second round on October 28, 2018. Medical experts noted the injury's potential lethality, with a survival probability estimated below 30% due to the blade's depth and vascular damage.
### Election Victory and Inauguration

In the second round of the 2018 Brazilian presidential election held on October 28, Bolsonaro secured victory with 55.13% of the valid votes, totaling 57,797,847 ballots, against 44.87% or 47,038,348 votes for Workers' Party candidate Fernando Haddad. The first round on October 7 had seen Bolsonaro lead with 46.03% of the vote, insufficient for an outright win, prompting the runoff after Haddad advanced as the second-place finisher. Voter turnout in the runoff reached 79.68% of eligible voters, reflecting widespread participation amid economic discontent and fallout from corruption investigations like Operation Car Wash, which had implicated prior administrations. Brazil's Superior Electoral Court officially validated the results on October 30, 2018, confirming Bolsonaro's election without reported irregularities in the electronic voting system.

Bolsonaro's campaign emphasized anti-corruption measures, economic liberalization, and law-and-order policies, resonating with voters frustrated by rising crime rates—homicides had surged to over 60,000 annually by 2017—and perceived governmental inefficiency under the preceding Workers' Party-led governments. His Social Liberal Party (PSL) also benefited from strategic alliances and a surge in congressional seats, securing 52 of 513 in the lower house, bolstering his mandate. International observers noted the election as a pivot away from leftist governance, with Bolsonaro's win marking the first conservative presidency since the end of military rule in 1985.

On January 1, 2019, Bolsonaro was inaugurated as Brazil's 38th president in Brasília, beginning with a swearing-in ceremony at the National Congress where he took the constitutional oath to preserve, defend, and enforce the 1988 Constitution. Vice President Hamilton Mourão, a retired army general, was similarly sworn in, completing the executive transition from outgoing President Michel Temer. The proceedings included a procession to the Planalto Presidential Palace for the official handover, attended by foreign dignitaries but marked by Bolsonaro's decision to forgo the traditional Catholic Mass, opting instead for a direct focus on governmental continuity.

Security was exceptionally tight, with thousands of troops, snipers, and anti-aircraft defenses deployed due to the September 2018 assassination attempt on Bolsonaro, which had required multiple surgeries. In his inaugural address to supporters from an open-top vehicle and later at the palace, Bolsonaro declared the event as Brazil's "liberation from socialism, inverted values, the bloated state, and political correctness," pledging to prioritize "God, fatherland, family, and freedom" while vowing zero tolerance for corruption and criminality. The speech underscored his intent to reverse prior policies, signaling reforms in security, economy, and bureaucracy from his first day in office.

## Presidency (2019–2022)

### Economic Policies and Reforms

Upon assuming office in January 2019, Jair Bolsonaro appointed Paulo Guedes, a University of Chicago-trained economist advocating market-oriented policies, as Minister of Economy to spearhead liberalization efforts including pension overhaul, tax simplification, bureaucratic reduction, and asset sales. The administration's flagship initiative was the 2019 pension reform, enacted on October 13 after congressional approval, which raised minimum retirement ages to 65 for men and 62 for women, introduced minimum contributions of 20 years, and shifted toward defined-benefit structures to curb escalating deficits exceeding R$194 billion annually. Government projections estimated R$800 billion in savings over the subsequent decade, though amendments for hazardous occupations tempered the total from an initial R$1.2 trillion forecast.

Privatization drives under Guedes targeted state-owned enterprises to reduce fiscal burdens and attract investment, achieving partial successes such as divesting non-core assets and concessions in infrastructure, but faced congressional hurdles blocking full sales of giants like Petrobras and Eletrobras, resulting in limited overall divestment relative to ambitions. Complementary measures included a 2019 fiscal responsibility law amendment enforcing spending caps and efforts to streamline regulations, though broader tax and administrative reforms stalled amid political negotiations.

The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted trajectories, prompting Bolsonaro's government to launch emergency cash transfers—Auxílio Emergencial—starting April 2020 at up to R$1,200 monthly for vulnerable households, extended through 2020 and tapered in 2021, which mitigated poverty spikes but swelled public debt from 75.8% of GDP in 2019 to over 88% by 2020. Economic indicators reflected initial pre-pandemic stabilization with 1.2% GDP growth in 2019 and unemployment dipping below 12%, followed by a 3.9% contraction in 2020, rebounding to 5% growth in 2021 amid recovery and aid-fueled consumption, though inflation surged to double digits in 2021 due to commodity pressures and supply disruptions. Unemployment peaked at 14.2% mid-2020 before falling to 8.1% by late 2022, bolstered by informal sector resurgence but highlighting persistent structural vulnerabilities. These policies, while advancing fiscal discipline in pensions, underscored tensions between orthodox restraint and pandemic exigencies, with critics attributing inflationary legacies to expansive aid and proponents crediting reforms for averting deeper insolvency.

### Public Security and Anti-Corruption Measures

During his presidency, Jair Bolsonaro prioritized public security through measures emphasizing armed self-defense, police empowerment, and federal intervention against organized crime. In January 2019, shortly after inauguration, he issued decrees deregulating firearm possession and carry permits, expanding access to semi-automatic weapons previously restricted to military use and increasing the validity of registrations from five to ten years. These changes, numbering over a dozen by 2022, resulted in a surge in legal gun ownership, rising 65% in the first two years to approximately 1.3 million registered firearms. Proponents attributed a subsequent decline in violent crime to greater civilian deterrence, with Brazil's national homicide rate dropping 34% from 2018 levels to 18.5 per 100,000 inhabitants by 2021, reaching the lowest recorded since systematic tracking began. Critics, including security think tanks, argued the trend predated his administration—homicides had already begun falling from a 2017 peak—and warned that flooded legal markets could arm criminals via diversion, though empirical data showed no homicide spike post-deregulation.

Bolsonaro's government also bolstered law enforcement by increasing federal funding for state police operations and proposing legislation to limit prosecutions of officers for on-duty killings deemed "unfair aggression" responses, aiming to reduce perceived judicial overreach inhibiting policing. In 2019, the administration launched coordinated federal actions against drug trafficking and militias in high-crime regions like Rio de Janeiro, deploying military personnel under the federal intervention framework extended from prior years. These efforts correlated with stabilized or reduced violent crime in targeted areas, though overall declines were part of a multi-year trajectory influenced by state-level pacification units and socioeconomic factors beyond federal policy.

On anti-corruption, Bolsonaro campaigned as a Lava Jato champion, appointing operation lead judge Sergio Moro as Justice Minister in January 2019 to institutionalize probe-derived reforms like plea bargains and asset forfeiture. Under this tenure, Lava Jato continued, yielding convictions and recovering billions in illicit funds through 2020, while proposed constitutional amendments sought to expedite corruption trials and restrict statutes of limitations. Brazil's Corruption Perceptions Index score improved marginally from 35 in 2018-2019 to 38 in 2020, reflecting sustained prosecutorial momentum. However, Moro resigned in April 2020, alleging political interference in police investigations, including pressure to replace a Federal Police chief probing Bolsonaro allies; subsequent leaks and Supreme Court rulings curtailed Lava Jato's scope, leading to its effective dissolution by 2021. The administration faced accusations of shielding family members and appointees from probes, contributing to perceptions of selective enforcement, though no direct presidential indictments emerged during the term. By 2022, the CPI score held at 38, indicating stasis amid institutional pushback against aggressive anti-corruption tactics.

### Foreign Policy and International Relations

Bolsonaro's foreign policy marked a departure from Brazil's traditional multilateralism and non-alignment, emphasizing ideological affinities with conservative governments, anti-communism, and national sovereignty over globalist institutions. The administration prioritized bilateral relations with the United States under President Donald Trump, aligning on issues such as opposition to Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and support for Israel, while rhetorically criticizing multilateral bodies like the United Nations. Despite initial promises of de-ideologization, policy often reflected Bolsonaro's personal views, leading to tensions with partners prioritizing environmental and human rights concerns, though pragmatic economic interests preserved key trade ties.

Relations with the United States were closest during Trump's presidency, with Bolsonaro visiting the White House on March 19, 2019, to discuss bilateral trade, defense cooperation, and regional security, including joint support for Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó. The two leaders coordinated on containing Chinese influence and restraining Iran, with Brazil purchasing U.S. military equipment and exploring 5G partnerships excluding Huawei. Tensions arose after Joe Biden's 2020 election; Bolsonaro delayed recognizing the results, citing fraud claims similar to his own domestic rhetoric, and relations cooled over Amazon deforestation and the January 6 Capitol events, though a June 2022 meeting at the Summit of the Americas yielded limited agreements on biofuels and trade.

Toward China, Bolsonaro's administration balanced anti-communist rhetoric—labeling it a threat during the 2018 campaign—with economic pragmatism, as China remained Brazil's largest trading partner, with bilateral trade reaching $98.9 billion in 2019, driven by soybean and iron ore exports. No major ruptures occurred; Huawei was restricted in 5G networks under U.S. pressure, but broader decoupling was avoided due to military and economic advisors' influence favoring continuity. In Latin America, Bolsonaro adopted a hardline stance against Maduro's regime, recognizing Guaidó as interim president in January 2019 and facilitating Venezuelan refugee entry despite border strains, while withdrawing from the UN Global Compact on Migration on January 9, 2019, citing sovereignty concerns over mass inflows.

European Union relations deteriorated amid criticisms of Brazil's environmental policies, with leaders like Germany's Angela Merkel and France's Emmanuel Macron condemning Amazon fires and deforestation rates that surged 34% in Bolsonaro's first year, leading to threats of trade penalties under the EU-Mercosur agreement signed in June 2019 but stalled by environmental clauses. Bolsonaro reciprocated by accusing Europeans of neocolonialism and prioritizing "Brazil first" sovereignty. In contrast, ties with Israel strengthened, with Bolsonaro opening a trade office in Jerusalem in March 2019—stopping short of full embassy relocation—and visiting multiple times, fostering defense and agricultural cooperation aligned with evangelical voter bases.

Bolsonaro's skepticism of international agreements manifested in withdrawing from the UN migration pact and reneging on hosting the 2019 UN climate talks (COP25) in November 2018, citing costs and misalignment with development priorities, though Brazil remained in the Paris Agreement without formal exit. At the 2019 G20 summit in Osaka, hosted under Japanese presidency, Bolsonaro defended national interests on trade and migration, while later criticizing the World Health Organization during COVID-19 for undue influence. These moves prioritized ideological resistance to perceived globalist overreach but strained Brazil's soft power, with pragmatic elements ensuring no collapse in core economic partnerships.

### COVID-19 Response and Public Health

Bolsonaro's administration responded to the COVID-19 pandemic, which reached Brazil with confirmed cases on February 26, 2020, by prioritizing economic continuity over widespread lockdowns and social distancing measures. The president repeatedly characterized the virus as a "little flu" ("gripezinha") and argued that quarantine restrictions posed greater risks to livelihoods than the disease itself, advocating for a return to normalcy to avoid unemployment and poverty.  In illustration of these concerns, during the pandemic in 2020, Bolsonaro met with Supreme Court Justice Gilmar Mendes at the Palácio da Alvorada on a Saturday morning, where he showed WhatsApp videos of small business owners affected by restrictions, such as a lottery shop owner facing closure, and became emotional, crying while venting about the destruction of businesses and jobs, as well as difficulties including attacks on his family. Mendes later revealed the encounter in a July 2024 interview. He opposed mask mandates and public closures, clashing with state governors who implemented their own restrictions under authority affirmed by Brazil's Supreme Federal Court, reflecting the country's decentralized health system where states and municipalities held significant implementation power.

Tensions escalated with federal health leadership, leading to the dismissal of Health Minister Luiz Henrique Mandetta on April 16, 2020, after public disagreements over social distancing and testing protocols; Mandetta favored WHO-aligned precautions, while Bolsonaro prioritized reopening businesses like gyms and salons.  His successor, Nelson Teich, resigned on May 15, 2020, citing irreconcilable differences on lockdown opposition and drug protocols.  General Eduardo Pazuello then assumed the role in an interim capacity from May 2020, aligning more closely with Bolsonaro's emphasis on "early treatment" kits including hydroxychloroquine, despite emerging evidence from clinical trials showing no efficacy against COVID-19 and potential cardiac risks.  The government distributed millions of doses of hydroxychloroquine, sourced partly from India and produced domestically, as a core strategy, even as international bodies like the WHO halted related trials due to futility. 

Brazil recorded over 700,000 official COVID-19 deaths by late 2022, second globally after the United States, with peaks including nearly 87,000 daily cases reported on April 7, 2021, amid variants like Gamma.  Excess mortality estimates suggested underreporting, exacerbated by strained hospitals and temporary federal data halts in June 2020, when the health ministry removed daily updates from its site, prompting accusations of opacity though numbers were later restored following court orders.  Bolsonaro's public appearances without masks and handshakes with crowds contrasted with his eventual contraction of the virus in July 2020, after which he self-treated with hydroxychloroquine.

On vaccination, Bolsonaro expressed skepticism, publicly stating he would not receive one and delaying federal procurement of Pfizer doses in 2020 while criticizing mRNA technology; however, Brazil's National Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA) approved vaccines like CoronaVac and AstraZeneca independently, enabling states—particularly São Paulo's Butantan Institute and federal Fiocruz production—to drive rollout.  By mid-2022, over 80% of the population was fully vaccinated, surpassing global averages, though federal tardiness contributed to early shortages. Broader public health efforts under his tenure included expanded emergency aid via Auxílio Emergencial payments to 68 million beneficiaries, mitigating economic fallout but fueling inflation concerns, while pre-existing issues like regional healthcare disparities in favelas amplified vulnerabilities.
### Environmental and Indigenous Policies

Bolsonaro's administration pursued environmental policies that prioritized agricultural expansion, mining, and infrastructure development, often at the expense of stringent conservation measures. Budgets for key agencies like IBAMA were significantly reduced, with enforcement expenditures falling to under 50% of allocated funds in 2021 compared to 86-92% in prior years.  The government also relaxed licensing requirements for projects in sensitive areas and dismissed personnel skeptical of development-driven approaches, leading to fewer inspections and fines for illegal activities. 

These changes correlated with elevated deforestation rates in the Amazon, as tracked by INPE's PRODES satellite monitoring. Annual clear-cutting rose from 7,536 km² in 2018 to 10,129 km² in 2019—a 34% increase—and peaked at around 11,568 km² in 2022, resulting in a cumulative 53% rise over the 2019-2022 period relative to the prior four years.   Forest fires and illegal logging surged correspondingly, with weakened enforcement enabling garimpo (artisanal mining) and land grabbing, though the administration attributed spikes partly to international NGOs and disputed INPE's methodology. 

On indigenous affairs, Bolsonaro's government restructured FUNAI, transferring land demarcation authority to the Agriculture Ministry via Provisional Measure 870 on January 2, 2019, which critics argued favored agribusiness interests over native claims.  No new indigenous territories were fully demarcated during his term, halting progress on approximately 237 pending processes and exacerbating encroachments by loggers and miners—contrasting with prior administrations that advanced dozens.  

Legislative efforts included support for Bill PL 191/2020, enacted in 2020, which authorized commercial mining, hydroelectric dams, and rice cultivation on indigenous lands, framed by proponents as fostering economic self-sufficiency and integration rather than isolation.  A 2020 FUNAI regulation further permitted private property registrations within undemarcated indigenous areas, heightening vulnerabilities to irregular certifications and invasions.  Bolsonaro consistently advocated viewing indigenous groups as hindrances to progress, proposing their assimilation into urban economies and rejecting expansive reservations as incompatible with national sovereignty and development needs. 

### 2022 Re-Election Campaign and Transition

Bolsonaro officially launched his re-election campaign on July 25, 2022, in Rio de Janeiro, selecting former Defense Minister Walter Braga Netto as his running mate under the Liberal Party (PL) banner. The platform emphasized continuity of his administration's policies, highlighting economic recovery with GDP growth of 4.6% in 2021 and unemployment falling to 7.9% by mid-2022, alongside public security gains from expanded police operations that reduced homicides by 20% since 2018. Bolsonaro positioned himself against the return of the Workers' Party (PT), criticizing opponent Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva's past convictions for corruption—overturned in 2021 on procedural grounds—and promising to sustain fiscal reforms, privatizations, and anti-crime measures while expanding social welfare through the Auxílio Brasil program, which reached 18 million families.

The first round of voting on October 2, 2022, saw Bolsonaro secure 43.20% of the valid votes (49.1 million), trailing Lula's 48.43% (57.3 million), necessitating a runoff as neither achieved a majority. Campaigning intensified with large rallies, including motorcycle convoys drawing hundreds of thousands, where Bolsonaro reiterated claims of vulnerabilities in Brazil's electronic voting system—noting limitations in prior audits and military reviews, such as restricted access to full source code and cryptographic components that prevented comprehensive verification, though no evidence of fraud or irregularities was identified—and vowed to uphold democratic institutions while decrying media bias and judicial overreach. In the October 30 runoff, TSE-certified results showed Lula victorious with 50.90% (60.3 million votes) to Bolsonaro's 49.10% (58.2 million), a margin of 1.8 percentage points or approximately 2.1 million votes, with Bolsonaro performing strongly in agribusiness regions and urban peripheries but underperforming in the Northeast.

On election night, Bolsonaro did not immediately concede, instead issuing a statement the following day, November 1, 2022, acknowledging the vote count while questioning its legitimacy without evidence and directing supporters to avoid violence, though he agreed to initiate the transition process. Transition meetings between teams proceeded amid tensions, with Bolsonaro's administration handing over policy dossiers on economy, security, and foreign affairs, but he departed Brazil for the United States on December 30, 2022, citing personal reasons and skipping Lula's January 1, 2023, inauguration. Supporters' protests escalated post-election, including blockades and camps in Brasília, culminating in the January 8, 2023, invasion of government buildings by thousands demanding military intervention, an event Bolsonaro later condemned but which authorities linked to rhetoric from his circle challenging electoral integrity. The Superior Electoral Court (TSE) affirmed the election's integrity, noting no irregularities in over 500 million votes cast via audited electronic urns, as corroborated by international observers including the Carter Center.
## Post-Presidency (2023–Present)

### Political Influence and Party Activities

Following his defeat in the 2022 presidential election, Jair Bolsonaro maintained significant influence within Brazil's conservative political spectrum through his affiliation with the Partido Liberal (PL), which served as the primary vehicle for his supporters. The PL, under Bolsonaro's informal leadership, expanded its congressional representation during the 2022 elections, securing 99 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and 13 in the Senate, reflecting the enduring appeal of his platform among voters opposed to leftist policies. This base enabled the party to sustain momentum despite Bolsonaro's ineligibility to run for office until 2030, as ruled by Brazil's Superior Electoral Court in June 2023 for abuse of media power during the campaign.

In the 2024 municipal elections, the PL achieved notable success, winning 1,059 mayoral positions in the first round on October 6, more than any other party, which analysts attributed to the persistence of "bolsonarismo" as a mobilizing force against the Workers' Party (PT) administration.  Bolsonaro actively endorsed PL-aligned candidates, contributing to victories in key cities and reinforcing the party's role as the institutional embodiment of his ideological movement, even as some voters favored moderate conservatives over more radical figures. Polling data from 2025 indicated that Bolsonaro retained a core following, with his approval among right-leaning voters influencing party nominations and strategies ahead of future national contests.

Bolsonaro engaged directly in party activities through public rallies and advocacy, using these events to rally supporters and criticize ongoing investigations against him. In March 2025, he addressed a crowd in Rio de Janeiro, demanding amnesty for participants in the January 8, 2023, Brasília unrest and pledging continued political engagement. Similar gatherings occurred in June 2025 in São Paulo, where he protested Supreme Court proceedings, and in September 2025 across multiple cities including Brasília and Porto Alegre, drawing tens of thousands ahead of his coup plot verdict.  These mobilizations underscored his ability to sustain grassroots energy within the PL, even amid legal constraints that limited his formal candidacy but not his rhetorical sway over the party's direction.

### Legal Challenges and Investigations

Following his departure from office on January 1, 2023, Jair Bolsonaro became subject to several high-profile legal proceedings in Brazil's electoral and supreme courts, centered on allegations of electoral misconduct and attempts to undermine the 2022 election results. These cases, overseen by institutions such as the Superior Electoral Court (TSE) and the Supreme Federal Court (STF), have drawn accusations from Bolsonaro's supporters of judicial overreach and political persecution, while prosecutors cited evidence of organized efforts to challenge democratic processes.

On June 30, 2023, the TSE unanimously ruled Bolsonaro ineligible to hold public office for eight years, until 2030, finding that he abused presidential authority and disseminated false information about Brazil's electronic voting system. The decision stemmed from a July 18, 2022, meeting where Bolsonaro presented unsubstantiated claims of widespread fraud to foreign ambassadors, using official resources to cast doubt on the electoral process ahead of the October runoff. The court determined this constituted misuse of media and an attack on institutional integrity, disqualifying both Bolsonaro and his running mate, Walter Braga Netto, under Brazil's electoral purity laws. Bolsonaro appealed the ruling, maintaining that his criticisms were based on legitimate concerns over voting transparency, but the TSE upheld the ban.

A more expansive investigation by the Federal Police and STF focused on an alleged coup plot to prevent President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva's inauguration after Bolsonaro's narrow defeat on October 30, 2022. The probe, intensified following the January 8, 2023, riots in Brasília where protesters stormed government buildings, implicated Bolsonaro and over 30 associates, including former ministers and military officers, in planning to declare martial law or annul the election. Evidence included draft decrees for military intervention and discussions of arresting STF justices, as detailed in police reports released in November 2023 and February 2025. On February 19, 2025, Prosecutor-General Paulo Gonet charged Bolsonaro with leading an armed criminal organization and attempting the violent abolition of the democratic rule of law.

The STF trial, conducted by a five-justice panel from September 2 to 11, 2025, resulted in Bolsonaro's conviction on five counts, including participation in an armed group and coup orchestration, with a sentence of 27 years and three months in prison. Four justices voted for conviction, citing digital communications and witness testimonies as proof of orchestration, while one dissented on procedural grounds. Prior to the verdict, on August 5, 2025, the STF imposed house arrest on Bolsonaro for violating restrictions, such as unauthorized travel, amid heightened police surveillance. Bolsonaro has denied orchestrating any illegal acts, asserting he pursued only constitutional challenges to election irregularities and framing the proceedings as retaliation by a judiciary aligned against his administration. The conviction remains subject to appeal before the full STF.

Additional inquiries have examined Bolsonaro's role in spreading disinformation about voting machines and COVID-19 vaccines, though these overlap with the TSE and STF cases. For instance, separate probes into potential falsification of vaccination records and misuse of public funds continue in lower courts, but no convictions had been reported as of October 2025. These proceedings have heightened tensions between Bolsonaro's conservative base and Brazil's judicial establishment, with critics arguing the cases reflect selective enforcement amid broader institutional distrust.

On November 22, 2025—mere hours before his arrest—Bolsonaro tampered with his electronic ankle monitor using a soldering iron. Brazilian authorities described the action as a clear indicator of his intent to break free from house arrest and flee the country. Bolsonaro confessed to the tampering, claiming it was done out of curiosity.
## Political Ideology and Positions

### Economic Liberalism and Fiscal Responsibility

Jair Bolsonaro's economic approach emphasized market-oriented reforms, appointing Paulo Guedes, a Chicago-trained economist advocating privatization and deregulation, as Minister of Economy in January 2019 to lead a "super-ministry" consolidating fiscal, planning, and trade functions. Guedes promoted reducing state intervention, with Bolsonaro endorsing policies to shrink government size and attract investment through liberalization. This aligned with Bolsonaro's campaign pledges for fiscal discipline, including adherence to the 2016 constitutional spending cap limiting federal expenditure growth to inflation rates.

A cornerstone was the 2019 pension reform, enacted via Constitutional Amendment 103 on November 13, 2019, which established minimum retirement ages of 65 for men and 62 for women, extended contribution periods for full benefits, and shifted public servants to defined-contribution plans. The overhaul projected savings of over 800 billion reais (approximately $160 billion at the time) in federal spending over a decade by curbing deficits driven by pensions consuming over 40% of the budget. Despite congressional resistance, the reform passed with Senate approval 60-19, marking a rare structural adjustment amid Brazil's history of failed attempts. Empirical analyses indicate it enhanced system progressivity and equity, though reducing overall redistributive adequacy for lower-income retirees.

Fiscal responsibility efforts included granting operational independence to the Central Bank in February 2021 via Complementary Law 179, aiming to insulate monetary policy from political interference and combat inflation, which averaged 3.7% in 2019 but surged to 10.1% by 2021 amid global pressures. Privatization initiatives advanced selectively, with the partial sale of Eletrobras in June 2022 raising 33.7 billion reais ($6.7 billion), though broader asset sales faced legislative hurdles. The administration maintained the spending cap initially, contributing to primary deficits narrowing from 1.7% of GDP in 2018 to projected surpluses pre-COVID, but emergency pandemic aid—totaling 8% of GDP in 2020—elevated gross public debt from 75.8% of GDP in 2019 to 88.8% in 2020.

By 2022, political maneuvers to boost reelection chances, such as recalibrating the spending cap formula to permit an additional 65 billion reais annually and expanding cash transfers under Auxílio Brasil, strained fiscal anchors, leading markets to anticipate higher debt trajectories. Debt-to-GDP stabilized at around 82% by late 2021 through growth recovery—GDP expanded 1.2% in 2019, contracted 3.3% in 2020, then rebounded 5% in 2021—but persistent deficits and inflation above targets underscored tensions between reformist intent and populist spending. Overall, while pension and institutional reforms laid groundwork for sustainability, deviations for short-term relief highlighted challenges in sustaining liberalism against entrenched interests and crises.

### Social Conservatism and Family Values

Bolsonaro has consistently advocated for traditional family structures as the cornerstone of Brazilian society, asserting in his 2021 address to the United Nations General Assembly that "the traditional family is the foundation of civilization" and emphasizing the freedom to worship as essential to human liberty. He reiterated this view in September 2021, stating that Brazil has a president who believes in "family principles" and that "the traditional nuclear family is the foundation of civilization." These positions aligned with his broader social conservatism, which prioritized defending what he described as the "Brazilian family" against perceived threats from progressive ideologies.

On specific moral issues, Bolsonaro opposed abortion, viewing it as incompatible with family values, and integrated this stance into his campaign rhetoric alongside rejection of drug legalization and gender ideology. He expressed skepticism toward homosexuality within family contexts, arguing in public statements that it deviates from norms upheld by the majority of Brazilians, a position that resonated with conservative voters during his 2018 presidential run. Traditional values constituted approximately 38% of the thematic content in his Twitter campaign posts, focusing on ideas-forces that reinforced nuclear family ideals against cultural shifts.

In education policy, Bolsonaro campaigned vigorously against what he termed "gender ideology," portraying school materials on sexual diversity—such as those distributed under prior administrations—as a "gay kit" that threatened the natural binary of sexes, children, and family integrity. His administration amplified legislative efforts, ongoing since around 2014, to restrict gender and sexuality education in public schools, leading to bills and municipal laws prohibiting discussions of gender diversity or sexual orientation in curricula. In his January 2019 inauguration speech, he pledged a state-level opposition to such ideology, framing it as a defense of conservative principles amid broader deconstructions of progressive educational frameworks.

To institutionalize these views, Bolsonaro restructured government ministries in December 2018, abolishing the standalone Human Rights Ministry and creating the Ministry of Women, Family, and Human Rights under evangelical pastor Damares Alves, who prioritized family values while critiquing elements of LGBTQ+ advocacy despite defending legal gay marriage. This move consolidated oversight of women, family, indigenous rights, and human rights into a single entity aligned with pro-family conservatism, reflecting his electoral appeal to religious and traditionalist bases that propelled his 2018 victory.

### Views on Military Dictatorship and National Security

Bolsonaro has consistently expressed admiration for the 1964-1985 military regime, portraying it as a necessary response to perceived communist threats rather than a traditional dictatorship. In March 2019, shortly after assuming the presidency, he directed the Ministry of Defense to organize commemorations for the March 31, 1964, events, framing them as a "movement" that preserved national stability against leftist subversion.  He has argued that the regime averted a communist takeover akin to those in neighboring countries, emphasizing its role in maintaining order amid guerrilla activities and economic challenges under prior civilian governments.  Bolsonaro rejects the label of "coup" for 1964, asserting it represented institutional legitimacy backed by broad societal support, including from the United States, to counter institutional breakdown.

Regarding the regime's repressive measures, Bolsonaro has downplayed human rights abuses, defending figures associated with interrogation practices. In a 2008 confrontation, he stated that the dictatorship's error was "to torture and not to kill," implying a preference for more decisive elimination of threats. He has praised Colonel Carlos Alberto Brilhante Ustra, a regime intelligence officer linked to torture centers, calling him a hero in a 2016 congressional speech and during his 2018 campaign. These positions align with his broader narrative that the military's actions, while firm, were proportionate to combat armed subversion, which involved over 400 deaths from guerrilla violence between 1967 and 1969 alone, though regime-perpetrated killings and disappearances numbered around 434 officially acknowledged cases.

On national security, Bolsonaro advocates a robust military presence as essential for sovereignty and internal stability, drawing from his 17-year army career ending as a captain in 1988. He integrated military personnel extensively into his administration, appointing over 6,000 officers to civilian posts by 2022, including key cabinet roles like Defense Minister, to enhance governance efficiency against corruption and crime.  This militarization extended to security operations, such as deploying troops for Amazon fire control in 2019 and advocating military-led anti-crime interventions in high-violence areas. Bolsonaro views the armed forces as a non-partisan guardian against ideological threats, including socialism, and has pushed for increased defense budgets—rising from 1.3% of GDP in 2018 to proposed expansions—and relaxed firearm ownership to empower civilians in self-defense, complementing military deterrence. His approach prioritizes hierarchical discipline and anti-communist vigilance, reflecting a belief that civilian oversight alone insufficiently addresses Brazil's persistent challenges like organized crime, which claimed over 50,000 lives annually pre-presidency.

### Stance on Democracy, Elections, and Political Violence

Bolsonaro has consistently affirmed support for democratic governance while expressing reservations about its institutional safeguards in Brazil, often citing historical precedents like the 1964 military overthrow of President João Goulart, which he has described as a necessary "revolution" rather than a coup to combat perceived communist threats. In multiple public statements, including during his 2018 presidential campaign, he suggested that military intervention could be justified to preserve national sovereignty against electoral irregularities or institutional overreach, stating in 2018 that "the army is there to guarantee the vote" and implying readiness to invoke Article 142 of the Brazilian Constitution for such purposes, though he clarified this as a defensive measure rather than an offensive power grab. These views reflect a conditional endorsement of democracy, prioritizing order and anti-corruption over strict adherence to civilian supremacy when he perceived systemic threats from left-leaning institutions.

Regarding elections, Bolsonaro repeatedly voiced distrust in Brazil's electronic voting system, the urnas eletrônicas, claiming vulnerabilities to fraud without presenting verifiable evidence, a skepticism he amplified throughout his presidency and intensified ahead of the October 30, 2022, runoff where he lost to Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva by 1.8 percentage points (50.9% to 49.1%).  He urged the military to audit the process and, post-election, continued to question results via social media and allies, though he initially conceded on November 1, 2022, stating "we will comply with the law" while reserving the right to pursue legal challenges. Independent audits by the Superior Electoral Court (TSE) and international observers, including the Organization of American States, confirmed the vote's integrity, with no widespread irregularities found despite Bolsonaro's assertions of hacking risks. In June 2023, the TSE barred him from office until 2030 for abusing power and disseminating election disinformation, a decision upheld amid investigations into his role in eroding public confidence.

On political violence, Bolsonaro has advocated robust state responses to crime and disorder, including arming civilians and deploying the military domestically, as outlined in his 2019 decree easing firearm access for self-defense, which he framed as empowering law-abiding citizens against escalating urban violence (Brazil recorded over 41,000 homicides in 2020). He has condemned specific acts of unrest, such as the January 8, 2023, invasion of Brasília's government buildings by his supporters protesting the election outcome, tweeting that day that "peaceful demonstrations, yes; invasions and vandalism, no" and attributing the events to infiltrators rather than his base. Nonetheless, federal police probes and Supreme Court inquiries have scrutinized his prior rhetoric— including calls for military loyalty and hints at post-election upheaval—as contributing factors, leading to his 2025 conviction alongside aides for plotting to subvert the 2022 results via a potential decree for intervention, though Bolsonaro maintains these were hypothetical discussions to ensure electoral fairness.  Critics, often from outlets with documented institutional biases favoring progressive narratives, link his discourse to heightened polarization, yet empirical data shows no direct orchestration of violence by him, with the TSE noting over 200 disinformation probes during his term but limited convictions for incitement.

### Foreign Policy Priorities

Bolsonaro's foreign policy prioritized alignment with conservative, pro-market governments, emphasizing national sovereignty and a rejection of what he termed "globalist ideologies" that he believed undermined Brazilian interests. In his January 1, 2019, inauguration speech, he pledged to reposition Brazil's international stance to defend sovereignty and prioritize economic partnerships free from ideological impositions. This approach marked a departure from previous administrations' emphasis on South-South cooperation, favoring instead ties with the United States and Israel while adopting a confrontational posture toward leftist regimes in Latin America.

A cornerstone was bolstering relations with the United States under President Donald Trump, including mutual visa exemptions for tourists announced during Bolsonaro's March 2019 Washington visit and coordinated efforts on regional security. The two leaders met multiple times, such as at the March 19, 2019, White House summit, where they discussed broadening bilateral trade and countering transnational threats. Similarly, Bolsonaro deepened ties with Israel, opening a trade office in Jerusalem in 2019 as a step toward enhanced economic and defense cooperation, reflecting his administration's pro-Israel orientation amid evangelical support domestically.

Regionally, Bolsonaro adopted a hardline stance against Venezuela's Nicolás Maduro, declaring on January 18, 2019, his intent to support democracy's restoration there, including potential military aid, and aligning with U.S. efforts to isolate the regime. This reflected a broader priority to counter socialist influences, targeting governments he viewed as threats to regional stability. On trade, despite environmental criticisms from Europe, his administration advanced the EU-Mercosur agreement, finalized in principle on June 28, 2019, which Bolsonaro hailed as historic for opening markets to Brazilian agriculture and industry.

Relations with China presented a pragmatic counterpoint; while Bolsonaro campaigned in 2018 portraying Beijing as an economic predator dominating Brazilian sectors, his government maintained robust trade ties, with China remaining Brazil's top partner, leading to moderated rhetoric post-election to avoid disrupting exports like soybeans and iron ore. This balancing act underscored economic realism amid ideological preferences, as bilateral trade volumes necessitated continuity despite initial criticisms. Overall, Bolsonaro's priorities aimed at transactional diplomacy favoring Brazil's agribusiness and resource sectors, though they strained multilateral engagements like climate accords.

## Personal Life

### Family and Relationships

Jair Bolsonaro was born on March 21, 1955, to Percy Geraldo Bolsonaro, a dentist, and Olinda Bonturi Bolsonaro, in a family of six children including three sons and three daughters.

Bolsonaro's first marriage was to Rogéria Nantes Braga in 1978, with whom he had three sons: Flávio (born 1981), Carlos (born 1985), and Eduardo (born 1984); the couple divorced in 1997. Rogéria later entered politics, winning election as a Rio de Janeiro city councillor shortly after the divorce. His second marriage, to Ana Cristina Valle from 1997 to 2008, produced one son, Jair Renan (born 1999).

In 2007, Bolsonaro married Michelle de Paula Firmo Reinaldo, his third wife, in a civil ceremony; the couple has one daughter, Laura, born in 2010. Michelle, who has a daughter from a prior relationship, has been involved in evangelical activities and supported Bolsonaro's political career, particularly through connections in Brazil's evangelical community.

Several of Bolsonaro's children have pursued political careers, often aligned with their father's conservative positions: Flávio serves as a federal senator, Eduardo as a federal deputy, and Carlos as a Rio de Janeiro city councillor, forming a politically influential family network. Jair Renan has faced investigations related to financial irregularities, though he has denied wrongdoing.

### Health and Personal Habits

On September 6, 2018, Jair Bolsonaro was stabbed in the abdomen during a campaign rally in Juiz de Fora, Minas Gerais, sustaining severe intestinal damage and internal bleeding that necessitated immediate emergency surgery and a temporary colostomy. The attack led to multiple subsequent procedures, including the removal of the colostomy bag on January 28, 2019. In July 2021, he was hospitalized for an intestinal obstruction, a complication stemming from the 2018 injury, which raised the possibility of further emergency surgery.

Bolsonaro tested positive for COVID-19 on July 7, 2020, after experiencing symptoms including fever and fatigue; he reported mild effects and recovered without hospitalization. Post-presidency, he underwent additional surgeries related to lingering intestinal complications from the stabbing, including one in April 2025 for bowel obstruction, after which his health reportedly worsened, requiring ongoing parenteral nutrition, physical therapy, and thrombosis prevention.

Regarding personal habits, Bolsonaro has no documented history of smoking or excessive alcohol consumption, aligning with his disciplined military background. He has publicly advised reducing food intake to manage bowel frequency, reflecting a practical approach to diet. Known preferences include condensed milk and frequent visits to steak and hamburger restaurants during his presidency. Despite limited details on a formal exercise routine, his military service and receipt of an honorary Brazilian jiu-jitsu black belt in 2018 underscore an emphasis on physical fitness, though he has not regularly practiced the discipline.

## Electoral History and Legacy

### Presidential Elections

Bolsonaro entered the 2018 presidential race as a federal deputy with limited national prominence, capitalizing on widespread disillusionment with Brazil's political establishment following the Operation Car Wash investigations that exposed corruption scandals involving the Workers' Party (PT) and other parties. His campaign emphasized anti-corruption measures, economic liberalization, law-and-order policies, and opposition to what he described as leftist cultural influences, resonating with voters frustrated by economic stagnation and rising crime rates under previous PT administrations. On September 6, 2018, during a campaign rally in Juiz de Fora, Minas Gerais, Bolsonaro was stabbed in the abdomen by Adélio Bispo de Oliveira, sustaining serious injuries that required multiple surgeries and hospitalization, an event that generated significant media attention and sympathy, boosting his poll numbers.

In the first round on October 7, 2018, Bolsonaro secured 46.03% of the valid votes (49,276,990 votes), advancing to a runoff against PT candidate Fernando Haddad, who received 29.28% (31,342,051 votes), amid a fragmented field of 13 candidates. The runoff on October 28, 2018, resulted in Bolsonaro's victory with 55.13% (57,797,847 votes) against Haddad's 44.87% (47,035,849 votes), certified by the Superior Electoral Court (TSE), marking the first time a candidate from the Social Liberal Party won the presidency and reflecting a shift toward conservative governance. Voter turnout was approximately 79.7% in the first round, with Bolsonaro dominating in most regions except the Northeast, where Haddad prevailed.

| Candidate | Party Coalition | First Round Votes (%) | Runoff Votes (%) |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------------------|------------------|
| Jair Bolsonaro | PSL/PRTB | 49,276,990 (46.03%) | 57,797,847 (55.13%) |
| Fernando Haddad | PT/PCdoB/PROS | 31,342,051 (29.28%) | 47,035,849 (44.87%) |

As the incumbent in the 2022 election, Bolsonaro campaigned on his administration's economic achievements, including a 2.9% GDP growth in 2021 and reduction in extreme poverty through emergency aid programs, while criticizing Lula da Silva's past PT governments for corruption and economic mismanagement. Key issues included inflation control, agricultural exports, and opposition to environmental regulations perceived as hindering development, alongside defenses of family values and criticism of "globalist" influences. Controversies arose from Bolsonaro's repeated public questioning of electronic voting machine integrity without providing evidence of systemic flaws, prompting TSE warnings and investigations, though audits and international observers confirmed the process's reliability.

In the first round on October 2, 2022, Bolsonaro obtained 43.20% (51,071,850 votes), trailing Lula's 48.43% (57,259,504 votes) but forcing a runoff due to no majority. The October 30 runoff saw Lula win with 50.90% (60,345,999 votes) to Bolsonaro's 49.10% (58,206,354 votes), a margin of about 2 million votes, with Lula strong in urban centers and the Northeast, while Bolsonaro held rural and Southern strongholds. Bolsonaro initially challenged the results citing alleged irregularities in older voting machines, but the TSE rejected the claims, finding no discrepancies warranting annulment, and he did not formally concede while transitioning power occurred. Voter turnout exceeded 78%, reflecting high polarization.

| Candidate | Party Coalition | First Round Votes (%) | Runoff Votes (%) |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------------------|------------------|
| Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva | PT/PCdoB/PV | 57,259,504 (48.43%) | 60,345,999 (50.90%) |
| Jair Bolsonaro | PL/PP | 51,071,850 (43.20%) | 58,206,354 (49.10%)

### Legislative Elections

Bolsonaro entered politics through legislative elections at the municipal level, securing a seat on the Rio de Janeiro city council in the November 15, 1988, municipal elections as a candidate for the Christian Democratic Party (PDC). He assumed office in 1989 and served until resigning in 1990 to pursue a federal position.

Transitioning to national politics, Bolsonaro was elected as a federal deputy for Rio de Janeiro in the 1990 general elections, receiving 17,674 votes for the PDC and ranking among the elected candidates. He was reelected in every subsequent general election from 1994 through 2014, securing seven consecutive terms in the Chamber of Deputies from February 1991 to January 2019. His vote totals grew substantially over time, reflecting increasing support amid Brazil's political shifts toward anti-corruption and conservative sentiments; by the 2014 election, he obtained 464,572 votes—the highest for any federal deputy candidate in Rio de Janeiro that cycle—while running for the Progressive Party (PP).

During his federal tenure, Bolsonaro switched parties multiple times, moving from PDC to the Progressive Party of Brazil (PPB) in 1995, the Liberal Front Party (PFL, later Democrats) in 2003, and PP in 2016, amid a fragmented Brazilian party system. His electoral success relied on a loyal base in military circles, evangelical communities, and voters frustrated with traditional politics, rather than broad legislative output, as he introduced few bills that advanced but maintained visibility through media and public stances on security and family issues. In the 2018 election, he did not seek reelection to Congress, instead winning the presidency.

### Overall Political Impact and Evaluations

Bolsonaro's presidency from 2019 to 2023 marked a shift toward economic liberalization, with Finance Minister Paulo Guedes implementing pension reforms and privatization efforts that aimed to reduce fiscal deficits and attract investment, though real GDP growth remained modest at around 1% in 2019 before the COVID-19 downturn. Unemployment declined from 13.5% in 2020 to 8.1% by late 2022, driven by post-pandemic recovery and labor market flexibility measures, while inflation peaked at 10% in 2021 amid global supply shocks and domestic spending. Supporters, including business sectors, praised these policies for fostering investor confidence and averting deeper recession, attributing causality to deregulation that encouraged job creation despite external pressures.

On public security, intentional homicide rates fell markedly during Bolsonaro's term, continuing a pre-existing downward trend but accelerating to record lows by 2022, with a 19.2% reduction from prior levels linked by proponents to expanded police autonomy, anti-crime operations, and eased firearm access for self-defense. Critics in academic and media outlets, often aligned with left-leaning institutions, contested direct causation, pointing to state-level initiatives predating his administration and warning of heightened police lethality. Conversely, environmental policies under Bolsonaro prioritized agribusiness expansion, resulting in a 75.5% surge in average annual Amazon deforestation compared to the prior decade, with 45,586 km² lost over four years—reaching 15-year highs in 2021—due to weakened enforcement against illegal logging and land grabs.

The COVID-19 response drew sharp evaluations, with Brazil recording nearly 700,000 deaths by 2023—the second-highest globally—amid Bolsonaro's public skepticism of lockdowns, masks, and vaccines, which epidemiological analyses linked to elevated mortality in pro-Bolsonaro municipalities and an estimated 400,000 preventable fatalities from delayed national coordination. Detractors, including human rights groups, attributed excess deaths to institutional denialism that eroded trust in health authorities, while defenders argued high urbanization and pre-existing inequalities, not solely policy, drove outcomes comparable to other large developing nations. Politically, Bolsonaro polarized Brazil, consolidating a conservative base through anti-corruption rhetoric and military ties but eroding institutional norms, culminating in the January 8, 2023, riots by supporters storming government buildings after his 2022 electoral defeat—events tied to his unsubstantiated fraud claims and later deemed a coup attempt by Brazil's Supreme Court. Approval ratings fluctuated, dipping below 20% in 2021 amid scandals before recovering to around 30-40% by term's end, with post-presidency surveys showing 40% favorable views amid ongoing influence on the right-wing opposition. His legacy endures as a catalyst for rightward realignment, empowering evangelical and rural voters against perceived elite dominance, though marred by deepened societal divides and scrutiny over democratic backsliding from sources with institutional biases toward progressive narratives.
