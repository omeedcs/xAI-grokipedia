  "content": "# Samuel L. Jackson\n\nSamuel Leroy Jackson (born December 21, 1948) is an American actor and producer recognized for his distinctive voice, intense screen presence, and prolific output in over 100 films spanning action, drama, and blockbuster franchises. Born in Washington, D.C., and raised in Chattanooga, Tennessee, Jackson overcame early struggles with addiction to achieve breakthrough success in the 1990s, particularly with his Academy Award-nominated portrayal of Jules Winnfield in Quentin Tarantino's *Pulp Fiction* (1994), where he delivered the film's iconic Ezekiel 25:17 monologue. His subsequent roles, including Nick Fury in the Marvel Cinematic Universe starting with *The Avengers* (2012), propelled him to become the highest-grossing live-action actor, with his films accumulating over $27 billion in worldwide box office earnings. Jackson's career also features memorable performances in *Jurassic Park* (1993), *Django Unchained* (2012), and *The Hateful Eight* (2015), earning him multiple accolades such as a BAFTA Award and cementing his status as a versatile character actor. Despite his commercial dominance, Jackson has faced scrutiny for his unfiltered political commentary and defense of provocative language in Tarantino collaborations, reflecting his roots in civil rights activism and commitment to authentic representation.\n\n## Early life\n\n### Childhood and family\n\nSamuel Leroy Jackson was born on December 21, 1948, in Washington, D.C., to Elizabeth Montgomery Jackson, a factory worker, and Roy Henry Jackson. His parents separated shortly after his birth, with his father abandoning the family and relocating to Kansas City, Missouri, where he maintained minimal contact, meeting Jackson only twice in his lifetime before dying from alcoholism.\n\nJackson was raised primarily in Chattanooga, Tennessee, by his maternal grandparents and aunt in a segregated Southern Black community, after his mother relocated him there as an infant while she continued working in Washington, D.C. His grandmother enforced strict discipline, including early reading lessons from his aunt, fostering a Protestant household routine of daily prayers amid limited exposure to mainstream media in the Jim Crow-era South.\n\nAs a child, Jackson struggled with a stutter that persisted into his school years, which he overcame through deliberate practice reciting Bible verses aloud and participating in public speaking, habits that built his verbal confidence despite initial family concerns about the impediment. His early environment emphasized self-reliance and community ties within Chattanooga's Black neighborhoods, shaping his formative experiences before his mother's periodic returns and eventual relocation plans influenced his later moves.\n\n### Education and civil rights activism\n\nJackson attended Morehouse College in Atlanta, Georgia, enrolling in the late 1960s with an initial intent to major in marine biology before shifting focus to drama through involvement in campus theater productions and public speaking classes aimed at overcoming his childhood stutter. He re-enrolled as a drama major in January 1971 following a period of expulsion and absence, ultimately graduating in 1972.\n\nThe assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968 spurred Jackson's engagement with the Black Power movement, drawing him into more militant forms of activism amid widespread campus unrest over racial inequities in education and governance. In spring 1969, Jackson joined fellow members of the Concerned Students group in an armed takeover of Harkness Hall, locking the board of trustees—including Martin Luther King Sr.—inside for a 29-hour standoff to demand establishment of a Black studies program, enhanced community engagement by the college, majority representation of people of color on the board, and merger into a proposed Martin Luther King University.\n\nDuring the occupation, protesters chained the building's doors, scrawled slogans such as \"M.L. King University Now\" on its exterior, and supplied food to the captives, though no shots were fired; Martin Luther King Sr. was permitted to exit via a ladder-assisted window after complaining of chest pains, averting potential accusations of responsibility for his death. Although initial negotiations yielded promises of amnesty and some reforms, Jackson faced expulsion shortly thereafter from an advisory committee citing his participation in the unlawful confinement.\n\nPost-expulsion, Jackson deepened ties to radical organizations like the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), associating with Black Power leaders such as Stokely Carmichael and contemplating procurement of firearms for further actions, but his mother—alerted by FBI warnings of impending violence—intervened, compelling him to relocate temporarily to Los Angeles for social services work. This disruption, set against the era's escalating tensions between student radicals and institutional authorities, prompted Jackson's eventual return to Morehouse and pivot toward drama as a career path, distancing him from sustained militant organizing.\n\n## Career\n\n### Early theater and film roles (1970s–1980s)\n\nAfter graduating from Morehouse College in 1972, Jackson toured with the Atlanta-based Black Image Theatre company before relocating to New York City in 1976 to pursue acting opportunities. There, he immersed himself in the off-Broadway theater scene, securing roles with the Negro Ensemble Company (NEC), a prominent troupe founded in 1967 to promote Black theater artists. His early stage work included appearances in Samm-Art Williams's *Home* (1979 NEC production) and Charles Fuller's Pulitzer Prize-winning *A Soldier's Play* (1981 NEC premiere, alongside Denzel Washington).  Jackson also originated the role of Boy Willie in August Wilson's *The Piano Lesson* during its 1987 world premiere at Yale Repertory Theatre, later transferring off-Broadway.\n\nThese theater engagements provided steady but low-paying work amid financial instability, as Jackson supplemented income with odd jobs while navigating the competitive New York acting landscape. His professional stage debut came in 1980 with Bertolt Brecht's *Mother Courage and Her Children* at The Public Theatre, marking an entry into more established venues. However, this period coincided with escalating personal challenges, including heavy substance abuse that began intensifying after his move to New York; by the late 1970s and into the 1980s, Jackson's dependency on cocaine and heroin disrupted rehearsals and reliability, leading to interventions by family members. \n\nTransitioning to screen work, Jackson landed minor film roles, debuting as Gang Member No. 2 in Milos Forman's *Ragtime* (1981), a period drama adapted from E.L. Doctorow's novel. He later appeared briefly as a robber in Eddie Murphy's comedy *Coming to America* (1988), one of his few credited parts amid sparse opportunities. On television, Jackson served as a stand-in for Bill Cosby on *The Cosby Show* for approximately two to three years during its early run (1984–1987), performing blocking and camera tests in Cosby's wardrobe while pursuing his own auditions. These peripheral gigs underscored his persistence in an industry where visibility remained limited, compounded by addiction's toll on professional consistency.\n\n### Breakthrough in the 1990s\n\nIn 1990, Jackson confronted his long-standing cocaine and heroin addiction, quitting cold turkey after his wife, LaTanya Richardson, discovered him unconscious following a day of heavy use and urged him to seek change, enabling renewed professional focus amid prior sporadic roles. This sobriety facilitated his preparation for demanding parts, culminating in his defining portrayal of Jules Winnfield, a philosophical hitman, in Quentin Tarantino's *Pulp Fiction* (1994), where his commanding delivery of Ezekiel 25:17 propelled the character's intensity and earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor.\n\nThe film's critical and commercial success, grossing over $200 million worldwide on a $8 million budget, marked Jackson's ascent to leading-man status, shifting him from supporting ensemble parts to action-thriller protagonists. In *Die Hard with a Vengeance* (1995), he played Zeus Carver, a street-smart everyman aiding detective John McClane against a terrorist plot, contributing to the film's $366 million global box office haul and demonstrating his chemistry in high-stakes buddy dynamics.\n\nJackson further solidified this transition in *Jackie Brown* (1997), Tarantino's follow-up, as Ordell Robbie, a slick yet volatile arms dealer manipulating a money-smuggling scheme, showcasing nuanced menace that highlighted his range beyond pure action. By *The Negotiator* (1998), he led as Lieutenant Danny Roman, a framed Chicago hostage expert who barricades himself to expose corruption, blending procedural tension with personal stakes in a role that underscored his draw as a reliable thriller anchor. These performances, rooted in raw intensity rather than typecasting, empirically elevated his marketability through consistent audience draw and critical notice for authenticity over formula.\n\n### Established leading roles (2000s)\n\nIn 2000, Jackson starred as the titular detective John Shaft in the action thriller remake directed by John Singleton, portraying a no-nonsense New York City police officer pursuing justice against a wealthy criminal's son. The film received mixed reviews, with Roger Ebert noting Jackson's ability to infuse the role with conviction despite narrative shortcomings, while it achieved a 67% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 115 reviews. That same year, he delivered a critically nuanced performance as Elijah Price, a comic book art dealer with brittle bone disease who uncovers a potential real-life superhero, in M. Night Shyamalan's *Unbreakable*. The film grossed $95 million domestically against a $75 million budget and held a 70% Rotten Tomatoes score from 172 reviews, highlighting Jackson's range in psychologically layered antagonist roles.\n\nJackson's versatility extended into dramatic territory with *Changing Lanes* (2002), where he played Doyle Gipson, a struggling insurance salesman and recovering alcoholic entangled in a escalating feud with a privileged lawyer after a car accident. The thriller earned strong critical acclaim, including a rare four-star review from Roger Ebert for its exploration of moral escalation and Jackson's modulated intensity, alongside a 77% Rotten Tomatoes rating from 151 reviews, and it grossed $66 million worldwide. Building on his *Star Wars* debut, Jackson reprised the role of Jedi Master Mace Windu in *Episode II: Attack of the Clones* (2002) and *Episode III: Revenge of the Sith* (2005), contributing to the prequel trilogy's depiction of the Jedi Council's internal conflicts and battles against emerging Sith threats.\n\nThroughout the decade, Jackson maintained a steady output of leading roles across action, thriller, and science fiction genres, navigating post-9/11 industry contractions in theatrical releases and a shift toward safer blockbusters by leveraging his established draw from the 1990s. His performances underscored a command of authoritative, multifaceted characters, from street-smart investigators to intellectual manipulators, without reliance on typecasting. This period affirmed his status as a bankable lead capable of anchoring mid-budget films with commercial viability and selective critical praise.\n\n### Franchise dominance and versatility (2010s)\n\nJackson's portrayal of Nick Fury in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) defined his franchise dominance during the 2010s, building on a nine-picture deal signed prior to *Iron Man* (2008) that ensured his recurring presence across interconnected blockbusters. He appeared as the strategic S.H.I.E.L.D. director in key 2010s entries including *Iron Man 2* (2010), *Thor* (2011), *Captain America: The First Avenger* (2011), *The Avengers* (2012), *Captain America: The Winter Soldier* (2014), *Avengers: Age of Ultron* (2015), *Avengers: Infinity War* (2018), *Captain Marvel* (2019), and *Avengers: Endgame* (2019), roles that spanned over a decade and anchored the MCU's narrative continuity. These films collectively grossed tens of billions worldwide, with Jackson's authoritative, no-nonsense depiction of Fury providing causal stability to ensemble-driven plots amid escalating stakes, from assembling the Avengers to confronting cosmic threats.\n\nBeyond the MCU, Jackson expanded into other action-oriented franchises, demonstrating versatility through antagonistic and comedic roles that leveraged his commanding screen presence. In *Kingsman: The Secret Service* (2014), he played the lisping tech billionaire villain Richmond Valentine, whose eco-terrorist scheme drove the film's satirical spy thriller elements and contributed to its $414 million global box office. He headlined the buddy action comedy *The Hitman's Bodyguard* (2017) as the foul-mouthed assassin Darius Kincaid, a performance that paired his improvisational energy with Ryan Reynolds and propelled the film to $176 million in earnings, establishing a sequel template through their banter-fueled dynamic. In voice work, Jackson reprised Lucius Best/Frozone in Pixar's *Incredibles 2* (2018), infusing the superhero sidekick with wry humor and loyalty, aiding the animated sequel's record $1.24 billion haul as the highest-grossing animated film at the time.\n\nJackson balanced these franchise commitments with standalone yet franchise-adjacent projects, maintaining visibility in genre spectacles. His role as the vengeful U.S. Army Lt. Col. Preston Packard in *Kong: Skull Island* (2017)—part of Legendary's MonsterVerse—embodied rigid military pragmatism clashing with prehistoric chaos, grossing $566 million worldwide and highlighting his ability to anchor ensemble adventures outside superhero universes. This mix of recurring franchise anchors and varied character types underscored Jackson's economic value: his involvement correlated with films averaging over $500 million in global receipts during the decade, driven by his reliable draw in high-stakes action and voice modulation across live-action and animation. Such contractual foresight and range mitigated typecasting risks, allowing him to influence box office longevity through pivotal, often paternalistic figures in ensemble narratives.\n\n### Recent projects and television ventures (2020–present)\n\nIn 2021, Jackson appeared in the action thriller *The Protégé*, directed by Martin Campbell, playing the role of Moody, a former intelligence operative mentoring assassin Anna (Maggie Q). The film, produced by Hammerstone Studios and released theatrically on August 20, 2021, by Lionsgate, received mixed reviews for its plot but praise for its fight choreography. Later that year, he co-starred in *The Unforgivable*, a Netflix drama directed by Nora Fingscheidt, as the prison counselor to Sandra Bullock's character Ruth Slater. Released on December 10, 2021, the film focused on themes of redemption and family reconciliation, earning Bullock an Oscar nomination for her performance while Jackson's supporting role was noted for its emotional depth.\n\nJackson expanded into television with the Marvel Cinematic Universe's *Secret Invasion* series on Disney+, premiering June 21, 2023, reprising his role as Nick Fury alongside Don Cheadle's James Rhodes. The six-episode spy thriller, dealing with Skrull shape-shifters infiltrating Earth, marked a significant shift for Jackson toward serialized TV formats, though it faced criticism for pacing and deviations from comic lore. In 2024, he starred in *Damaged*, a crime thriller directed by Terry Kinney, portraying a Chicago detective collaborating with Liam Neeson's Scottish inspector on a serial killer case. Released on April 12, 2024, the film emphasized procedural elements but was critiqued for formulaic scripting.\n\nLooking toward 2025 and beyond, Jackson was cast as the lead in *NOLA King*, a spinoff from Taylor Sheridan's *Tulsa King* series for Paramount+, announced in early 2025, where he plays a New Orleans-based crime boss navigating post-Hurricane Katrina dynamics. Upcoming films include *Afterburn*, an adaptation of the Red 5 comic set for release in 2025, with Jackson alongside Keanu Reeves as survivors in a post-apocalyptic world; *Unholy Trinity*, a heist thriller; and *Man of War*, a shark-infested action project. These projects highlight Jackson's continued pivot to ensemble action and TV, leveraging his franchise experience. Additionally, Jackson made a cameo narration for the Super Bowl LIX halftime show in New Orleans on February 9, 2025, and featured in a 2024 Vattenfall campaign promoting sustainable seaweed energy solutions in Sweden.\n\n## Commercial achievements\n\n### Box office performance\n\nSamuel L. Jackson's films have collectively grossed over $28 billion worldwide as of October 2025, positioning him among the top-grossing actors in history based on aggregate unadjusted box office totals across all roles. This figure encompasses 146 credited appearances, yielding an average worldwide gross of approximately $194 million per film. His prolific output, spanning leading, supporting, and cameo roles, has driven this tally, with significant contributions from ensemble blockbusters rather than solo lead vehicles.\n\nThe bulk of Jackson's box office impact stems from his portrayal of Nick Fury in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), appearing in nine films that include the highest-grossing entries such as *Avengers: Endgame* ($2.797 billion worldwide) and *Avengers: Infinity War* ($2.052 billion). These MCU projects alone account for over $10 billion in grosses, highlighting franchise reliance as a key factor in his totals; he is the only actor to appear in ten films each surpassing $1 billion globally. In comparison to peers like Robert Downey Jr., whose earnings are more concentrated in lead MCU roles across fewer films, Jackson's metrics reflect broader participation in high-earning ensembles, elevating his cumulative figures despite variable per-film prominence.\n\nBeyond franchises, Jackson's star power has boosted non-MCU projects, with supporting roles in films like *Jurassic Park* ($1.058 billion) and *Pulp Fiction* contributing to peaks outside superhero genres. His average holding power in mid-tier releases demonstrates causal draw, as evidenced by consistent outperformance relative to ensemble casts in similar budgeted productions, though precise attribution remains challenging without isolating variables like marketing and co-stars. Overall, these metrics underscore a career model of volume and versatility over singular lead dominance.\n\n### Highest-grossing actor status\n\nSamuel L. Jackson is recognized as the highest-grossing actor in history based on worldwide box office totals for films in which he has appeared, exceeding $27 billion unadjusted as of 2025. This metric, compiled by box office data aggregators like The Numbers, attributes earnings to actors regardless of billing prominence, encompassing over 100 credits spanning lead, supporting, and cameo roles. Guinness World Records has affirmed related benchmarks, such as Jackson starring in 45 films grossing over $100 million each, underscoring his consistent participation in commercial successes since the record's establishment around 2011.\n\nThe accumulation persists into the 2020s, even amid reduced output from major franchises like the Marvel Cinematic Universe following its phase-four transition, due to the compounding effect of prior high-earners and selective ongoing projects. Causal drivers include strategic multi-picture commitments, such as those enabling repeated appearances across interconnected film series, which amplify per-actor totals through shared universe economics rather than isolated star vehicles. Genre adaptability—spanning action, drama, and sci-fi—paired with enduring director collaborations, like those with Quentin Tarantino, has facilitated access to varied high-budget productions, prioritizing output volume over singular blockbusters.\n\nThis status reflects longevity and deliberate positioning over serendipity, with Jackson's five-decade career yielding sustained employment in revenue-generating roles amid industry volatility, contrasting narratives of fortuitous timing. Adjustments for inflation are rare in actor rankings, as nominal figures dominate empirical tracking, though they would marginally temper modern franchise dominance relative to pre-1980s epics. Role-scale considerations—where supporting parts in ensemble hits contribute fully—can inflate attributions compared to lead-centric metrics, yet standard methodologies uphold Jackson's lead, with no peer surpassing his aggregate through equivalent breadth.\n\n## Other professional endeavors\n\n### Voice acting and narration\n\nJackson provided the voice for Lucius Best / Frozone in Pixar's *The Incredibles* (2004) and its sequel *Incredibles 2* (2018), portraying the ice-powered superhero as a loyal friend with a distinctive blend of cool demeanor and familial frustration. His delivery emphasized Frozone's pragmatic humor and relational dynamics, contributing to the character's memorability in audience feedback, with *The Incredibles* holding an 8.0 IMDb user rating from over 700,000 votes.\n\nIn the anime series *Afro Samurai* (2007), Jackson dual-voiced the titular stoic swordsman Afro and the wisecracking alter-ego Ninja-Ninja, infusing the English dub with his signature cadence that contrasted Afro's minimalism against Ninja-Ninja's verbosity. The series received a 7.6 IMDb rating from nearly 20,000 users, with Jackson's performance highlighted for enhancing the narrative's revenge-driven intensity and comic relief. He reprised Afro in the 2009 video game adaptation, maintaining continuity in vocal style across media.\n\nJackson narrated the documentary *I Am Not Your Negro* (2016), adapting James Baldwin's unfinished manuscript *Remember This House* to explore civil rights history through Baldwin's lens on race in America. The film's 7.9 IMDb rating from over 30,000 users reflected approval for his measured, authoritative narration that amplified Baldwin's incisive prose without overshadowing it. Similarly, in the 2020 miniseries *Enslaved*, he guided explorations of the transatlantic slave trade's remnants, recruiting explorers to trace forgotten routes, earning a 6.4 IMDb score amid praise for his engaging, urgent delivery in historical recounting.\n\nHis narration extended to commercials, including voice-over for political ads like \"Americans for a Better Tomorrow\" (2011) and product campaigns such as adidas Originals' Superstar tribute (2025), leveraging his resonant timbre for persuasive emphasis. These efforts demonstrated his voice's versatility in non-fictional and promotional contexts, broadening his reach to audiences valuing auditory impact over visual presence.\n\n### Audiobooks and endorsements\n\nJackson has narrated numerous audiobooks, leveraging his distinctive voice for titles such as *A Rage in Harlem* (2012) by Chester Himes and *Nelson Mandela's Favorite African Folktales* (2002). His narration of *A Rage in Harlem* earned a nomination for an Audie Award in the Classics category in 2013. Additionally, his performance in the full-cast production of *Nelson Mandela's Favorite African Folktales*, featuring contributors like Whoopi Goldberg, contributed to its recognition in the 2003 Audie Awards for Audiobook of the Year.\n\nThese audiobook projects represent a diversification of Jackson's voice work beyond film, providing steady ancillary revenue through platforms like Audible, where his catalog includes adaptations of literary classics and contemporary works. As Jackson has advanced into his late 70s, such narration roles offer lower-physical-demand opportunities to maintain commercial visibility and income streams independent of on-screen acting.\n\nIn endorsements, Jackson has maintained a long-standing partnership with Capital One, starring in over 170 nationally aired TV commercials for the brand's credit cards, including recent 2025 spots like the Savor Card \"Movie Night\" and business-focused ads featuring the Spark Cash Plus card. This collaboration underscores his appeal in financial services marketing, emphasizing rewards and everyday utility. In July 2025, he featured in Vattenfall's \"Wind Farmed Seaweed Snacks\" campaign, promoting sustainable offshore wind energy by highlighting seaweed cultivation at wind farms as a byproduct for food production, with ads distributed across Vattenfall's European markets. Jackson also narrated Adidas Originals' 2025 Superstar sneaker campaign, \"The Original,\" celebrating the silhouette's cultural legacy alongside figures like Missy Elliott. These endorsements extend his brand into consumer goods and sustainability initiatives, generating revenue amid selective film commitments.\n\n## Personal life\n\n### Marriage and family\n\nSamuel L. Jackson has been married to actress LaTanya Richardson Jackson since August 18, 1980. The couple met as college students in Atlanta, with Jackson attending the all-male Morehouse College and Richardson studying at the affiliated Spelman College; they began dating in 1970 while participating in joint theater productions.\n\nJackson and Richardson have one daughter, Zoe Jackson, born March 28, 1982. The family has prioritized privacy amid Jackson's high-profile career, rarely appearing together in public or media.\n\nRichardson Jackson has built a career centered on theater, including Broadway productions such as *To Kill a Mockingbird* (2018) and *Purpose* (2025), alongside film and television roles. She has received civic awards for community involvement, including from the Atlanta Urban League Guild.\n\nThe stability of Jackson's marriage provided key support during his addiction recovery in 1991, when Richardson confronted him after discovering his drug use around their then-8-year-old daughter, leading him to enter rehabilitation and maintain sobriety thereafter.\n\n### Addiction recovery and health challenges\n\nJackson developed a severe addiction to cocaine and heroin during the 1980s, beginning with recreational use as a teenager and escalating after moving to New York in the late 1970s, which strained his marriage and family ties. In 1990, his wife LaTanya Richardson staged an intervention upon discovering him unconscious from drug use, prompting him to enter a brief rehabilitation program; he emerged sober and has maintained abstinence from all substances for over three decades without relapse. Jackson has credited his recovery to personal resolve and discipline, noting that even at the height of his addiction, he never missed work obligations or failed to perform, demonstrating functional self-control that facilitated his post-rehab career surge.\n\nAs a child, Jackson contended with a debilitating stutter that led to severe bullying and a year-long period of school silence, which his aunt addressed by arranging speech therapy. He overcame much of the impediment through acting, which forced deliberate speech practice, though it occasionally resurfaces during reading; Jackson manages residual effects by invoking profanity like \"motherfucker,\" which rhythmically aids fluency without formal ongoing therapy.\n\nJackson has no publicly disclosed ongoing personal health issues but has advocated for Alzheimer's awareness due to the disease affecting six family members, including recent involvement in the Alzheimer's Association's 2024 \"Generation Hope\" campaign and a 2025 social media post honoring impacted families.\n\n## Public persona and controversies\n\n### Political views and endorsements\n\nIn his youth during the late 1960s, Jackson associated with the Black Power movement, meeting activists including Stokely Carmichael and H. Rap Brown, but distanced himself after his mother, alerted by FBI contact, intervened to prevent deeper involvement in potential armed confrontations. This marked an evolution from radical activism toward more conventional political expressions aligned with the Democratic Party.\n\nJackson endorsed Barack Obama in the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections, admitting in a 2012 interview that his support stemmed primarily from Obama's race rather than policy specifics. He participated in Obama campaign efforts, including a 2012 ad urging voters to \"wake the f*** up\" and prioritize turnout over complacency. In October 2024, Jackson spoke at a Kamala Harris rally in Atlanta, Georgia, on October 24, stressing that \"our vote is our voice\" and calling for unified participation to counter perceived threats to democratic participation.\n\nJackson has consistently criticized Donald Trump, going viral in 2016 for labeling him a \"motherfucker\" in an interview and later endorsing Representative Rashida Tlaib's 2019 use of the term to describe the former president. In a June 2023 Rolling Stone interview, he equated Trump with the \"rednecks\" from his Chattanooga childhood who directed racial epithets at him, framing such figures as emblematic of persistent prejudice.\n\nOn firearms, Jackson, who carries a concealed weapon for self-defense, has rejected calls for expanded gun control, citing his Southern upbringing amid widespread gun ownership without corresponding violence and arguing that intruders forfeit rights against armed response. He has qualified this by asserting that \"nobody needs a machine gun,\" indicating support for restrictions on automatic weapons while defending personal handgun ownership.\n\nJackson promotes voting as a fundamental right, featuring in a 2020 Biden campaign ad decrying voter suppression tactics and regularly posting on social media—such as on November 5, 2024—to direct citizens to polling resources and emphasize electoral participation.\n\n### Statements on race, language, and culture\n\nSamuel L. Jackson has defended the use of the full racial epithet \"nigger\" in Quentin Tarantino's films, arguing it is essential for historical and artistic authenticity in depicting slavery and racism. In *Django Unchained* (2012), the word appears over 110 times in dialogue, which Jackson justified as necessary to convey the era's brutality without dilution, stating that Tarantino's intent was not racist but reflective of character-driven narratives. He contrasted this with non-artistic contexts, emphasizing that Tarantino's employment of Black actors like himself to deliver the lines underscores a collaborative understanding absent in exploitative uses.\n\nIn a 2022 interview, Jackson critiqued podcaster Joe Rogan's repeated use of the epithet while singing along to rap lyrics on his show, deeming it inappropriate due to the casual, non-performative context lacking narrative purpose or historical grounding. Rogan had issued an apology amid backlash, but Jackson dismissed it as potentially insincere, suggesting Rogan apologize for being \"comfortable\" with the word rather than solely for financial repercussions from sponsors. This distinction highlights Jackson's view that the epithet's acceptability hinges on intent, medium, and cultural reclamation by Black speakers, tied to his own experiences growing up under segregation in Chattanooga, Tennessee, where such language was ubiquitous in daily racism.\n\nDuring a 2013 promotional interview for *Django Unchained*, Jackson insisted on pronouncing the full epithet himself and challenged white interviewer Jake Hamilton to do the same when discussing its film usage, refusing to proceed otherwise to force confrontation with the word's raw power and historical weight. Jackson explained this approach stems from a deliberate strategy to unsettle audiences and interviewers, compelling acknowledgment of racial discomfort rather than euphemistic avoidance like \"the N-word,\" which he sees as evading the term's visceral impact.\n\nOn Black representation in media, Jackson has advocated for cultural specificity, criticizing the casting of Black British actors in roles depicting American racial dynamics, as they lack direct experience with U.S.-specific racism. In 2017, he cited Jordan Peele's *Get Out* and its lead Daniel Kaluuya, arguing such parts should prioritize American Black actors who embody the nuanced \"slave movie\" or post-segregation perspectives he draws from personally, without denying opportunities abroad but prioritizing authenticity in U.S.-centric stories. This stance reflects his broader emphasis on lived racial context over generalized \"Blackness\" in cultural narratives.\n\n### Criticisms and public backlash\n\nIn June 2018, Samuel L. Jackson posted a sarcastic tweet on President Donald Trump's birthday, featuring an image implying a homophobic sexual act involving Trump and Vladimir Putin, which drew widespread criticism for perceived anti-gay slurs. Detractors accused him of homophobia and insensitivity, prompting calls for accountability amid debates over free speech and celebrity rhetoric. Jackson rejected the backlash, framing the post as obvious satire and highlighting that Twitter reviewed but did not penalize his account, underscoring tensions between provocative expression and offense.\n\nJackson has faced accusations of inconsistent standards on racial language in entertainment. In February 2022, he condemned podcaster Joe Rogan's repeated use of the N-word in older episodes as unacceptable for a white comedian, yet simultaneously defended Quentin Tarantino's liberal employment of the term in dialogue, including in films like *Django Unchained* (2012) where Jackson starred and delivered such lines. Observers pointed to this disparity—tolerating the slur in Hollywood collaborations versus public platforms—as evidence of selective indignation influenced by industry alliances rather than uniform principles.\n\nJackson's early activism in the late 1960s, including joining a group that held Morehouse College trustees hostage for two days after Martin Luther King Jr.'s April 4, 1968, assassination to demand black studies programs, invited federal intervention. The FBI contacted his mother with threats of arrest or harm, pressuring her to extract him from Black Power circles and effectively steering him toward acting studies. While Jackson has portrayed this as a formative pivot, some analyses question the long-term efficacy of such disruptive tactics by figures who later thrive in commercial entertainment, viewing them as emblematic of celebrity activism's shift from radical confrontation to aligned institutional critique.\n\n## Awards and recognition\n\n### Major accolades\n\nJackson's portrayal of the drug-addicted Gator Purify in *Jungle Fever* (1991) earned him the Cannes Film Festival's Best Supporting Actor award, a category dormant since 1985 that organizers revived specifically for his performance.\nHis role as Jules Winnfield in *Pulp Fiction* (1994) resulted in an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor in 1995, acknowledging the character's philosophical depth and intensity, though the award went to Martin Landau for *Ed Wood*. For the same performance, Jackson won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role, highlighting his commanding presence in ensemble dynamics.\nIn recognition of his genre contributions, Jackson received multiple Saturn Awards from the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Films, including Best Supporting Actor for Nick Fury in *Captain America: The Winter Soldier* (2014), reflecting peer validation within science fiction and action cinema. He has also secured NAACP Image Awards for supporting performances, such as Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture for roles emphasizing cultural representation.\n\n### Honors and lifetime achievements\n\nJackson received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on June 13, 2000, at 7018 Hollywood Boulevard, acknowledging his rising prominence following breakthrough roles in films like *Pulp Fiction*.\n\nHis career longevity is evidenced by appearances in over 150 films, contributing to a cultural ubiquity marked by versatile portrayals across genres from action thrillers to animated features.\n\nGuinness World Records recognizes Jackson as the actor with the most films exceeding $100 million in worldwide box office earnings (45 as of 2023) and the highest cumulative gross, surpassing $27 billion, reflecting the commercial impact of his consistent output over four decades.\n\nIn 2024, the Museum of Modern Art presented its Film Benefit honoring Jackson on October 23, celebrating his prolific body of work with tributes from peers including Denzel Washington and Spike Lee.\n\n## Filmography\n\nSamuel L. Jackson's film career spans over four decades, encompassing more than 150 credits in film and television, with a focus on supporting and leading roles in action, drama, and franchise projects. His early collaborations with director Spike Lee in films such as *Do the Right Thing* (1989, as Mister Señor Love Daddy) and *Mo' Better Blues* (1990, as Madlock) marked initial breakthroughs in independent cinema. \n\nBreakout prominence arrived with *Pulp Fiction* (1994), where he portrayed Jules Winnfield, earning an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor and establishing his commanding screen presence. Subsequent high-profile roles included Zeus Carver in *Die Hard with a Vengeance* (1995), a box office success grossing over $366 million worldwide, and Ordell Robbie in *Jackie Brown* (1997), for which he received the Silver Bear for Best Actor at the Berlin International Film Festival.\n\nJackson's involvement in major franchises expanded his reach, notably as Ray Arnold in *Jurassic Park* (1993), Mace Windu across the *Star Wars* prequel trilogy (1999–2005), and Lucius Best/Frozone in *The Incredibles* (2004) and its 2018 sequel, both critically acclaimed animated hits. From 2008 onward, he portrayed Nick Fury in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, appearing in over a dozen films including *Iron Man* (2008), *The Avengers* (2012, grossing $1.5 billion globally), and *The Avengers: Age of Ultron* (2015). Other notable performances include Elijah Price in *Unbreakable* (2000), Stephen in *Django Unchained* (2012), and Major Marquis Warren in *The Hateful Eight* (2015).\n\n| Year | Title | Role | Notes |\n|------|--------|------|-------|\n| 1993 | Jurassic Park | Ray Arnold | Blockbuster; part of franchise grossing billions. |\n| 1994 | Pulp Fiction | Jules Winnfield | Oscar-nominated; Palme d'Or winner at Cannes. |\n| 1995 | Die Hard with a Vengeance | Zeus Carver | Action sequel; $366 million worldwide gross. |\n| 1997 | Jackie Brown | Ordell Robbie | Tarantino film; Silver Bear for Best Actor. |\n| 1999–2005 | Star Wars prequels | Mace Windu | Jedi Master in Episodes I–III. |\n| 2000 | Unbreakable | Elijah Price | M.
