## Overview

NVIDIA Corporation is a multinational technology company headquartered in Santa Clara, California, USA. Founded in 1993, NVIDIA is best known for its pioneering work in graphics processing units (GPUs), which are critical components for rendering high-quality graphics in video games, simulations, and professional visualization tools. Over the years, the company has expanded its focus to include artificial intelligence (AI), deep learning, autonomous vehicles, and high-performance computing (HPC). NVIDIA's innovations have positioned it as a leader in the semiconductor industry, with its products and technologies shaping modern computing and digital experiences [NVIDIA Official Website](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/).

## Historical Background

NVIDIA was founded on April 5, 1993, by Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky, and Curtis Priem, three engineers with a vision to revolutionize computer graphics. The name "NVIDIA" is derived from the Latin word *invidia*, meaning "envy," symbolizing the company's ambition to create cutting-edge technology that others would covet. In its early years, NVIDIA focused on developing 3D graphics hardware for the burgeoning PC gaming market.

- **1995**: NVIDIA released its first product, the NV1, a multimedia card that combined 2D and 3D graphics capabilities. Though not a commercial success, it laid the groundwork for future innovations [History of NVIDIA](https://www.techspot.com/article/2283-nvidia-gpu-history/).
- **1999**: The company achieved a major breakthrough with the launch of the GeForce 256, marketed as the world's first GPU. This product introduced hardware transform and lighting (T&L), significantly improving 3D rendering performance and establishing NVIDIA as a dominant player in the graphics market [GeForce 256 Launch](https://www.anandtech.com/show/380).
- **2006**: NVIDIA introduced CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture), a parallel computing platform and programming model that allowed developers to use GPUs for general-purpose computing. This innovation paved the way for NVIDIA's expansion into scientific computing, AI, and machine learning [CUDA Introduction](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone).
- **2010s**: The company shifted focus toward AI and deep learning, with its GPUs becoming the hardware of choice for training neural networks. NVIDIA's data center business grew rapidly as demand for AI workloads surged [AI and NVIDIA](https://www.forbes.com/sites/moorinsights/2021/04/12/nvidia-reinvents-the-data-center-for-ai/).

Throughout its history, NVIDIA has faced competition from companies like AMD and Intel but has maintained a strong market position through continuous innovation and strategic acquisitions, such as the 2020 attempt to acquire Arm Holdings (later abandoned due to regulatory concerns) [Arm Acquisition Attempt](https://www.reuters.com/technology/nvidia-end-40-billion-deal-buy-arm-2022-02-08/).
