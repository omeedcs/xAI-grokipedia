## Historical Background

Prague’s history dates back over a millennium, with its origins traced to the 9th century when it emerged as a settlement under the Přemyslid dynasty. The city became a significant center of power in the Holy Roman Empire during the reign of Charles IV in the 14th century, who established Prague as his imperial capital. Under his rule, key landmarks such as Charles Bridge and St. Vitus Cathedral were constructed, and the city became a hub for arts and learning with the founding of Charles University in 1348, the oldest university in Central Europe [Charles University History](https://www.cuni.cz/UKEN-1.html).

- **Medieval Period**: Prague flourished as a crossroads of trade and culture, benefiting from its location along major European trade routes. It was also a center of religious reform, notably during the Hussite Wars in the 15th century, sparked by the teachings of Jan Hus, a precursor to the Protestant Reformation [Hussite Wars Overview](https://www.britannica.com/event/Hussite-Wars).
- **Habsburg Rule**: From the 16th century, Prague came under Habsburg control, experiencing both prosperity and conflict, including the Thirty Years’ War (1618–1648), which began with the Defenestration of Prague—a pivotal event where Protestant nobles threw Catholic officials out of a castle window [Defenestration of Prague](https://www.history.com/topics/european-history/thirty-years-war).
- **20th Century**: Prague played a central role in the formation of Czechoslovakia in 1918 after the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The city endured Nazi occupation during World War II and later fell under Soviet influence during the Cold War. The 1968 Prague Spring, a period of political liberalization, was crushed by Warsaw Pact forces, marking a dark chapter in the city’s modern history [Prague Spring](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-45268042). The Velvet Revolution of 1989, a peaceful protest movement, ultimately led to the end of communist rule and the establishment of a democratic Czech Republic [Velvet Revolution](https://www.history.com/topics/cold-war/velvet-revolution).
