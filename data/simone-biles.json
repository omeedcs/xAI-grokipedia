  "content": "# Simone Biles\n\nSimone Biles (born March 14, 1997) is an American artistic gymnast recognized as the most successful competitor in the history of the sport, with a record 11 Olympic medals (7 gold, 2 silver, 2 bronze) and 30 World Championship medals (23 gold, 4 silver, 3 bronze). Born in Columbus, Ohio, to a mother struggling with addiction, Biles spent three years in foster care before being adopted at age six by her maternal grandparents, Ronald and Nellie Biles, who provided stability and introduced her to gymnastics during a daycare field trip.  \n\nBiles dominated international competition starting in 2013, winning the all-around title at her first World Championships and accumulating feats such as four golds at the 2016 Rio Olympics, including the first U.S. female gymnast to claim the all-around, vault, and floor exercise events in a single Games. Her routines feature extreme difficulty, with four elements—the Biles, Biles II, Biles on beam, and Biles II on floor—named after her in the Code of Points, reflecting her innovation in elevating the sport's technical standards. At the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, Biles withdrew from most events due to the \"twisties,\" a temporary loss of proprioception causing disorientation in mid-air, prioritizing safety amid immense pressure; she returned for a bronze on balance beam and rebounded triumphantly at the 2024 Paris Games with three golds, solidifying her legacy.  \n\nAs a survivor of sexual abuse by disgraced USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar, Biles has publicly testified about the trauma and institutional failures that enabled it, contributing to reforms in athlete protection while criticizing the FBI's delayed response. Her career highlights causal factors like rigorous training under coach Aimee Boorman and later Laurent Landi, alongside personal resilience forged from early adversity, though her Tokyo experience underscored vulnerabilities to psychological strain in high-stakes elite athletics.\n\n## Early Life and Background\n\n### Childhood and Family Dynamics\n\nSimone Biles was born on March 14, 1997, in Columbus, Ohio, the third of four children to Shanon Biles and Kelvin Clemons. Her biological mother struggled with drug and alcohol addiction, while her father abandoned the family shortly after her birth. These parental challenges, compounded by neglect and financial instability, led to Biles and her siblings entering Ohio's foster care system around age three. The children experienced multiple placements over approximately three years, highlighting the disruptions typical of such environments marked by inconsistent caregiving.\n\nBiles's maternal grandfather, Ron Biles—a retired air force master sergeant—and his wife, Nellie Cayetano Biles, intervened by providing temporary care starting in 2000 while the family was in Ohio. In 2003, at age six, Biles and her younger sister Adria were formally adopted by Ron and Nellie, who relocated them to Spring, Texas, integrating them into a blended household that included the couple's biological children. Biles's older siblings, Ashley and Tevin, were separately adopted by a great-aunt. This family-led adoption offered a stark contrast to prior instability, with Ron and Nellie establishing routines and support that prioritized personal accountability over extended state dependency.\n\nThe shift to a structured home environment under her adoptive parents' guidance fostered Biles's early development of discipline, as evidenced by her later reflections on the security it provided amid prior chaos. Ron and Nellie's initiative in assuming parental roles—drawing on their own experiences with prior foster involvement—demonstrated how individual family agency could mitigate the shortcomings of institutional systems, enabling upward mobility through direct investment in the children's welfare rather than programmatic interventions alone.\n\n### Entry into Gymnastics\n\nAt age six, in 2003, Simone Biles was introduced to gymnastics during a daycare field trip to Bannon's Gymnastix in Houston, Texas, where she participated in a class and impressed coaches with her natural tumbling ability and coordination. The gym staff sent a note home to her adoptive parents, Ron and Nellie Biles, recommending formal enrollment due to her evident raw power and affinity for the sport's explosive elements, such as forward rolls and basic vaults, which she executed with unusual precision for a beginner.\n\nBiles began regular training at Bannon's Gymnastix shortly thereafter under coach Aimee Boorman, who noted her instinctive grasp of gymnastics fundamentals from the outset, allowing rapid progression through recreational levels. Her family provided logistical support for intensive sessions, initially balancing the demands of elementary school with after-school practices that emphasized building strength and technique on floor and beam. By around age eight, Biles entered local junior competitions, where her tumbling passes—featuring back handsprings and basic series—earned high scores relative to peers, as documented in early meet recaps from Texas-level events. This precocious talent in power-based skills distinguished her early development, setting the foundation for advanced training without reliance on conventional flexibility drills.\n\n## Junior Career\n\n### Breakthrough Competitions (2011–2012)\n\nBiles entered the junior elite division in 2011 at age 14, competing at the American Classic in Houston on July 1, where she placed third in the all-around, first on vault, and first on balance beam. Later that year, at the Visa Championships in Saint Paul, Minnesota, from August 18–20, she finished 14th in the all-around, failing to qualify for the junior national team.\n\nIn 2012, Biles, now 15, achieved significant breakthroughs in domestic competitions. At the American Classic in Huntsville, Texas, on May 5, she won the junior all-around title with a score of 56.450, including the highest vault score of 15.900. She followed this with victory at the Secret U.S. Classic in Chicago on May 26, scoring 58.15 in the all-around to edge out Madison Desch by 0.80 points, while also winning vault and tying for second on floor exercise. These performances qualified her for the Visa Championships in St. Louis from June 7–10, where she earned third place in the all-around (115.600), first on vault (16.000, the meet's highest), and third on floor exercise, demonstrating start values that surpassed many peers through elements like her Yurchenko double-twist vault (difficulty 5.8). Her consistent high-difficulty routines positioned her for senior-level eligibility the following year.\n\n## Senior Career\n\n### Debut and Initial Success (2013–2014)\n\nBiles transitioned to senior competition in 2013, marking her international debut at the American Cup in March, where she earned silver behind Katelyn Ohashi. Later that year, at the P\\u0026G Gymnastics Championships in August, she claimed the senior women's all-around title with a total score of 60.500, outperforming competitors through strong performances on vault (15.800), uneven bars (14.750), balance beam (14.900), and floor exercise (15.050).  This victory secured her selection to the U.S. team for the World Championships following the world team trials.\n\nAt the 2013 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Antwerp, Belgium, Biles competed in her first senior world event, winning the all-around gold medal and establishing herself as a dominant force with precise execution and high-difficulty elements driven by exceptional lower-body power and aerial control.  She also secured gold on floor exercise and silver on vault, contributing to the U.S. team's silver medal finish.\n\nIn 2014, Biles defended her national all-around title before excelling at the World Championships in Nanning, China, where the U.S. team won gold. She personally claimed gold medals in the all-around, balance beam, and floor exercise, plus silver on vault, achieving four golds in a single championships—the first woman to do so since Ludmila Tourishcheva in 1974.  Her vault performances featured high start values, including an Amanar, underscoring advantages from biomechanical efficiency in generating rotational force and stability upon landing. This haul highlighted her edge in combining rigorous daily training with innate explosive strength, enabling routines that exceeded peers in both difficulty and consistency.\n\n### Peak Dominance (2015)\n\nSimone Biles demonstrated unparalleled superiority in the 2015 artistic gymnastics season, capturing multiple titles with margins that quantified her edge over the field. At the P\\u0026G U.S. National Championships held August 13–16 in Indianapolis, Indiana, Biles won her third consecutive senior all-around title with a two-day total of 124.100, surpassing silver medalist Maggie Nichols by 4.95 points. She also claimed gold medals on vault (16.250), balance beam, and floor exercise, with her all-around margin exceeding 3 points in individual events, reflecting execution scores that outpaced competitors by wide gaps due to cleaner routines and higher difficulty.\n\nBiles extended this dominance at the 2015 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Glasgow, Scotland, from October 23 to November 1, where she contributed to the U.S. team's gold medal victory by a 5.174-point margin and secured individual gold in the all-around final on October 29 with 60.388, defeating teammate Gabrielle Douglas by 1.083 points—the first woman to win three consecutive world all-around titles.  She added gold on vault and floor exercise, posting a 15.966 on floor—the highest score recorded in that event's history at the time—and earned bronze on balance beam, accumulating five medals including four golds.\n\nThese victories stemmed from rigorous preparation, with Biles training up to 32 hours weekly after shifting to homeschooling to accommodate intensified sessions focused on skill refinement and conditioning. Her margins, particularly over 3 points in U.S. events, highlighted a competitive field gap, as her consistent high execution amid rivals' deductions amplified leads without equivalent international parity at Worlds.\n\n### 2016 Rio Olympics\n\nAt the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Biles competed for the United States in the women's artistic gymnastics events from August 7 to 14. In the team final on August 9, the U.S. team, anchored by Biles' routines including a 15.933 on floor and 15.766 on vault, scored 184.897 to win gold by over eight points ahead of Russia's 176.688, marking the largest margin in Olympic team history under the current code of points. Biles contributed scores across all apparatus, with her performances highlighting the team's depth but also drawing note for internal dynamics where her dominance sometimes overshadowed teammates like Laurie Hernandez, who earned silver on beam.\n\nIn the individual all-around final on August 11, Biles scored 62.198, winning gold by a 2.100-point margin over teammate Aly Raisman (60.098) and nearly four points over bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina (58.665 of Russia), the widest victory gap since the 1988 Seoul Olympics. Her routine totals included 15.866 on vault, 14.800 on bars, 14.733 on beam, and 15.966 on floor, reflecting execution near perfection despite a minor balance check on beam; this margin underscored her technical superiority in an era of open-ended scoring that favors difficulty over the perfect-10 system's constraints faced by predecessors like Nadia Comaneci. Claims of Biles as the \"greatest of all time\" proliferated in media post-event, grounded in her statistical dominance—averaging over 15.0 across events—but tempered by comparisons to historical contexts where lower execution caps limited totals, as evidenced by Comaneci's 1976 all-around score of 79.650 out of 80 under a different regime.\n\nBiles secured additional golds in the vault final on August 14 with 15.966 (ahead of Maria Paseka's 15.553) and floor exercise final on August 16 with 15.966 (over Amy Tinkler and Jade Carey equivalents, though Carey competed later), executing high-difficulty elements like the Amanar vault and triple-double on floor with minimal deductions. On balance beam, she earned bronze with 14.733, behind Sanne Wevers' 15.233 gold and Laurie Hernandez's 15.200 silver, after a fall disrupted her routine amid noted pressure from elevated expectations. These results yielded four golds and one bronze, the most medals by a U.S. female gymnast in a single Olympics, though critics observed the relative ease of her wins against a field diminished by Russian doping disqualifications, with no direct challenge matching her start values. Her five-medal haul propelled a surge in public fame, boosting endorsement value from pre-Rio deals worth about $2 million to projected multimillion-dollar influxes with brands like Hershey's and others capitalizing on her image, while early media scrutiny hinted at mounting pressure from GOAT narratives.\n\n### Hiatus and Resurgence (2017–2018)\n\nFollowing the 2016 Rio Olympics, Biles announced in November 2016 that she would skip the entire 2017 competitive season, including the World Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Montreal, to prioritize personal experiences outside of elite training. She stated the break allowed her to engage in age-appropriate activities, such as obtaining a driver's license and participating in non-gymnastics events, after two years of near-continuous high-intensity competition. This decision aligned with patterns observed in other top gymnasts post-Olympics, where extended rest mitigates cumulative physical strain from repetitive high-impact routines, though Biles later resumed light conditioning in August 2017.\n\nMedia coverage speculated on potential burnout amid the post-Rio spotlight, but Biles attributed her choice primarily to a desire for normalcy rather than explicit exhaustion, with verifiable external pressures including frequent endorsement obligations and public appearances that disrupted routine recovery. Such breaks, while enabling long-term career sustainability by reducing overtraining risks—evidenced by lower injury rates in off-cycle periods—delayed her competitive edge, as subsequent performances revealed execution inconsistencies linked to diminished training volume.\n\nBiles returned to competition at the 2018 U.S. Classic on July 28, winning the all-around with a score of 58.700 despite an uncharacteristic fall on uneven bars, marking her first meet in nearly two years. At the U.S. Gymnastics Championships in August, she secured the all-around title with a two-day total of 119.850, prevailing by a substantial margin and claiming individual event victories across vault, balance beam, uneven bars, and floor exercise.\n\nAt the 2018 World Championships in Doha, Qatar, from October 25 to November 3, Biles led the U.S. team to gold and captured the all-around gold with 57.491 points, overcoming falls on vault and balance beam that incurred deductions but still outscoring Japan's Mai Murakami by 2.267 points. She added golds on vault and floor exercise, a silver on uneven bars, and a bronze on balance beam, becoming the first woman in 31 years to medal in all four events at a single Worlds and the first American to do so. These results demonstrated rust from the hiatus—manifest in higher deduction scores from under-rotations and balance losses—causally tied to reduced preparatory repetitions, as gymnastics precision empirically correlates with sustained high-volume drilling to internalize complex aerial mechanics. Despite imperfections, her dominance persisted, yielding six medals total and affirming the hiatus's role in averting deeper fatigue, though it highlighted trade-offs in short-term sharpness.\n\n### Continued Excellence (2019)\n\nIn August 2019, Biles secured her sixth U.S. national all-around title at the championships in Kansas City, Missouri, posting a two-day total score of 118.500 and winning gold on vault (30.850 aggregate), balance beam (29.650), and floor exercise while placing second on uneven bars. During the competition, she debuted the triple double—a double backflip with three twists—on floor exercise, becoming the first woman to land the skill in competition and earning it the designation Biles II in the International Gymnastics Federation code of points. This element, valued at J difficulty (1.0), highlighted her continued innovation in pushing execution boundaries beyond contemporaries.\n\nAt the 2019 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Stuttgart, Germany, Biles led the U.S. team to gold with a score of 172.330, over six points ahead of Italy. She then claimed her fifth world all-around title on October 10, scoring 58.999—more than two points clear of silver medalist Tang Xijing of China—while topping qualification scores on vault, balance beam, and floor. In event finals, Biles won gold on vault (15.233 in final), balance beam (15.066), and floor exercise, adding a silver on uneven bars to total five medals—four golds and one silver—for the meet. These victories brought her career world medal count to 25, surpassing Belarusian gymnast Vítězslav Scherbo's previous record of 23 and establishing her as the most decorated gymnast in world championships history; 19 of her medals were gold at that point, en route to her current total of 23 world golds.\n\nBiles also introduced a double-twisting double back dismount on beam during qualification, a skill later named after her, further expanding her repertoire of eponymous elements. Her dominance—winning four of five possible individual golds despite competing in an era of heightened global depth—fueled debates on scoring mechanics, with some analysts noting that her routines' extreme difficulty values, derived from skills unmatched by peers, created execution margins that emphasized her separation from the field while prompting questions about whether the system adequately balanced innovation against replicability for fairer competition. The International Gymnastics Federation's valuation of certain Biles elements drew scrutiny for potentially conservative difficulty assignments aimed at discouraging imitation due to injury risks, though her totals reflected verifiable execution under current code provisions.\n\n### Challenges and Tokyo Olympics (2020–2021)\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic led to the postponement of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics to 2021, disrupting USA Gymnastics' competitive calendar and forcing athletes to adapt training regimens amid lockdowns and facility closures. In 2020, USA Gymnastics canceled all top-tier national events, including the U.S. Championships, preventing Biles from defending her title and limiting her competitive opportunities to minimal exhibitions. Biles continued training at her World Champions Centre in Texas, focusing on skill maintenance without the structure of elite meets, which contributed to a hiatus from formal scoring until early 2021.\n\nBiles resumed competition at the 2021 U.S. Classic on May 22, posting an all-around score of 59.100, over five points ahead of second-place Leanne Wong, while debuting the Yurchenko double-pike vault despite execution deductions. At the U.S. Olympic Trials on June 24–27 in St. Louis, she won the all-around with 119.250 across two days, securing automatic selection to the Olympic team alongside Sunisa Lee, with Jordan Chiles, Grace McCallum, and alternates MyKayla Skinner and Jade Carey rounding out the roster based on combined championships and trials performances.\n\nIn Tokyo, the U.S. women's team entered as heavy favorites for gold but earned silver in the July 27 team final with 176.494 points, trailing Russia's 176.998 after Biles withdrew mid-competition following her vault rotation, where she under-rotated due to a loss of air awareness known as the \"twisties\"—a temporary disconnect in proprioceptive and vestibular feedback causing spatial disorientation during aerial twists. The twisties involve mismatched sensory inputs from the inner ear's vestibular system, visual cues, and muscle proprioception, leading to involuntary over- or under-twisting, which poses injury risks without psychological overinterpretation; teammates substituted with stronger routines on bars and beam to mitigate the scoring gap. Biles subsequently opted out of the all-around final on July 29 and event finals except balance beam, where on August 3 she scored 14.000 to claim bronze behind China's Guan Chenchen (14.633) and teammate Ellie Black (14.033). Her absence from multiple events shifted medal opportunities to others but forfeited potential U.S. sweeps, as her difficulty scores were calibrated to anchor the team's totals.\n\n### Return to Form (2023)\n\nBiles resumed competitive gymnastics at the 2023 Core Hydration Classic on August 5 in Chicago, Illinois, marking her first meet since withdrawing from most events at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics due to mental health concerns. She dominated the all-around competition, scoring 59.100 and finishing five points ahead of runner-up Leanne Wong—a margin equivalent to multiple routine deductions in the precision-driven sport. Her standout vault routine, the Yurchenko double pike, earned 15.400, showcasing execution under high difficulty despite a two-year layoff.\n\nAt the U.S. Gymnastics Championships later that August in San Jose, California, Biles won her eighth national all-around title with superior scores across apparatus, surpassing the previous record of seven held by Alfred Jochim since 1933. This performance qualified her for the world championships team while demonstrating technical consistency, including near-perfect landings that minimized deductions observed in her initial return.\n\nBiles anchored the U.S. team to gold at the 2023 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Antwerp, Belgium, from September 30 to October 8, contributing routines that elevated the team's total. In the all-around final on October 6, she scored enough to secure gold ahead of Brazil's Rebeca Andrade, achieving her sixth world all-around title and elevating her career world championships gold medals to 21—an undefeated streak in the event.\n\nOn October 8, Biles won balance beam gold with 14.800, a narrow 0.1-point margin over China's Zhou Yaqin, reflecting precise control that overcame early-season rust evident in minor wobbles. She followed with floor exercise gold at 14.633, despite a mid-routine out-of-bounds step, for her fourth gold of the championships and a total of 23 world golds—tying historical benchmarks for multi-event dominance in a single worlds. These results underscored a return to pre-hiatus execution levels, with Biles later attributing mental clarity gains to therapy, though her baseline athletic capacity enabled rapid adaptation through targeted training.\n\n### 2024 Paris Olympics\n\nBiles contributed to the United States women's team gold medal in the artistic gymnastics team final on July 30, 2024, at the Paris Olympics, where the U.S. scored 172.410 to outperform Italy (171.295) and Brazil (170.973). She recorded 14.733 on vault, 14.600 on balance beam, and 14.366 on floor exercise, anchoring the team with strong performances despite minor errors on uneven bars.  \n\nIn the individual all-around final on August 1, 2024, Biles secured gold with a total score of 59.131, leading silver medalist Rebeca Andrade of Brazil (57.932) by 1.199 points and marking her second Olympic all-around title, the first non-consecutive win in women's gymnastics history. Her routine scores included 15.766 on vault, 13.733 on uneven bars, 14.433 on balance beam, and 15.199 on floor, with a balance beam dismount error preventing a potentially higher total comparable to her 2016 Rio peak.  \n\nBiles won the vault final gold on August 3, 2024, scoring 15.300 on her signature Yurchenko double pike (Biles II), a 5.6 difficulty element she executed cleanly for an 8.000 execution score, contributing to her event total of 30.066 ahead of Andrade's 14.916 average. This marked the first competitive performance of the Biles II under full international judging since its 2023 world championships debut.  \n\nCompeting in the floor exercise final on August 5, 2024, Biles earned silver with 14.033, trailing Andrade's gold-winning 14.733 due to a 0.600 deduction for stepping out of bounds on her final tumbling pass, despite a strong 7.833 execution base. These results yielded three golds and one silver in Paris, bringing her Olympic medal count to 11, including seven golds, tying her with Vera Čáslavská for the second-most decorated female gymnast in history.\n\n### Post-Olympic Developments (2024–2025)\n\nFollowing her success at the 2024 Paris Olympics, Biles featured in the second installment of the Netflix documentary series *Simone Biles Rising*, which premiered on October 25, 2024, and chronicled her qualification at the U.S. Olympic Trials, arrival in Paris, and competition performance. The episodes emphasized her mental health journey and determination amid injury risks during the Games.\n\nIn September 2024, Biles announced plans for her first restaurant venture, *Taste of Gold*, a Tex-Mex establishment set to open in early 2025 at Houston's George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Terminal A near Gate A8. The project, developed in partnership with The Playmakers Group, reflects her self-described identity as a \"foodie at heart.\"\n\nBiles shared updates on her custom-built waterfront mansion in Spring, Texas, which neared completion in late 2024 and was fully finished by October 2025 after over two years of construction. The property includes a lakefront pool, basketball court, and gymnastics-friendly features, with Biles posting videos of her first flip there in mid-October 2025. In the same period, she appeared to confirm undergoing breast augmentation surgery through an Instagram video captioned with a reference to \"new cherries,\" addressing months of public speculation.\n\nRegarding her competitive future, Biles stated in October 2025 that she has not ruled out participating in the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, confirming her presence there but leaving her role—as competitor or otherwise—undecided. Earlier comments in August 2025 echoed this openness, tying decisions to personal timing rather than external pressure. For 2025, she described plans centered on rest, vacations, and community involvement, citing exhaustion from the prior year's demands and prioritizing recovery over intensive training.\n\n## Technical Abilities and Records\n\n### Signature Skills and Innovations\n\nSimone Biles has five eponymous skills codified in the women's artistic gymnastics Code of Points, demonstrating her pioneering advancements in rotational complexity across vault, floor, and balance beam apparatuses.\nThese innovations arise from her explosive lower-body power, cultivated through rigorous strength training, combined with her 1.42-meter stature, which optimizes rotational dynamics by minimizing moment of inertia for faster twists and somersaults under conservation of angular momentum principles.\nHer compact build facilitates tighter body compression during flight, enabling accumulation of multiple twists without destabilizing forces that longer-limbed athletes encounter.\n\nOn vault, the Biles involves a round-off half-on entry to a front handspring onto the table, followed by a layout position with 1½ somersaults and an additional half twist, rated at a difficulty value of 6.0; this maneuver requires immense shoulder and core strength to initiate the extended rotation post-table repulsion.\nThe skill's mechanics demand precise blocking off the vaulting table to convert linear velocity into angular momentum, with the layout phase preserving aesthetic form while accommodating the blind landing's inherent risk.\n\nBiles' floor innovations include the Biles I, a double-double layout featuring two consecutive layout back somersaults each with two twists (totaling four twists across two saltos), valued at an H difficulty (0.6); its execution hinges on segmented twist distribution to maintain control and height.\nThe Biles II elevates this further as a triple-double, comprising a double tucked back somersault with three twists, assigned the rare J rating (0.7) as one of the most demanding floor elements; the tucked position accelerates twist rate via reduced radius, but demands superior air awareness to untwist for landing.\n\nOn balance beam, the Biles dismount consists of two back handsprings into a double tucked somersault backward with two twists, rated F difficulty (0.5); this skill leverages rebound momentum from the beam's spring for height, requiring split-second timing to initiate twists mid-flight without compromising the tucked form's stability.\n\n### Major Achievements and Statistical Milestones\n\nSimone Biles holds the record for the most medals won at the World Artistic Gymnastics Championships, with 30 total (23 gold, 4 silver, 3 bronze) across appearances from 2013 to 2023. Her 23 World Championship golds also set the all-time record for any gymnast in the event. Combined with her Olympic tally, Biles has amassed 41 medals in major international competitions, surpassing previous benchmarks set by gymnasts such as Věra Čáslavská and Larisa Latynina.\n\nIn Olympic competition, Biles has secured 11 medals: 7 gold, 2 silver, and 2 bronze, achieved at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro, 2020 Tokyo (held in 2021), and 2024 Paris Games. She won 4 golds in Rio (team, all-around, vault, floor exercise), tying the record for the most by a female gymnast in a single Olympics and establishing the U.S. women's record for golds in one Games. In Paris, she added 3 golds (team, all-around, vault), contributing to her status as the most decorated U.S. Olympic gymnast with 7 golds overall. Her Olympic all-around victories in 2016 and 2024 mark her as the third woman to win multiple titles and the first to do so in non-consecutive Games.\n\n| Competition | Gold | Silver | Bronze | Total |\n|-------------|------|--------|--------|-------|\n| Olympics   | 7    | 2      | 2      | 11    |\n| World Championships | 23 | 4 | 3 | 30 |\n\nBiles' statistical dominance includes six World all-around titles (2013, 2014, 2015, 2018, 2019, 2023), the most in women's history, alongside her two Olympic all-arounds for eight major titles total. She holds the largest margin of victory in an Olympic all-around final (2.100 points in 2016). These figures reflect exceptional execution under the International Gymnastics Federation's Code of Points, which since 2006 has weighted difficulty scores more heavily than prior systems emphasizing form; this evolution has enabled higher totals in the modern era but complicates direct comparisons to predecessors like Nadia Comăneci (5 Olympic medals, including all-around gold in 1976 under a perfection-based scoring) or Svetlana Khorkina (20 World medals with consistent all-around success across multiple cycles). Her withdrawal from the 2020 Olympic all-around and three events due to mental health concerns underscores variability in participation, contrasting with the unbroken competitive streaks of earlier icons.\n\n## Controversies and Public Scrutiny\n\n### Larry Nassar Abuse Allegations\n\nSimone Biles was sexually abused by Larry Nassar, the longtime physician for USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University, on multiple occasions during her tenure with the U.S. national team, specifically in 2015 and 2016 at training camps including the Karolyi Ranch.  Nassar perpetrated the assaults under the pretense of medical treatments, such as osteopathic manipulations for injuries, a tactic he employed against over 250 identified victims across two decades. Biles publicly disclosed her abuse on January 15, 2018, via Twitter, confirming she was among Nassar's victims and expressing that the experience had lingered despite her athletic successes.\n\nThe abuses were enabled by systemic failures within USA Gymnastics, which received an explicit complaint about Nassar's conduct in July 2015 from the parent of another gymnast but delayed reporting it to the FBI until September 2016, allowing Nassar to continue treating athletes in the interim.  This negligence stemmed from a high-stakes organizational culture that prioritized elite performance and secrecy over athlete welfare, fostering an environment where authority figures like Nassar—trusted for their roles in injury recovery amid grueling training demands—faced insufficient oversight or accountability.  USA Gymnastics and the U.S. Olympic Committee mishandled at least six formal complaints about Nassar between 1997 and 2015 without alerting law enforcement or removing him from duties, contributing to a causal chain of institutional inaction that prolonged the predation. \n\nBiles testified before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee on September 15, 2021, detailing how the abuse and subsequent institutional betrayals compounded her trauma, and criticizing the FBI for delaying its investigation despite early alerts from USA Gymnastics in 2015.  She emphasized that \"the fault doesn't lie with the athletes that were abused, but with the adults that covered it up,\" attributing the scandal to leadership failures at multiple levels rather than isolated incidents. As part of broader survivor actions, Biles joined lawsuits against USA Gymnastics and the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee, culminating in a $380 million settlement in December 2021 for over 500 victims; she also participated in a 2022 class-action suit against the FBI, resolved with a $138.7 million federal payout in April 2024 to 139 claimants for mishandling abuse reports. \n\n### Tokyo Withdrawal and Mental Health Debate\n\nDuring the women's team final at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics on July 27, 2021, Simone Biles withdrew after her opening vault routine, where she executed a simplified Yurchenko double pike instead of her planned triple-twisting double layout, scoring 13.733 and citing a loss of air awareness known as the twisties.  The twisties refer to a temporary mental block in which a gymnast experiences a disconnect between proprioception and spatial orientation during aerial maneuvers, leading to uncontrolled twisting or under-rotation and heightened injury risk from disorientation in flight.  Biles did not compete in the subsequent uneven bars, floor exercise, or balance beam rotations for the team event, contributing to the United States securing a silver medal behind Russia's gold, with teammates Jordan Chiles, Sunisa Lee, and Grace McCallum filling the lineup. \n\nBiles later returned for the balance beam final on July 30, 2021, where she won a bronze medal while performing a downgraded routine, but she withdrew from the individual all-around, vault, and uneven bars finals to prioritize recovery. She described the decision as stemming from mental strain under external pressures, stating, \"I just didn't want to go on\" and emphasizing that her mind and body were \"simply not in sync,\" rejecting claims of quitting due to poor execution. \n\nThe withdrawal sparked polarized reactions, with supporters praising Biles for destigmatizing mental health challenges in high-stakes sports and modeling vulnerability over performative perfection.  USA Gymnastics and fellow athletes like Sam Mikulak lauded the choice as protective against injury, arguing it encouraged broader discussions on athlete well-being amid the sport's physical and psychological demands. Critics, however, contended that the mid-competition exit prioritized personal comfort over team obligations and national expectations, potentially undermining the collective ethos of Olympic representation. \n\nPiers Morgan exemplified detractors' views, labeling the withdrawal a \"joke\" and \"nonsense,\" asserting that elite role models should persevere as past athletes did, such as Kerri Strug's injured 1996 vault for team gold, rather than abandon duties when facing transient blocks like the twisties, which some gymnasts manage through focused spotting or visualization under pressure.   This perspective highlighted contrasts with historical precedents where competitors pushed through comparable aerial disorientation or pain without full withdrawal, questioning whether mental barriers warrant the same exemptions as physical ones in a discipline defined by risk tolerance. The debate underscored tensions between individual agency and communal duty, with the U.S. team's silver finish demonstrating resilience but fueling arguments that Biles' status amplified the perceived abandonment's impact on morale and scoring potential.\n\n### Medical Records Leak\n\nIn September 2016, the Russian hacking group known as Fancy Bears infiltrated the World Anti-Doping Agency's (WADA) Anti-Doping Administration and Management System (ADAMS) database via a phishing attack, leaking confidential medical records of numerous Olympic athletes, including Simone Biles. The breach exposed Therapeutic Use Exemptions (TUEs) granted to Biles for methylphenidate, a stimulant used to treat her attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), following positive tests in samples from August and September 2016. These TUEs permitted legal use of the substance under WADA rules, confirming no doping violations occurred.\n\nUSA Gymnastics issued a statement condemning the hack as an \"unthinkable\" attempt to smear athletes through the illegal acquisition of private medical information, emphasizing that Biles's drug-testing reports complied with all regulations. Biles publicly confirmed her ADHD diagnosis and ongoing prescribed medication, noting that the disclosure stemmed from legitimate therapeutic needs rather than performance enhancement. The incident revealed no undisclosed performance advantages for Biles, as the leaked data pertained solely to approved exemptions for verified medical conditions.\n\nThe hack, linked to Russian state-sponsored actors amid broader geopolitical tensions over doping allegations, underscored systemic cybersecurity vulnerabilities in international sports databases, prompting WADA to enhance protections against phishing and espionage. It shifted scrutiny toward the causal risks of centralized data storage in federations, where inadequate safeguards enabled unauthorized access to sensitive athlete health information without yielding evidence of rule-breaking. No performance-related irregularities were substantiated from Biles's records, reinforcing the legitimacy of TUE processes while exposing the real-world consequences of poor data hygiene in high-stakes athletic governance.\n\n### Political Statements and Transgender Sports Positions\n\nIn August 2024, following her gold medal win in the individual all-around at the Paris Olympics, Simone Biles posted on X (formerly Twitter), \"I love my black job,\" alongside images of herself celebrating, which was widely interpreted as a reference to and mockery of then-candidate Donald Trump's earlier remarks during a July 2024 campaign event where he claimed illegal immigrants were taking \"black jobs\" from African Americans. Trump had clarified the phrase to mean jobs held by Black workers, but Biles' post drew praise from supporters for highlighting perceived insensitivity and criticism from opponents for politicizing her athletic success.\n\nFollowing Donald Trump's victory in the 2024 U.S. presidential election on November 5, Biles urged outgoing President Joe Biden on November 6 to \"stand up\" and \"make some things shake\" during his remaining term, a message interpreted as encouragement for executive actions aligned with Democratic priorities before the January 2025 inauguration. This reflected her alignment with Biden-Harris administration policies, though she had not publicly endorsed Kamala Harris during the campaign, despite unverified rumors of financial contributions circulating online.\n\nIn June 2025, Biles engaged in a public social media dispute with former swimmer and activist Riley Gaines, who had criticized a transgender female high school softball player's participation and championship win in Minnesota girls' sports, arguing it compromised fairness for biological females. Biles responded by calling Gaines a \"sore loser\" and \"sick\" for targeting transgender youth, suggesting instead that advocates uplift the trans community by creating inclusive sports avenues or a dedicated transgender category separate from women's divisions to ensure safety and participation. Gaines countered by invoking Biles' own past trauma from the Larry Nassar abuse scandal to question her empathy for protecting female athletes' spaces.\n\nBiles later apologized on June 10, 2025, clarifying that her comments were not intended to endorse policies eroding fairness in women's sports and emphasizing opposition to publicly shaming children, while reiterating support for a third category for transgender athletes rather than integration into female categories. Critics, including Gaines and fairness advocates, contended that Biles' initial stance overlooked biological realities—such as male puberty conferring irreversible advantages in strength, speed, and injury risk for transgender women in female sports categories—potentially undermining the sex-based protections that enabled female athletic opportunities post-Title IX. Supporters praised her as an ally for prioritizing inclusion and anti-bullying, viewing opposition as rooted in exclusionary rhetoric.\n\nAt the 2025 ESPY Awards on July 17, Biles, while accepting an award, made a tongue-in-cheek remark expressing mock surprise at winning against male nominees, which some interpreted as a subtle nod to the Gaines feud and broader debates on gender-segregated sports, fueling accusations of performative commentary amid her pro-inclusion positions. This drew backlash for irony, given her defense of transgender participation, with detractors arguing it highlighted inconsistencies in addressing sex-based differences in elite competition.\n\n## Personal Life and Off-Field Pursuits\n\n### Relationships and Marriage\n\nBiles was placed in foster care as an infant due to her biological mother's substance abuse issues and was adopted at age six by her maternal grandparents, Ronald and Nellie Biles, who raised her and her younger sister Adria in Spring, Texas. She has publicly credited her adoptive parents with providing the stability that enabled her gymnastics career, referring to them as her mom and dad.\n\nIn March 2020, Biles began a relationship with Jonathan Owens, a professional American football safety who has played for teams including the Houston Texans and Green Bay Packers. The couple announced their engagement on February 15, 2022, and were legally married in a courthouse ceremony in Houston, Texas, on April 22, 2023, followed by a larger destination wedding in Mexico on May 6, 2023.\n\nOwens drew online criticism in late 2023 for podcast remarks portraying himself as the \"catch\" in the relationship and emphasizing traditional male leadership roles, including comments interpreted as claiming authority as the \"man of the house.\" Biles responded by defending Owens, asserting that media outlets distorted his words and that she fully supported his views, stating there was \"nothing foul about it.\" As of October 2025, the couple has no children but has expressed intentions to start a family and involve future offspring in sports.\n\n### Business Ventures and Endorsements\n\nSimone Biles has secured numerous high-profile endorsement deals, leveraging her Olympic success to build a substantial commercial brand. Following her dominant performance at the 2016 Rio Olympics, Biles signed multiyear agreements with brands including Nike (later transitioned to Athleta in 2021), Visa, and United Airlines, among others. Additional partnerships include Procter \\u0026 Gamble (Tide), Hershey Company, Beats by Dre, Uber Eats, Oreo, Mattress Firm, GK Elite, and haircare brand K18, with deals often emphasizing her athletic prowess and personal resilience. These endorsements have been primary drivers of her financial success, as Olympic gymnasts receive no direct salary from USA Gymnastics beyond competition prizes and allowances.\n\nBiles' net worth is estimated at $25 million as of 2025, with the majority derived from endorsement income rather than prize money, which totals under $1 million across her career from events like the Olympics and World Championships. Post-Rio deals reportedly generated annual earnings exceeding $5 million at peak, underscoring how her marketability—rooted in record-breaking feats—translates to off-field revenue streams that dwarf typical gymnast compensation. This commercialization positions Biles as a lifestyle icon, with campaigns extending beyond sport to products like haircare and apparel, potentially amplifying external expectations on her performance and personal narrative.\n\nIn addition to endorsements, Biles has pursued independent business ventures. She authored the memoir *Courage to Soar: A Body in Motion, a Life in Balance* in 2016, which debuted on the New York Times bestseller list and detailed her upbringing and rise in gymnastics, contributing to her early brand diversification. More recently, in September 2024, Biles announced \"Taste of Gold,\" a Tex-Mex restaurant set to open in early 2025 at Houston's George Bush Intercontinental Airport in partnership with the Playmakers Group, marking her entry into hospitality amid her post-Paris Olympics transition. Such expansions reflect a strategic shift toward entrepreneurial pursuits, though they coincide with observations that athlete branding can impose non-sport pressures, diverting focus from training amid the high-stakes demands of elite competition. Empirical patterns in sports economics suggest that while lucrative, such ventures may exacerbate burnout risks for athletes reliant on peak physical condition, as divided commitments challenge the singular focus required for sustained excellence.\n\n### Health and Lifestyle Choices\n\nFollowing her withdrawal from multiple events at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics due to the \"twisties\" and ensuing mental health challenges, Biles engaged in ongoing therapy to rebuild her psychological resilience. She credited weekly therapy sessions with restoring her connection to her body and enabling her dominant performance at the 2024 Paris Olympics, where she secured three gold medals and one silver..com/2024/07/31/simone-biles-credits-therapy-for-her-success-at-the-paris-olympics.html) This approach underscores a deliberate management of mental strain from elite competition pressures, prioritizing recovery over immediate returns to high-stakes performance.\n\nPhysically, Biles has navigated the inherent toll of gymnastics—intense training volumes up to eight hours daily—without chronic injuries that have plagued peers, such as recurrent stress fractures or joint degeneration common in the sport's high-impact demands. Her regimen emphasizes balanced nutrition, including lean proteins like chicken and fish paired with vegetables and complex carbohydrates, to sustain energy and repair without restrictive phases like veganism. This pragmatic fueling, rather than ideological diets, supports sustained elite output into her late 20s.\n\nTo accommodate rigorous training, Biles transitioned to homeschooling at age 14, completing her secondary education in 2015 while forgoing typical social activities for up to 32 hours weekly of gymnastics practice. In adulthood, she pursued stability through real estate, overseeing construction of a custom waterfront mansion in Spring, Texas, completed in October 2025 after over two years of development.\n\nIn October 2025, Biles alluded to undergoing breast augmentation surgery via an Instagram video of herself flipping in her new home's backyard, captioning it with cherry emojis to reference \"new cherries.\" This elective procedure, performed for personal aesthetic reasons post-rumors, contrasts with her prior dissatisfaction from \"baby Botox\" injections in 2024, which caused eyebrow twitching and prompted her to forgo further injectables. While some view such interventions as empowering self-modification, others critique them as unnecessary vanity enhancements amid an athlete's otherwise functional physique shaped by years of disciplined training.",
