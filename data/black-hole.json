  "content": "# Black hole\n\nA black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape from it once it passes a boundary known as the event horizon. This boundary marks the point of no return, beyond which the escape velocity exceeds the speed of light, rendering the region causally disconnected from the rest of the universe. At the center lies a singularity, a point of theoretically infinite density where the laws of general relativity break down, though quantum effects may alter this picture.\n\nBlack holes are predicted by Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, which describes how mass warps spacetime, and they form primarily through the gravitational collapse of massive stars or other processes in the early universe. Stellar-mass black holes, typically 5 to dozens of times the mass of the Sun, arise when the core of a star more than about 20 times the Sun's mass exhausts its nuclear fuel and implodes in a supernova explosion. Supermassive black holes, with masses ranging from millions to billions of solar masses, reside at the centers of most galaxies, including the Milky Way's Sagittarius A* at about 4 million solar masses; their origins remain partially mysterious but likely involve rapid growth from seed black holes via accretion of gas, mergers with other black holes, or direct collapse of massive gas clouds in the young universe. Intermediate-mass black holes, between hundreds and thousands of solar masses, are rarer and may form from the merger of stellar-mass black holes in dense star clusters.\n\nBlack holes are invisible directly but reveal themselves through their gravitational influence on nearby matter and light, such as bending starlight or accelerating gas in glowing accretion disks that can outshine entire galaxies. Their existence has been confirmed via multiple methods: orbital dynamics of stars around galactic centers, X-ray emissions from hot accretion material, gravitational waves detected from merging black holes by observatories like LIGO, and direct imaging of the shadow cast by the event horizon, as achieved by the Event Horizon Telescope for M87* in 2019 and Sagittarius A* in 2022. These observations not only validate general relativity in extreme conditions but also probe fundamental questions about spacetime, quantum gravity, and the evolution of the cosmos.\n\n## History\n\n### Theoretical foundations in general relativity\n\nThe theory of general relativity, developed by Albert Einstein and published in its complete form in 1915, establishes the essential framework for black hole theory by reinterpreting gravity not as a force but as the curvature of spacetime induced by mass and energy. A cornerstone of this theory is the equivalence principle, first articulated by Einstein in 1907, which asserts that locally, the physical effects of a uniform gravitational field are indistinguishable from those experienced in a uniformly accelerated reference frame. This principle implies that in a small enough region of spacetime, the laws of physics reduce to those of special relativity, with gravity manifesting as a deviation from flat spacetime geometry.\n\nBuilding on this, general relativity describes spacetime as a dynamic, four-dimensional manifold whose curvature, governed by Einstein's field equations \\( G_{\\mu\\\nu} = \\frac{8\\pi G}{c^4} T_{\\mu\\\nu} \\), dictates the motion of matter and light along geodesics. For black hole geometries, this curvature becomes extreme near concentrated masses, creating regions where spacetime paths lead to inescapable outcomes for infalling objects. The equivalence principle thus serves as a prerequisite, ensuring that gravitational effects are geometrically encoded rather than treated as external forces, setting the stage for exact solutions that reveal such pathologies.\n\nIn late 1915, shortly after Einstein finalized his field equations, Karl Schwarzschild obtained the first exact vacuum solution for a spherically symmetric, non-rotating mass, published in January 1916 while he was serving on the Eastern Front in World War I. Schwarzschild's approach assumed a static metric with spherical symmetry outside the mass, where the stress-energy tensor vanishes (\\( T_{\\mu\\\nu} = 0 \\)), reducing Einstein's equations to a set of ordinary differential equations for the metric components. By imposing boundary conditions of asymptotic flatness (matching Minkowski spacetime at infinity) and coordinate regularity, he solved for the line element, yielding the Schwarzschild metric:\n\n\\[\nds^2 = -\\left(1 - \\frac{2GM}{c^2 r}\\right) c^2 dt^2 + \\left(1 - \\frac{2GM}{c^2 r}\\right)^{-1} dr^2 + r^2 (d\\\theta^2 + \\sin^2\\\theta d\\phi^2),\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( G \\) is the gravitational constant, \\( M \\) the enclosed mass, \\( c \\) the speed of light, and \\( r, \\\theta, \\phi \\) are spherical coordinates. This metric is regular everywhere except at \\( r = 0 \\), describing the external gravitational field of a point mass or spherically symmetric body like a star.\n\nThe Schwarzschild solution introduced the concept of highly curved spacetime regions where radial geodesics for light and matter could become trapped, preventing escape to infinity, though Schwarzschild himself did not interpret this as a physical \"black hole.\" Einstein, however, expressed strong skepticism toward the physical implications of such solutions, viewing singularities as mathematical artifacts rather than real phenomena. In a 1939 paper, he analyzed orbiting particles in Schwarzschild spacetime and concluded that relativistic effects would stabilize configurations, preventing collapse into inescapable regions: \"The essential result of this investigation is that the Schwarzschild singularities do not exist in physical reality.\" This metric later inspired extensions, such as the Kerr solution for rotating masses.\n\n### Development of the black hole concept (1916–1960s)\n\nThe concept of black holes evolved from abstract solutions in general relativity to a recognized astrophysical phenomenon during this period, building on the Schwarzschild metric derived in 1916 as the foundation for describing spacetime around a non-rotating, uncharged mass. Early extensions included solutions for charged black holes, such as the Reissner-Nordström metric, independently discovered by Hans Reissner in 1916 and Gunnar Nordström in 1918. This metric modifies the Schwarzschild geometry by incorporating an electric charge \\( Q \\), resulting in two event horizons at radii \\( r_\\pm = M \\pm \\sqrt{M^2 - Q^2} \\) (in units where \\( G = c = 1 \\)), where the inner horizon separates regions of extreme spacetime curvature, though such highly charged objects are unlikely in nature due to rapid neutralization.\n\nA key precursor to understanding stellar collapse was Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar's 1931 calculation of the maximum mass for a stable white dwarf, approximately 1.4 solar masses, beyond which relativistic effects cause instability and potential gravitational collapse. This limit highlighted that sufficiently massive stars could not support themselves against gravity via electron degeneracy pressure, setting the stage for further investigation into endpoint states. In 1939, J. Robert Oppenheimer and Hartland Snyder published a seminal analysis of dust cloud collapse in general relativity, demonstrating that a star exceeding the Chandrasekhar limit would inexorably contract to form a singularity hidden behind an event horizon, appearing \"frozen\" to distant observers due to extreme gravitational time dilation—though they did not use modern terminology, their work described what are now known as black holes.\n\nDespite these advances, the physical reality of such objects faced significant skepticism. Albert Einstein himself opposed the idea in a 1939 paper, arguing that centrifugal forces from particle motion would prevent complete collapse to a singularity in a realistic star, maintaining spherical symmetry while attempting to resolve the apparent paradoxes of the Schwarzschild solution. This debate persisted into the 1960s, with parallel developments in the Soviet Union where Yakov Zel'dovich and Igor Novikov explored gravitational collapse dynamics, emphasizing the inevitability of horizon formation in massive stars and introducing the term \"frozen star\" to describe these trapped, radiating objects, thereby bridging theoretical models with astrophysical implications.\n\nTheoretical progress accelerated with Roy Kerr's 1963 derivation of the metric for a rotating black hole, extending the Reissner-Nordström solution to include angular momentum \\( a = J/M \\), where the event horizon is at \\( r_+ = M + \\sqrt{M^2 - a^2} \\) and an ergosphere allows energy extraction via frame-dragging effects. This \"golden age\" of black hole research culminated in John Archibald Wheeler's popularization of the term \"black hole\" in 1967 during a public lecture, shifting the concept from mathematical curiosity to a widely accepted prediction of general relativity with profound astrophysical consequences.\n\n### Observational pursuits and early evidence (1970s–2000s)\n\nThe discovery of Cygnus X-1 marked a pivotal shift toward observational evidence for black holes, beginning with its identification as a bright X-ray source by the UHURU satellite in 1971. Subsequent optical spectroscopy revealed it as a binary system with a supergiant companion, where dynamical analysis indicated a compact companion exceeding 8 solar masses—well above the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit for neutron stars—implying a stellar-mass black hole accreting material and emitting X-rays from a hot accretion disk. This system, located about 6,000 light-years away in the constellation Cygnus, became the first widely accepted black hole candidate, with X-ray variability providing further support for the accretion model.\n\nBuilding on this foundation, the 1990s saw a surge in identifications of stellar-mass black holes through X-ray transients in binary systems, enabled by observatories like the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory and Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer. Systems such as GRS 1915+105, discovered in 1992, exhibited superluminal radio jets and X-ray outbursts consistent with a black hole of approximately 14 solar masses, confirmed via orbital dynamics of its low-mass companion. Similarly, GRO J0422+32, an X-ray nova outburst in 1992, yielded mass estimates around 3.6–4 solar masses from radial velocity measurements, reinforcing the black hole interpretation by exceeding neutron star limits. These measurements, often derived from spectroscopic orbits and light-curve modeling, established a growing population of ~10–20 solar mass black holes in Galactic binaries, solidifying indirect evidence through accretion signatures and mass functions.\n\nObservations of quasars and active galactic nuclei (AGN) during the 1970s–2000s provided compelling indirect evidence for supermassive black holes powering these luminous phenomena. Quasars, first noted in the 1960s, were linked to central engines involving accretion onto masses of millions to billions of solar masses, as their immense luminosities (up to 10^47 ergs/s) required compact, high-efficiency sources unattainable by other mechanisms. By the 1990s, reverberation mapping of broad emission lines in nearby AGN like NGC 5548 measured time delays between continuum and line variations, yielding black hole masses around 10^7 solar masses and virialized broad-line regions orbiting at Keplerian speeds. These techniques, applied to Seyfert galaxies and quasars, demonstrated that AGN activity stems from accretion disks around supermassive black holes, with radio and optical spectra showing relativistic jets and ionized gas dynamics consistent with this model.\n\nEarly gravitational lensing studies in the late 1970s and 1980s offered additional indirect confirmation of general relativity's predictions for massive objects, including black holes. The discovery of the double quasar Q0957+561 in 1979, where light from a single quasar at redshift z=1.41 was split into two images by an intervening galaxy's gravity, provided the first clear example of strong lensing, with image separations and time delays matching Einstein's theory for a total lensing mass of ~10^11 solar masses. Subsequent 1980s observations, such as the quadruply lensed Einstein Cross (Q2237+030) in 1985, revealed aligned quasar images distorted by a foreground galaxy, implying compact mass concentrations that aligned with models incorporating central supermassive black holes to explain the lens potential. These alignments, observed via optical and radio interferometry, ruled out alternative explanations like multiple quasars and supported the presence of extreme gravitational fields from black hole-dominated cores.\n\nRadio astronomy played a crucial role in probing the Milky Way's center, leading to the identification of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) as a supermassive black hole candidate from the 1970s to 1990s. In 1974, very-long-baseline interferometry resolved Sgr A* as a compact, non-thermal radio source with a size under 10 astronomical units at the galactic center, distinct from extended emission and suggestive of a self-absorbed synchrotron source powered by accretion. Proper motion studies of stars near Sgr A* using infrared speckle imaging and adaptive optics, starting in the 1990s and refined in the 2000s, revealed orbital velocities up to 1,000 km/s around an unseen mass of approximately 4 million solar masses (as of 2008 estimates) confined to a volume smaller than our solar system, consistent only with a supermassive black hole. These radio and near-infrared observations, tracking stars like S2 over decades, provided dynamical evidence for a point-mass singularity, bridging Galactic and extragalactic black hole populations.\n\n### Etymology and terminology\n\nPrior to the widespread adoption of the term \"black hole,\" physicists referred to these objects using more descriptive phrases. In the early 20th century, they were often called \"Schwarzschild singularities\" after the metric describing the spacetime around a non-rotating, uncharged mass. By the 1960s, Soviet scientists like Igor Novikov and Yakov Zeldovich used \"frozen stars\" to describe the apparent halting of collapse due to infinite time dilation for distant observers. American and European researchers, including John Wheeler, employed terms such as \"collapsars\" for collapsing stars and \"gravitationally completely collapsed stars\" to emphasize the total implosion under general relativity.\n\nThe term \"black hole\" was introduced by physicist John Archibald Wheeler during a public lecture on December 29, 1967, at the American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in New York City. Wheeler recalled that the name emerged from an audience suggestion during the talk, possibly inspired by earlier analogies, and he popularized it further in a 1968 article for general audiences. This vivid phrase quickly replaced earlier terminology, aiding public and scientific communication about these enigmatic objects.\n\nThe etymology of \"black hole\" draws from an 18th-century British colonial incident known as the Black Hole of Calcutta, where 146 prisoners were confined in a small dungeon in 1756, and only 23 survived due to suffocating conditions, evoking a place of inescapable doom. Physicist Robert Dicke first applied this metaphor to collapsed stars in lectures around 1960–1961, likening their inescapable gravity to the prison's lethality. Wheeler adapted it to capture the idea of a region in spacetime from which nothing, not even light, can escape.\n\nTerminology varies across languages and scientific traditions, reflecting cultural adaptations. In French, it is \"trou noir,\" directly translating to \"black hole\" but initially resisted in some circles due to slang connotations. Spanish uses \"agujero negro,\" Italian \"buco nero,\" and German \"Schwarzes Loch,\" maintaining the core imagery of darkness and void. These translations have standardized globally through international collaborations like the Event Horizon Telescope project.\n\nIn modern usage, black holes are distinguished by mass: stellar-mass black holes (typically 3–100 solar masses, formed from stellar collapse) versus supermassive black holes (millions to billions of solar masses, residing in galactic centers). Outdated terms like \"Schwarzschild singularity\" are avoided in favor of \"black hole\" to encompass rotating (Kerr) and charged (Reissner–Nordström) variants, emphasizing the event horizon over the central singularity.\n\n## Properties\n\n### Physical characteristics\n\nBlack holes are primarily classified by their mass into three categories: stellar-mass, intermediate-mass, and supermassive. Stellar-mass black holes, formed from the collapse of massive stars, typically have masses ranging from about 3 to 100 times that of the Sun (M⊙). Intermediate-mass black holes occupy the range of 100 to 100,000 M⊙, bridging the gap between stellar remnants and larger systems, with strong evidence for their existence from recent observations, particularly gravitational wave detections, though their formation mechanisms continue to be investigated. Supermassive black holes, residing at the centers of most galaxies, span masses from 10⁶ to 10¹⁰ M⊙, with examples like Sagittarius A* in the Milky Way at approximately 4 × 10⁶ M⊙.\n\nA fundamental aspect of black hole physics is the no-hair theorem, which states that stationary black holes in general relativity are fully characterized by just three parameters: their mass \\(M\\), electric charge \\(Q\\), and angular momentum \\(J\\). For nearly all astrophysical black holes, the charge \\(Q\\) is negligible due to rapid neutralization by surrounding plasma, reducing the description to \\(M\\) and \\(J\\). This theorem implies that black holes possess no \"hair\"—no additional multipole moments or internal structure beyond these parameters—erasing details of their progenitor matter during formation.\n\nThe angular momentum \\(J\\) of a rotating black hole is constrained by the extremal limit \\( J \\leq \\frac{G M^2}{c} \\), beyond which the event horizon would disappear, violating cosmic censorship. Standard theoretical models assume isolated, eternal black holes in vacuum, asymptotically flat spacetimes, disregarding external magnetic fields or infalling matter that could introduce complications in realistic astrophysical environments.\n\nBlack holes distinguish themselves from other compact objects like neutron stars through mass limits imposed by general relativity. Neutron stars, supported by neutron degeneracy pressure against gravity, have a maximum stable mass of roughly 2–3 M⊙, as determined by solutions to the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff equation; beyond this, collapse to a black hole is inevitable. For instance, observed neutron stars like PSR J0952−0607 reach about 2.35 M⊙ (as of 2022), while objects exceeding 3 M⊙, such as those detected via gravitational waves, confirm black hole formation.\n\nTo convey their extreme compactness, consider scales: a non-rotating black hole of one solar mass has a Schwarzschild radius—the radius of its event horizon—of approximately 3 km, comparable to a small city's size yet containing the Sun's entire mass. This metric describes the simplest case of a non-rotating, uncharged black hole.\n\n### Event horizon and metric descriptions\n\nThe event horizon marks the boundary of a black hole's spacetime region from which no causal signals can escape to reach distant observers, functioning as a one-way membrane that traps light and matter once crossed. In the simplest case of a non-rotating, uncharged black hole, described by the Schwarzschild metric, this horizon forms a spherical surface at the Schwarzschild radius, defined as\n\n\\[\nr_s = \\frac{2GM}{c^2},\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(G\\) is the gravitational constant, \\(M\\) is the black hole's mass, and \\(c\\) is the speed of light. This radius quantifies the scale at which the escape velocity equals the speed of light, rendering the interior causally disconnected from the exterior universe.\n\nThe Schwarzschild coordinates, in which the metric is originally expressed, exhibit a coordinate singularity at the event horizon, where the metric component \\(g_{tt}\\) vanishes and radial null geodesics appear to terminate abruptly. This artifact leads to apparent geodesic incompleteness, as timelike and null geodesics reaching the horizon seem to end finitely in finite affine parameter, suggesting a breakdown in the spacetime description. To resolve this, Kruskal-Szekeres coordinates extend the manifold maximally, revealing that the singularity is removable at the horizon itself; the extended coordinates cover both the exterior and interior regions smoothly, demonstrating that geodesics continue through the horizon without incompleteness there, though true physical incompleteness arises deeper in the spacetime.\n\nFor rotating black holes, modeled by the Kerr metric, the event horizon structure differs significantly due to angular momentum. Instead of a single sphere, there exist an outer event horizon enclosing the black hole's exterior and an inner Cauchy horizon separating regions within; the outer horizon acts as the primary no-escape boundary, while the inner one marks a surface of potential instability. Additionally, the ergosphere—a oblate region outside the outer horizon but inside the stationary limit surface—forces all objects to co-rotate with the black hole, enabling unique dynamical effects without crossing the horizon itself.\n\nWithin the ergosphere of a Kerr black hole, the Penrose process allows for the extraction of rotational energy by permitting particles to split such that one fragment carries negative energy relative to infinity and falls inward, while the other escapes with increased energy, effectively reducing the black hole's spin. This mechanism highlights the horizon's role in mediating energy transfer, with the escaping particle gaining up to 20.7% more energy than the incoming one for maximal spin, though practical astrophysical realization remains theoretical.\n\nAs an infalling observer approaches the event horizon, tidal forces—arising from the gradient in gravitational acceleration across the object's extent—intensify, stretching it radially while compressing it transversely, a process termed spaghettification. For stellar-mass black holes, these forces become lethal well outside the horizon due to the steep tidal gradient, whereas for supermassive black holes, an observer might cross the horizon intact before spaghettification occurs deeper in. This effect underscores the horizon's position as the threshold where inescapable tidal disruption transitions from external to internal dynamics.\n\n### Singularity and no-hair theorem\n\nAt the core of a black hole lies a singularity, defined as a point where the curvature of spacetime becomes infinite, resulting in a breakdown of the geometric structure and geodesic incompleteness. This manifests as infinite tidal forces and density, where general relativity predicts the failure of physical laws as described by the Einstein field equations. Singularities in black holes are classified into spacetime singularities, characterized by the incompleteness of causal curves such that geodesics cannot be extended indefinitely, and scalar singularities, where scalar curvature invariants like the Kretschmann scalar diverge./06%3A_Vacuum_Solutions/6.04%3A_Black_Holes_(Part_1)) The Hawking-Penrose singularity theorems establish that such singularities inevitably form in gravitational collapse under realistic conditions, including those leading to black holes.\n\nThe no-hair theorem, also known as the black hole uniqueness theorem, asserts that any stationary, asymptotically flat black hole solution to the Einstein-Maxwell equations is uniquely determined by three parameters: its mass \\(M\\), electric charge \\(Q\\), and angular momentum \\(J\\). The proof begins with Israel's 1967 demonstration for static, uncharged black holes, showing that the event horizon must be spherical and the exterior metric matches the Schwarzschild solution, using the positive mass theorem and asymptotic flatness to rule out other configurations. Carter extended this in 1971 to axisymmetric, rotating, uncharged cases, employing separability of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation to derive conserved quantities and rigidity theorems that fix the metric to the Kerr form. Hawking in 1972 generalized to stationary spacetimes without assuming axisymmetry, proving horizon regularity implies the existence of a Killing vector and uniqueness via stability analysis of the vacuum equations. Robinson completed the electrovac case in 1975 by showing that any deviation from the Kerr-Newman metric would induce unstable electromagnetic perturbations, enforcing uniqueness.\n\nA key implication of the no-hair theorem is the irreversible loss of detailed information about infalling matter: once material crosses the event horizon, the black hole's external properties reflect only the aggregate \\(M\\), \\(Q\\), and \\(J\\), erasing specifics like chemical composition or quantum state structure. This \"baldness\" underscores the theorem's role in simplifying black hole descriptions while highlighting classical general relativity's predictive limitations for complex collapse scenarios. The event horizon serves as the mechanism concealing this singularity from external observers.\n\nTo address the pathological nature of exposed singularities, Roger Penrose proposed the cosmic censorship hypothesis in 1969, conjecturing that generic gravitational collapse in physically realistic initial conditions produces singularities always hidden behind an event horizon, preventing \"naked\" singularities that would violate causality and predictability. This weak form posits that no naked singularities arise in asymptotically flat spacetimes from regular matter distributions satisfying the dominant energy condition.\n\nChallenges to cosmic censorship arise in idealized cases, such as overcharged Reissner-Nordström black holes where \\(|Q| \\u003e M\\), yielding a naked singularity with repulsive gravitational effects and no horizon. Similarly, overspun Kerr black holes with \\(|J| \\u003e M^2\\) exhibit ring-like naked singularities, where high angular momentum prevents horizon formation and allows timelike geodesics to reach the singularity directly. These configurations, though unstable and non-generic under perturbations, question the hypothesis's universality in extremal limits.\n\n### Spacetime features around black holes\n\nAround a non-rotating black hole described by the Schwarzschild metric, spacetime exhibits a distinctive region known as the photon sphere, located at a radius of \\(1.5 r_s\\), where \\(r_s = 2GM/c^2\\) is the Schwarzschild radius. This sphere marks the location of unstable circular orbits for photons, allowing light rays to temporarily circle the black hole before either escaping or spiraling inward. Perturbations cause these orbits to deviate, with photons inside the photon sphere inevitably falling toward the event horizon.\n\nFor massive particles in the Schwarzschild geometry, stable circular orbits exist outside the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) at \\(r = 6GM/c^2 = 3 r_s\\). Beyond the ISCO lies the plunging region, where orbits become unstable and particles inexorably spiral toward the event horizon due to the breakdown of the effective potential barrier. These features arise from the geodesic equations governing motion in the curved spacetime, highlighting the transition from bound orbits to direct infall.\n\nIn the rotating case, the Kerr metric introduces additional complexity due to the black hole's angular momentum, with spacetime features parameterized solely by mass \\(M\\) and spin \\(a\\) per the no-hair theorem. The ergosphere emerges as an oblate region outside the event horizon where the metric component \\(g_{tt} \\u003e 0\\), prohibiting stationary observers because frame-dragging forces all objects to co-rotate with the black hole. This frame-dragging effect, strongest near the poles at \\(r = r_s\\) and extending to \\(r \\approx 2 r_s\\) in the equatorial plane for maximal spin, warps light cones such that no timelike path can remain at rest.\n\nFor Kerr black holes, the ISCO radius varies with spin and orbital direction: \\(r = 6GM/c^2\\) for non-rotating cases, shrinking to \\(r = GM/c^2 = 0.5 r_s\\) for prograde orbits around an extremal (\\(a = GM/c\\)) black hole, while retrograde orbits extend to \\(r = 9GM/c^2 = 4.5 r_s\\). Particles crossing the prograde ISCO enter the plunging region, accelerating toward the horizon while gaining azimuthal velocity from frame-dragging. The Lense-Thirring precession, a direct consequence of this spin-induced frame-dragging, causes the orbital plane of nearby objects to precess around the black hole's spin axis at a rate proportional to \\(a / r^3\\). This effect distorts equatorial orbits into rosettes and aligns misaligned disks over time.\n\n## Formation and evolution\n\n### Stellar gravitational collapse\n\nStellar-mass black holes form through the gravitational collapse of the cores of massive stars with initial masses exceeding approximately 20 solar masses at the end of their nuclear burning phases. These stars undergo successive stages of fusion, progressively building heavier elements until an iron core develops, as iron fusion absorbs rather than releases energy, halting further nuclear reactions and depriving the core of thermal pressure support.\n\nThe iron core grows via silicon burning and infall of overlying layers until it nears the Chandrasekhar mass of about 1.4 solar masses, at which point electron degeneracy pressure fails under increasing gravity, triggering implosion at speeds approaching half the speed of light. Collapse halts briefly at nuclear densities around 10^14 g/cm³, where the stiff repulsion of neutron-rich matter induces a hydrodynamic bounce, launching an outward shock wave and forming a compact proto-neutron star. This shock typically stalls in the infalling envelope due to energy losses, but neutrinos emitted copiously from the hot proto-neutron star (~10 MeV temperatures) deposit energy behind the shock through absorption and scattering, potentially reviving it to drive a successful explosion that ejects most of the star's mass. Failure of this neutrino-driven mechanism, often in cases of higher core mass or entropy, results in continued accretion onto the proto-neutron star, leading to its collapse into a black hole.\n\nThe stability of the proto-neutron star is governed by the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation, which defines an upper mass limit of roughly 2–3 solar masses beyond which neutron degeneracy pressure cannot resist gravitational compression, prompting inevitable further collapse to a black hole. This limit arises from balancing hydrostatic equilibrium in general relativity for degenerate fermionic matter and has been refined through modern equations of state, confirming its role in distinguishing neutron star from black hole outcomes in core collapse.\n\nThree-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of core collapse demonstrate that rapid rotation can amplify magnetic fields and generate bipolar jets via magnetorotational instability, potentially aiding explosion in some progenitors, but moderate or slow rotation often results in failed explosions and prompt black hole formation as the core accretes without sufficient angular support to form a stable disk.\n\nFor progenitors with initial masses in the range of 140–260 solar masses, pair production of electron-positron pairs from gamma rays in the oxygen-burning core reduces radiation pressure abruptly, triggering pulsations that eject the envelope in a pair-instability supernova, completely disrupting the star and preventing any compact remnant including a black hole.\n\nIn very massive stars above roughly 50–100 solar masses, especially those with low metallicity and weak winds that retain extended envelopes, the entire structure can undergo direct collapse without a preceding explosion or significant mass loss, as the outer layers fall inward unimpeded, overwhelming the core and forming a black hole with minimal electromagnetic signature.\n\n### Primordial and supermassive black holes\n\nPrimordial black holes (PBHs) are hypothetical black holes that could have formed in the very early universe due to density fluctuations in the post-Big Bang era, shortly after the initial expansion began. These fluctuations, if exceeding a critical threshold, would lead to gravitational collapse on scales comparable to the particle horizon at that epoch. The concept was first proposed by Stephen Hawking, who argued that such collapses could produce black holes with a wide range of masses, from as low as approximately \\(10^{-5}\\) grams—near the Planck mass—up to thousands of solar masses, depending on the cosmic time of formation.\n\nUnlike stellar black holes, PBHs do not require the prior evolution of massive stars and could have originated directly from primordial inhomogeneities amplified during inflation or other early-universe processes. Their formation is predicted within standard general relativity, where regions denser than the average background would collapse into black holes if the overdensity surpasses the Jeans criterion adapted for the expanding universe. PBHs in the mass range of \\(10^{15}\\) to \\(10^{17}\\) grams, for instance, could theoretically survive until the present day without evaporating via Hawking radiation, potentially contributing to the cosmic dark matter density.\n\nSupermassive black hole (SMBH) seeds in the early universe may form through the direct collapse of massive, pristine gas clouds in metal-poor atomic cooling halos, bypassing the need for stellar remnants. This process occurs in protogalactic environments at redshifts \\(z \\gtrsim 10\\), where ultraviolet radiation from nearby star-forming regions suppresses molecular hydrogen cooling, leading to hot, gravitationally unstable gas cores that collapse isothermally at temperatures around 10,000 K. The resulting black holes would have seed masses of \\(10^4\\) to \\(10^5\\) solar masses, providing a rapid pathway to the billion-solar-mass SMBHs observed in high-redshift quasars.\n\nThese direct-collapse seeds are thought to play a crucial role in seeding the central black holes of early galaxies, particularly those powering quasars at redshifts \\(z \\u003e 6\\), where luminous activity requires efficient growth from massive initial seeds to explain the short timescales available since the Big Bang. Simulations indicate that such seeds can accrete gas at super-Eddington rates in the dense early-universe conditions, facilitating the assembly of SMBHs with masses exceeding \\(10^9\\) solar masses by \\(z \\approx 6\\).\n\nIntermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs), with masses between \\(10^2\\) and \\(10^5\\) solar masses, represent a transitional category and can form through dynamical processes in dense stellar environments, distinct from both primordial and direct-collapse mechanisms. In globular clusters, IMBHs may arise from the merger of stellar-mass black holes via hierarchical interactions in the cluster core, where repeated binary-single encounters lead to mass growth. Alternatively, runaway stellar collisions in young, dense star clusters can produce a very massive star that collapses directly into an IMBH, with core densities exceeding \\(10^6\\) stars per cubic parsec enabling such collisions on timescales of a few million years.\n\nDespite extensive theoretical modeling, no PBHs have been directly detected, and observational constraints from microlensing, cosmic microwave background distortions, and gravitational wave events limit their abundance to less than 1% of the dark matter in most mass ranges, though windows remain open for PBHs around \\(10^{-12}\\) to \\(10^{-11}\\) solar masses or asteroid-mass scales (\\(10^{17}\\) grams) as potential partial dark matter constituents. These constraints arise from the absence of expected signatures, such as gamma-ray bursts from evaporating PBHs or disruptions in galactic dynamics, underscoring the challenge of confirming their existence amid ongoing searches with facilities like the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna.\n\n### Growth through accretion and mergers\n\nBlack holes increase their mass through two primary mechanisms: the accretion of surrounding gas and dust, and mergers with other black holes. Accretion involves the infall of matter onto the event horizon, converting a fraction of the infalling mass into energy via gravitational potential, while mergers occur during close encounters in dense stellar or galactic environments, leading to the coalescence of binary systems.\n\nIn low-density, quiescent environments, such as the interstellar medium far from active galactic nuclei, accretion proceeds spherically symmetrically under the Bondi model. This process assumes steady, adiabatic inflow of gas at rest at infinity, with the accretion rate given by \\(\\dot{M}_B \\propto M^2 \\rho / c_s^3\\), where \\(M\\) is the black hole mass, \\(\\rho\\) is the ambient gas density, and \\(c_s\\) is the sound speed. The Bondi radius, \\(r_B = GM/c_s^2\\), defines the capture sphere beyond which gravity dominates thermal motion, enabling efficient infall for supermassive black holes in galactic halos.\n\nMore commonly, accretion occurs in rotating systems forming viscous disks around the black hole, as described by the Shakura-Sunyaev model. In this framework, angular momentum transport via viscosity allows matter to spiral inward, with thin disks prevailing in moderately luminous sources where radiative cooling maintains a geometrically slim structure, and thick disks in high-accretion-rate scenarios dominated by radiation pressure and electron scattering opacity. The radiative efficiency reaches approximately 10% for matter approaching the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO), where prograde orbits around a spinning black hole enable deeper gravitational binding before plunging.\n\nMergers contribute significantly to black hole growth, particularly for supermassive black holes (SMBHs), through hierarchical processes in dense environments like nuclear star clusters or active galactic nuclei disks. In these settings, stellar-mass black holes or intermediate-mass seeds repeatedly pair and coalesce, with each merger increasing the total mass and potentially forming more massive progenitors that sink toward galactic centers via dynamical friction. Simulations indicate that such chains can rapidly build SMBHs from stellar seeds within a few billion years, consistent with quasar observations at high redshifts.\n\nAsymmetric emission of gravitational waves during mergers imparts a recoil kick to the remnant black hole, arising from the non-spherical radiation pattern. Numerical relativity calculations show that kicks can reach velocities up to several thousand km/s, with a maximum of approximately 5000 km/s for unequal-mass binaries with spins misaligned in the orbital plane, potentially ejecting the remnant from its host galaxy or disrupting further hierarchical growth.\n\nThe spin parameter \\(a\\) (dimensionless, ranging from 0 to 1) evolves distinctly under these processes. Accretion preferentially aligns the black hole spin with the disk angular momentum via the Bardeen-Petterson effect, gradually increasing \\(a\\) toward unity as prolonged inflow adds aligned angular momentum. In contrast, mergers with randomly oriented partners tend to randomize or even flip the spin direction, with the final \\(a\\) depending on the progenitors' masses, spins, and orbital configuration, often resulting in moderate spins (\\(a \\sim 0.3-0.7\\)) for chaotic growth histories.\n\n### Evaporation and final stages\n\nIn 1974, Stephen Hawking proposed that black holes are not entirely black but emit radiation due to quantum mechanical effects near their event horizons. This process, known as Hawking radiation, arises from quantum fluctuations in the vacuum, where particle-antiparticle pairs form close to the horizon; if one particle falls into the black hole while the other escapes, the escaping particle carries positive energy away, effectively reducing the black hole's mass. The radiation has a thermal spectrum characterized by a blackbody temperature inversely proportional to the black hole's mass.\n\nThe Hawking temperature \\( T \\) is given by\n\n\\[\nT = \\frac{\\hbar c^3}{8 \\pi G M k_B},\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( \\hbar \\) is the reduced Planck constant, \\( c \\) is the speed of light, \\( G \\) is the gravitational constant, \\( M \\) is the black hole mass, and \\( k_B \\) is Boltzmann's constant. For a solar-mass black hole, this temperature is approximately 60 nanokelvin, far below the cosmic microwave background and thus negligible for observable effects.\n\nThe evaporation timescale \\( \\\tau \\) scales as \\( \\\tau \\propto M^3 \\), leading to extremely long lifetimes for astrophysical black holes; a stellar-mass black hole of about 10 solar masses would take more than \\( 10^{67} \\) years to evaporate completely, vastly exceeding the current age of the universe. In contrast, hypothetical primordial black holes formed in the early universe with masses around \\( 10^{12} \\) kg could evaporate within the observable universe's lifetime of about 14 billion years, potentially producing detectable gamma-ray bursts in their final moments.\n\nAs evaporation proceeds, the black hole's mass decreases, causing its temperature to rise and the radiation rate to accelerate dramatically in the final stages. This could culminate in a high-energy burst, akin to an explosion, or leave behind a stable remnant at the Planck scale where quantum gravity effects halt further evaporation. The mechanism shares an analogy with the Unruh effect, where an accelerating observer perceives the quantum vacuum as thermal radiation; similarly, the near-horizon spacetime curvature induces a thermal bath for infalling observers, contributing to the emitted spectrum.\n\n## Observational evidence\n\n### Gravitational wave detections\n\nThe first direct detection of gravitational waves from a black hole merger was GW150914, observed by the Advanced LIGO detectors on September 14, 2015, and announced on February 11, 2016. This event involved the coalescence of two black holes with masses of approximately 36 M⊙ and 29 M⊙, producing a final merged black hole of about 62 M⊙ and releasing energy equivalent to 3 M⊙ in gravitational waves. The signal was detected with a combined signal-to-noise ratio of 24, confirming the existence of binary black hole systems and providing the first evidence for stellar-mass black holes in the predicted mass range.\n\nThe detected waveform of GW150914 consisted of three distinct phases: the inspiral, where the black holes orbited each other in gradually tightening spirals; the merger, marking the collision; and the ringdown, where the distorted final black hole settled into a stable Kerr configuration. Numerical relativity simulations matched the observed signal to predictions from general relativity for non-spinning Kerr black holes, with the ringdown phase specifically aligning with quasi-normal mode frequencies expected for a spinning black hole remnant. This agreement validated the Kerr metric description for the post-merger black hole and ruled out alternative models without such perturbations.\n\nBy August 2025, the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaborations had cataloged 218 confident gravitational wave events in GWTC-4, primarily from binary black hole mergers during the first three observing runs (O1–O3) and the extended O4 run, with additional candidates bringing the total to over 300. Among these, several events involved neutron star-black hole mergers, such as GW200105 and GW200115, which provided insights into mixed compact object systems and constrained the equation of state for neutron stars. The catalog's diversity, including events up to intermediate masses around 150 M⊙, has enabled statistical analyses of black hole populations.\n\nThe mass and spin distributions from these detections impose constraints on black hole formation channels, favoring stellar evolution models with low metallicities for the lower-mass end and hierarchical mergers or pair-instability supernovae gaps for higher masses. For instance, the observed spin magnitudes, often below 0.7, suggest formation via isolated binary evolution rather than dynamical capture in clusters, while the lack of low-mass events limits primordial black hole contributions to less than 1% of the dark matter density. These distributions also probe cosmic merger rates, estimated at 20–100 Gpc⁻³ yr⁻¹ for binary black holes, informing galaxy evolution models.\n\nThe discovery of GW150914 and subsequent detections earned the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics for Rainer Weiss, Barry C. Barish, and Kip S. Thorne, recognizing their foundational contributions to the LIGO detector's design and the observation of gravitational waves. Looking ahead, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), planned for launch in the 2030s, will target gravitational waves from supermassive black hole mergers with masses 10⁴–10⁹ M⊙, enabling multi-messenger studies of galaxy centers at low frequencies inaccessible to ground-based detectors.\n\n### Direct imaging of black holes\n\nThe Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaboration achieved the first direct images of black hole shadows through global very long baseline interferometry at 1.3 mm wavelength, enabling resolution of event-horizon-scale structures by synchronizing radio telescopes as a virtual Earth-sized array. These observations capture the dark shadow cast by the event horizon against the glowing ring of emission from hot plasma in the surrounding accretion disk, providing visual confirmation of general relativity's predictions for supermassive black holes.\n\nIn 2019, the EHT released the inaugural image of M87*, the 6.5 billion solar mass black hole at the center of the Messier 87 galaxy, depicting a lopsided bright ring approximately 42 microarcseconds in diameter encircling a central shadow. This ring structure corresponds to light bent by the black hole's gravity near the photon sphere, the unstable orbit where photons can circle the event horizon. The imaged shadow diameter aligns with general relativity expectations of about 5.5 times the Schwarzschild radius \\( r_s = 2GM/c^2 \\), where \\( G \\) is the gravitational constant, \\( M \\) is the black hole mass, and \\( c \\) is the speed of light, offering a benchmark to test deviations from Einstein's theory in alternative gravity models.\n\nBuilding on this success, the EHT captured the first image of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), the 4 million solar mass supermassive black hole at the Milky Way's galactic center, in 2022, revealing a similarly ring-like shadow but with pronounced asymmetry due to relativistic Doppler boosting from the rapid orbital motion of accreting gas. The observed ring diameter of about 51 microarcseconds again measures roughly 5.5 \\( r_s \\), corroborating the black hole's mass estimate from independent stellar dynamics and reinforcing general relativity while constraining exotic physics that might alter the shadow profile. Polarimetric imaging upgrades in 2024 further resolved linearly polarized emission around Sgr A*, unveiling twisted, strong magnetic fields threading the emission ring near the horizon, consistent with theoretical models of magnetized accretion flows that power black hole jets.\n\nIn September 2025, the EHT released new multi-year observations of M87*, revealing unexpected flips in polarization patterns between 2017, 2018, and 2021, indicating dynamic spiraling magnetic fields near the event horizon and a wobbling jet structure. These findings, combining imaging at 1.3 mm and 0.87 mm wavelengths, demonstrate the evolving environment around the black hole and provide further tests of general relativity in strong-field regimes.\n\nEHT imaging confronts significant technical hurdles, including the sparse distribution of telescopes, which results in incomplete coverage of the Fourier (u-v) plane and necessitates advanced reconstruction algorithms to fill gaps in visibility data. Atmospheric turbulence at millimeter wavelengths introduces phase errors that decorrelate signals over long baselines, demanding precise calibration and error modeling to achieve reliable images. The next-generation Event Horizon Telescope (ngEHT) addresses these limitations by incorporating additional stations, broader frequency coverage up to 0.87 mm, and real-time dynamic imaging capabilities, promising videos of black hole accretion and enhanced tests of gravitational theories.\n\n### Orbital dynamics of nearby objects\n\nThe orbital dynamics of stars and gas clouds in the vicinity of supermassive black holes provide key evidence for their masses and gravitational influence, particularly in the Galactic Center where Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) resides. One of the most precise measurements comes from the S2 star, a B0V-type star orbiting Sgr A* in a highly elliptical path with a period of approximately 16 years. During its 2018 pericenter passage, S2 approached within 120 AU of Sgr A*, reaching speeds of about 7,700 km/s, which allowed detailed astrometric and spectroscopic observations to confirm the black hole's mass at 4.3 million solar masses. These observations, conducted using the GRAVITY instrument on the Very Large Telescope (VLT), refined the orbital parameters and demonstrated deviations from purely Keplerian motion due to general relativistic effects, such as a small precession in the orbit.\n\nGas clouds and structures in the Galactic Center also serve as dynamical tracers, revealing the gravitational potential dominated by Sgr A*. Ionized gas in the mini-spiral arms and the circumnuclear disk (CND) exhibits rotational velocities that align with Keplerian orbits around a central mass of approximately 4 million solar masses, extending the stellar-based estimates to larger scales. The Fermi Bubbles, vast gamma-ray emitting structures extending tens of kiloparsecs from the Galactic plane, are linked to past energetic outflows possibly driven by Sgr A*'s activity, with embedded gas clouds showing kinematic signatures consistent with disruption and acceleration by the black hole's gravity over millions of years. These tracers complement stellar data by probing diffuse material that responds to the black hole's influence without being fully accreted.\n\nFlares observed near Sgr A* further highlight the dynamical interactions, with evidence suggesting tidal disruptions of low-mass stars. In particular, X-ray and infrared flares may arise from partial tidal disruptions of M dwarfs or brown dwarfs passing close to the event horizon, where tidal forces strip outer layers and produce luminous outbursts without full destruction. Such events provide snapshots of orbital close encounters, with models indicating that stars on highly eccentric orbits can repeatedly graze the black hole, contributing to its low-level activity while preserving the overall stellar population dynamics.\n\nMulti-wavelength observations from ground-based telescopes have been crucial for tracking these motions over decades. The VLT's GRAVITY and SINFONI instruments, combined with the Keck Observatory's adaptive optics systems like NIRC2 and OSIRIS, enable precise measurements of proper motions and radial velocities for dozens of stars within the central parsec, achieving astrometric accuracies of milliarcseconds. These long-term campaigns, spanning infrared to near-infrared wavelengths, resolve the crowded field and confirm coherent orbital families around Sgr A*, ruling out alternative mass distributions like distributed dark matter.\n\nSimilar dynamical techniques extend to other environments, offering implications for intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) in globular clusters. In clusters like Omega Centauri and NGC 6624, velocity dispersions and orbital anomalies of stars and pulsars suggest central IMBHs with masses between 10^3 and 10^5 solar masses, inferred from elevated proper motions and mass-to-light ratios inconsistent with stellar remnants alone. For instance, pulsar timing in NGC 6624 indicates an orbiting companion around a potential IMBH exceeding 7,500 solar masses, highlighting how black hole-induced dynamics can segregate and accelerate stars in dense stellar systems. These findings underscore the role of orbital tracing in identifying elusive IMBHs, which may form through repeated mergers in cluster cores.\n\n### Emission from accreting matter\n\nWhen matter accretes onto a black hole, it forms a disk where gravitational potential energy is converted into thermal energy through viscous dissipation, leading to radiative emission primarily in X-rays. This process is highly efficient, with up to 40% of the rest mass energy released for rapidly spinning black holes, contributing significantly to black hole growth. The emission spectrum depends on the accretion flow geometry, including thin disks for high accretion rates and hot, optically thin flows for low rates.\n\nIn stellar-mass black hole X-ray binaries, such as Cygnus X-1 and GRO J1655-40, the compact object accretes from a companion star, producing intense X-ray emission. Cygnus X-1, the first confirmed black hole candidate with a mass of about 15 solar masses, exhibits variability on timescales from milliseconds to days. GRO J1655-40, a microquasar with a 5.4 solar mass black hole, shows relativistic jets and high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) at 300–450 Hz, interpreted as orbital resonances near the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO). These QPOs provide probes of the black hole spin and ISCO radius, with frequencies scaling inversely with black hole mass.\n\nX-ray binaries display distinct spectral states: the soft state dominated by thermal emission from the inner accretion disk at ~1 keV, and the hard state featuring a power-law spectrum from Comptonization in a hot corona above the disk, with photon index Γ ≈ 1.7. Relativistic reflection from the disk imprints broad iron Kα lines at ~6.4 keV, broadened by Doppler and gravitational redshift, allowing spin measurements. Transitions between states occur as accretion rates vary, with jets prominent in the hard state.\n\nFor supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei (AGN) and quasars, accretion produces luminous emission across the spectrum, with broad-line regions (BLRs) of ionized gas orbiting at ~0.1 parsec, reprocessing UV/optical continuum into broad emission lines like Hβ. Relativistic jets in radio-loud AGN, such as those in quasars, are powered by the Blandford-Znajek process, extracting rotational energy from the spinning black hole via twisted magnetic fields threading the ergosphere, achieving efficiencies up to 100% of the black hole's spin energy.\n\nObservations by Chandra and XMM-Newton have resolved these features in stellar-mass systems; for instance, XMM-Newton spectra of Cygnus X-1 reveal variable iron lines and coronal properties during state transitions. Chandra's high-resolution imaging detects outflows in binaries like GRO J1655-40, tracing disk winds.\n\nAccretion-driven outflows and jets in AGN provide feedback, expelling gas at velocities up to 0.1c and heating the interstellar medium, thereby suppressing star formation in host galaxies and regulating black hole growth. This feedback balances accretion, maintaining observed black hole-galaxy correlations.\n\n### Gravitational lensing effects\n\nGravitational lensing occurs when the immense gravity of a black hole bends the path of light from distant sources, acting as a natural telescope that magnifies and distorts background objects. For black holes, this effect arises because photons follow null geodesics that curve around the photon sphere, the unstable orbit at 1.5 times the event horizon radius. This passive phenomenon allows detection of isolated black holes without relying on electromagnetic emission, providing insights into their distribution and masses.\n\nIn strong lensing regimes, supermassive black holes in foreground galaxies can produce dramatic distortions of background quasars, including Einstein rings—circular images formed when the lens, source, and observer are perfectly aligned. A classic example is the system JVAS B1938+666, where an early-type galaxy at redshift z=0.881, hosting a supermassive black hole, lenses a background quasar into a complete infrared Einstein ring with an angular diameter of about 1 arcsecond. Such rings enable precise measurements of the lensing mass within the Einstein radius, which for B1938+666 is approximately 10^{10.3} solar masses, offering constraints on black hole-galaxy co-evolution. Recent analyses of eight strongly lensed quasars, including systems like DES J0408-5354, further probe supermassive black hole masses by comparing lensing-derived host galaxy masses to black hole scaling relations, revealing alignments with local correlations up to z≈2.\n\nMicrolensing, a subset of strong lensing, detects stellar-mass black holes by their temporary magnification of background stars as they pass in front, without resolving the lens itself. Surveys like the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) and Microlensing Observations in Astrophysics (MOA) monitor millions of stars in the Galactic bulge and Magellanic Clouds for these short-duration events (days to months). A landmark detection is the event OGLE-2011-BLG-0462 (also MOA-2011-BLG-191), identified in 2011 and confirmed in 2022 as an isolated 7.1 ± 1.3 solar mass black hole at about 5 kpc distance, through combined photometric light curves showing Earth's parallactic motion and Hubble Space Telescope astrometry resolving the lens-source separation. These surveys have identified over a dozen black hole candidates, estimating their Galactic population fraction at around 1-2% of stellar remnants.\n\nFor low-mass primordial black holes (PBHs) with masses ≲10^{-10} solar masses, wave optics effects become prominent in microlensing because the Schwarzschild radius approaches optical wavelengths, causing interference patterns in the light curve rather than simple geometric magnification. These oscillations, akin to diffraction, can serve as a signature distinguishing PBHs from point-like lenses and alter the expected event rate. Analysis of Subaru Telescope monitoring of M31 stars shows that while finite source size effects dominate constraints for PBHs around 10^{-11} to 10^{-10} solar masses, incorporating wave optics slightly relaxes abundance limits to f_PBH \\u003c 0.04 in the 10^{-11} solar mass range, highlighting the need for high-cadence observations to probe this regime.\n\nIn lensed images, the black hole shadow—a dark region of diameter about 5.2 times the event horizon—can be microlensed by intervening compact objects, producing unique caustics and distortions that differ from stellar lensing. Detailed simulations of Event Horizon Telescope-like observations reveal that microlensing of the shadow by stellar-mass black holes creates asymmetric brightness variations and substructure within the shadow boundary, allowing differentiation from stars, which lack an extended dark core and instead produce symmetric point-source magnification. This effect provides a method to identify isolated black holes in dense fields, with detectable signatures for impact parameters under 10 Schwarzschild radii.\n\nThe Gaia mission constrains isolated black holes through astrometric microlensing, measuring tiny positional shifts (microarcseconds) in background stars caused by the lens's gravity. Population synthesis models predict Gaia could detect 30–300 such events over its lifetime, primarily systems with orbital periods under 10 years and black hole masses ≥3 solar masses, after accounting for interstellar extinction. Early data releases have set upper limits on the density of isolated stellar-mass black holes in the solar neighborhood at less than 10^{-5} pc^{-3}, with future releases expected to refine these to masses as low as 2 solar masses via photocenter wobbles.\n\n## Theoretical challenges\n\n### Alternative models to black holes\n\nOne prominent alternative to the classical black hole model is the gravastar, proposed as a horizonless configuration that avoids both event horizons and singularities. In this model, the interior consists of a de Sitter spacetime representing a gravitational vacuum condensate, analogous to a Bose-Einstein condensate, surrounded by a thin shell of matter that mimics the appearance of an event horizon from the outside. The gravastar structure emerges as the stable endpoint of gravitational collapse, where quantum effects prevent the formation of a singularity by distributing mass in a compact, nearly horizon-like shell.\n\nAnother string theory-inspired proposal is the fuzzball model, which replaces the black hole interior with a horizonless, highly quantum configuration of tangled fundamental strings. Developed within the framework of type IIB string theory with compact extra dimensions, such as toroidal compactifications, fuzzballs resolve the singularity by describing the black hole as a smooth, \"fuzzy\" ball of strings whose quantum states encode the black hole's entropy without a true event horizon. This approach suggests that the classical black hole geometry breaks down at the Planck scale, with the fuzzball's surface fluctuating rapidly to produce Hawking-like radiation through stringy effects.\n\nThe black hole firewall hypothesis offers a radical modification to the smooth event horizon predicted by general relativity, positing instead a high-energy barrier of particles and radiation at or just inside the horizon. Introduced by Almheiri, Marolf, Polchinski, and Sully (AMPS), this model arises from tensions in quantum field theory on curved spacetimes, where preserving unitarity in Hawking radiation leads to a violation of the equivalence principle for infalling observers, who would encounter an immense flux of energy akin to a \"wall of fire.\" Firewalls challenge the no-drama crossing of horizons in semiclassical gravity, suggesting that quantum corrections dramatically alter the near-horizon region for evaporating black holes.\n\nExotic compact objects (ECOs) encompass a broader class of horizonless alternatives, including boson stars and traversable wormholes, which can replicate many black hole observables while avoiding singularities. Boson stars are self-gravitating solitons formed from scalar fields, such as axions, that concentrate into compact configurations with radii approaching the Schwarzschild limit but without collapsing due to quantum pressure. Wormholes, stabilized by exotic matter or quantum effects, connect distant regions of spacetime and could mimic black hole shadows or accretion disks externally. These ECOs predict distinctive signatures, such as repeated \"echoes\" in gravitational wave signals from mergers, arising from waves reflecting off the compact surface rather than ringing down exponentially.\n\nObservational tests of these alternatives leverage deviations from general relativity predictions in black hole imaging and gravitational wave detections. The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) images of supermassive black hole shadows, such as those of M87* and Sgr A*, constrain ECO models by measuring shadow sizes and edge brightness; for instance, gravastars or fuzzballs with thin shells could produce brighter or distorted rings compared to Kerr black holes, though current EHT data align closely with general relativity within uncertainties. In gravitational wave ringdown phases from LIGO/Virgo detections, ECOs might exhibit anomalous echoes delayed by milliseconds, providing bounds on the compactness and reflectivity of alternative objects; analyses of events like GW150914 have set limits excluding highly reflective ECOs at high confidence but leave room for subtle quantum modifications.\n\n### Information loss paradox\n\nThe black hole information paradox arises from the apparent conflict between quantum mechanics and general relativity during black hole evaporation. In 1976, Stephen Hawking proposed that quantum effects near the event horizon lead to the emission of thermal radiation, causing the black hole to evaporate over time. However, this process would transform the initial pure quantum state of infalling matter into a mixed state in the outgoing radiation, violating the principle of unitarity in quantum mechanics, which requires information to be preserved. This loss of information challenges the predictability of quantum evolution, as the final state of the radiation would not uniquely determine the initial conditions.\n\nTo address this issue, Leonard Susskind introduced the principle of black hole complementarity in 1993, suggesting that different observers experience complementary but mutually inconsistent descriptions of events near the horizon. For a distant observer, the information is encoded on a \"stretched horizon\" just outside the event horizon, preserving unitarity in the exterior description, while an infalling observer sees no such barrier and experiences smooth passage through the horizon. This observer-dependent framework aims to reconcile the paradox without violating quantum mechanics or general relativity for any single observer.\n\nProposals based on the AdS/CFT correspondence offer a holographic resolution, where the quantum gravity dynamics inside an anti-de Sitter (AdS) black hole are mapped to a unitary conformal field theory (CFT) on the boundary without information loss. In this duality, the black hole interior and its evaporation are encoded in the boundary CFT's entanglement structure, ensuring that the radiation's entropy follows a unitary evolution. Recent calculations using this framework, such as those incorporating quantum extremal surfaces, demonstrate how information is recovered through subtle correlations in the radiation.\n\nSignificant progress came in 2019–2020 with computations of the Page curve, which describes the entanglement entropy of Hawking radiation as a function of time. Using the replica trick and gravitational path integrals, researchers found that \"replica wormholes\" contribute to the entropy calculation, leading to the emergence of \"entanglement islands\" inside the black hole that restore unitarity after the Page time (when half the black hole has evaporated). These islands effectively include interior regions in the radiation's quantum description, causing the entropy to decrease and match the expected unitary behavior, thus resolving the paradox in specific holographic models.\n\nThe ER=EPR conjecture, proposed by Juan Maldacena and Leonard Susskind in 2013, further links the paradox to quantum entanglement by equating Einstein-Rosen (ER) wormholes with Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) entangled pairs. This suggests that the interior connections in black holes arise from entanglement, providing a geometric interpretation where information is preserved through traversable wormhole-like structures in the quantum gravity description. Such ideas support the holographic resolutions by unifying spacetime geometry with quantum correlations. As of 2025, while significant progress has been made in toy models via holography, the paradox remains unresolved in a complete theory of quantum gravity, with ongoing research exploring quantum correlations in spacetime and other mechanisms.\n\n### Black hole thermodynamics and entropy\n\nIn the 1970s, physicists recognized striking analogies between the behavior of black holes in general relativity and the laws of thermodynamics, leading to the field of black hole thermodynamics. This framework treats black holes as thermodynamic systems where mass corresponds to internal energy, surface gravity to temperature, and event horizon area to entropy. The zeroth law states that the surface gravity \\(\\kappa\\), analogous to temperature, is constant over the event horizon for stationary black holes. The first law, \\(dM = \\frac{\\kappa}{8\\pi} dA + \\Omega dJ\\), relates infinitesimal changes in mass \\(M\\) to changes in horizon area \\(A\\), angular velocity \\(\\Omega\\), and angular momentum \\(J\\), mirroring the conservation of energy in thermodynamics. The second law asserts that the horizon area never decreases for classical processes, ensuring an irreversible increase akin to entropy growth. The third law equates the no-hair theorem—stating that stationary black holes are fully described by mass, charge, and spin—with unattainability of absolute zero temperature, as extremal black holes have vanishing surface gravity.\n\nJacob Bekenstein proposed that black holes possess entropy proportional to their horizon area to resolve paradoxes in the second law, arguing that collapsing matter increases total entropy via the black hole's contribution. Stephen Hawking later derived the precise Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula, \\(S = \\frac{A}{4 \\hbar G / c^3}\\), where \\(A = 4\\pi r_s^2\\) for a Schwarzschild black hole with Schwarzschild radius \\(r_s = 2GM/c^2\\), interpreting it as the logarithm of the number of microstates consistent with the black hole's macroscopic parameters. This entropy scales with area rather than volume, challenging conventional thermodynamic expectations and suggesting black holes store information holographically on their boundaries.\n\nHawking's semiclassical calculation of quantum fields near the horizon revealed that black holes emit thermal radiation at temperature \\(T_H = \\frac{\\hbar c^3}{8\\pi G M k_B}\\), derived from the periodicity in imaginary time imposed by the horizon's geometry to avoid conical singularities in the Euclidean path integral. This Hawking temperature links directly to evaporation: the black hole loses mass via radiation, with power \\(P \\propto \\frac{\\hbar c^6}{G^2 M^2}\\), causing the horizon area to decrease over time until potential complete evaporation, though classical area theorems prohibit this without quantum effects.\n\nThe holographic principle, proposed by Gerard 't Hooft and elaborated by Leonard Susskind, posits that black hole entropy arises from degrees of freedom on a boundary surface rather than the bulk volume, with the entropy bounded by \\(S \\leq \\frac{A}{4 \\ell_p^2}\\) where \\(\\ell_p = \\sqrt{\\hbar G / c^3}\\) is the Planck length. This principle implies that a theory of quantum gravity in \\(d\\) dimensions can be encoded in a \\((d-1)\\)-dimensional boundary theory, resolving the apparent mismatch between black hole microstates and gravitational entropy.\n\nIn the 2020s, advances in quantum gravity via the AdS/CFT correspondence introduced \"entanglement islands\" to refine entropy calculations for evaporating black holes. These islands are regions behind the horizon whose entanglement with radiation contributes to the fine-grained entropy, ensuring the Page curve—where entropy rises then falls to preserve unitarity—via replica wormhole saddles in the gravitational path integral. This resolves discrepancies in Hawking's original thermal description while upholding the Bekenstein-Hawking formula in the semiclassical limit.",
