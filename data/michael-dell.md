## Overview

Michael Saul Dell (born February 23, 1965) is an American billionaire businessman, philanthropist, and the founder, chairman, and CEO of Dell Technologies, one of the world's leading technology companies. Known for revolutionizing the personal computer industry through a direct-to-consumer business model, Dell has played a pivotal role in making computing accessible and affordable to millions. As of 2023, he is among the wealthiest individuals globally, with a net worth estimated at over $90 billion, according to *Forbes* [Forbes Profile](https://www.forbes.com/profile/michael-dell/). Beyond his business achievements, Dell is also recognized for his philanthropy, focusing on education, health, and economic opportunity through the Michael & Susan Dell Foundation.

## Early Life and Historical Background

Michael Dell was born in Houston, Texas, to a Jewish family. His father, Alexander Dell, was an orthodontist, and his mother, Lorraine Charlotte, was a stockbroker. From a young age, Dell showed an entrepreneurial spirit. At 12, he earned $2,000 by selling newspaper subscriptions, using the money to invest in stocks and precious metals [Biography.com](https://www.biography.com/business-leaders/michael-dell). His early fascination with technology emerged during high school when he purchased an Apple II computer and disassembled it to understand its workings.

Dell enrolled at the University of Texas at Austin in 1983 with plans to study medicine. However, his passion for technology led him to start a side business upgrading and selling personal computers from his dorm room. In 1984, at the age of 19, he founded PC's Limited with just $1,000 in capital. The company focused on selling customized computers directly to customers, bypassing traditional retail channels. This direct model allowed for lower costs and better customer feedback, setting the stage for rapid growth [Dell Technologies History](https://www.dell.com/en-us/dt/corporate/about-us/who-we-are.htm). By 1988, the company was renamed Dell Computer Corporation and went public, raising $30 million and valuing the firm at $85 million.

Under Dell's leadership, the company became a global leader in personal computing during the 1990s, capitalizing on the internet boom to sell directly to consumers online. By 2001, Dell Inc. surpassed Compaq to become the world's largest PC manufacturer [CNN Business](https://money.cnn.com/2001/07/19/technology/dell/).

## Career Milestones and Challenges

Dell's innovative business model, often referred to as the "Dell Direct Model," emphasized build-to-order manufacturing, just-in-time inventory, and direct customer relationships. This approach not only reduced costs but also allowed Dell to adapt quickly to market demands. By the mid-2000s, however, the company faced challenges as competitors adopted similar strategies and the PC market became saturated. In 2007, Michael Dell stepped down as CEO but returned in 2007 to steer the company through a period of declining market share and financial struggles [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-dell-ceo-idUSTRE50U1Q820090131).

In 2013, Dell led a historic $24.4 billion buyout to take the company private, partnering with Silver Lake Partners. This move allowed Dell to restructure away from public market pressures, focusing on enterprise solutions and cloud computing rather than solely PCs [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-10-29/dell-officially-goes-private-in-24-9-billion-buyout). In 2016, Dell Technologies was formed following a $67 billion merger with EMC Corporation, creating one of the largest technology infrastructure companies in the world [Dell EMC Merger](https://www.delltechnologies.com/en-us/blog/dell-emc-merger-one-year-later/). The company returned to public markets in 2018 through a complex financial maneuver involving its VMware subsidiary.
