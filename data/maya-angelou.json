Best known for her groundbreaking autobiography *I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings* (1969), Angelou explored themes of identity, racism, and resilience through her writing. Her career spanned multiple disciplines, including acting, singing, and directing, making her a multifaceted cultural icon. Angelou's contributions to literature and activism earned her numerous accolades, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2011 [Biography.com](https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/maya-angelou).\n\n## Historical Background\nMaya Angelou was born in St. Louis, Missouri, during a time of deep racial segregation in the United States. After her parents' divorce, she and her brother were sent to live with their grandmother in Stamps, Arkansas, a small, segregated town. At the age of eight, Angelou suffered a traumatic assault by her mother's boyfriend, an event that led to a period of muteness lasting nearly five years. This experience profoundly shaped her perspective and later became a central theme in *I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings* [History.com](https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/maya-angelou).\n\nIn the 1940s, Angelou moved to San Francisco with her mother, where she became the first Black female streetcar conductor at the age of 16. Her early adulthood was marked by a series of diverse roles, including dancer, singer, and actress. She toured Europe in the 1950s as part of a production of *Porgy and Bess* and later joined the civil rights movement, working alongside figures like Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X. During the 1960s, she lived in Africa, working as a journalist and educator in Egypt and Ghana [Poetry Foundation](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/maya-angelou).\n\nAngelou's literary career began to flourish with the publication of her first autobiography in 1969, which brought her international recognition. She went on to write six more autobiographical works, as well as numerous volumes of poetry, essays, and plays. Her work often addressed systemic racism, personal trauma, and the strength of the human spirit, resonating with readers across generations [Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Maya-Angelou).\n\n## Current Status and Relevance\nAlthough Maya Angelou passed away on May 28, 2014, at the age of 86 in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, her legacy endures through her extensive body of work and her impact on civil rights and literature. Her writings continue to be studied in schools and universities worldwide, often cited as essential reading for understanding the African American experience. *I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings* remains a staple in curricula, despite occasional challenges due to its candid discussion of trauma and race [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2014/05/28/316724922/maya-angelou-poet-activist-and-singular-storyteller-dies-at-86).\n\nAngelou's influence extends beyond literature into popular culture and social justice advocacy.
