Roosevelt\n\n## Overview\n\nFranklin Delano Roosevelt, commonly known as FDR, was the 32nd President of the United States, serving from 1933 to 1945. He is the only U.S. president to have been elected to four terms, leading the nation through two of the most significant crises of the 20th century: the Great Depression and World War II. Roosevelt's presidency is often defined by his New Deal programs, which aimed to provide economic relief, recovery, and reform, and his leadership during wartime, which helped shape the modern global order. A member of the Democratic Party, FDR is widely regarded as one of the most influential presidents in American history, leaving a lasting impact on domestic policy and international relations [Biography.com](https://www.biography.com/political-figures/franklin-d-roosevelt).\n\n## Early Life and Historical Background\n\nFranklin D. Roosevelt was born on January 30, 1882, in Hyde Park, New York, into a wealthy and prominent family. He was a distant cousin of Theodore Roosevelt, the 26th U.S. President, and grew up with privileges that included private tutoring and education at elite institutions like Harvard University and Columbia Law School. Roosevelt married Eleanor Roosevelt, his fifth cousin once removed, in 1905, and the couple had six children [History.com](https://www.history.com/topics/us-presidents/franklin-d-roosevelt).\n\nBefore entering national politics, Roosevelt served as a New York State Senator (1911–1913) and as Assistant Secretary of the Navy (1913–1920) under President Woodrow Wilson. In 1921, at the age of 39, he was struck by polio, which left him paralyzed from the waist down. Despite this personal setback, Roosevelt adapted to his disability, using leg braces and a wheelchair, though he often concealed the extent of his condition from the public to maintain an image of strength [National Park Service](https://www.nps.gov/frde/learn/historyculture/fdr-and-polio.htm).\n\nRoosevelt's political career continued to rise as he was elected Governor of New York in 1928. His progressive policies and ability to connect with ordinary citizens through radio broadcasts, later known as \"fireside chats,\" positioned him as a leading Democratic figure during a time of economic hardship [Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Franklin-D-Roosevelt).\n\n## Presidency and Key Policies\n\n### The New Deal and the Great Depression\nRoosevelt assumed the presidency on March 4, 1933, amid the depths of the Great Depression, with millions of Americans unemployed and the banking system on the brink of collapse. His inaugural address famously included the line, \"the only thing we have to fear is fear itself,\" signaling his intent to restore confidence [Miller Center](https://millercenter.org/president/fdroosevelt). Within his first 100 days, FDR implemented a series of programs and reforms collectively known as the **New Deal**, aimed at providing relief to the unemployed, recovering the economy, and reforming financial systems. Key initiatives included:\n\n- **The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC)**: Provided jobs for young men in environmental conservation projects.\n- **The Social Security Act (1935)**: Established a system of old-age pensions and unemployment insurance, a cornerstone of modern American social welfare.\n- **The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA)**: Promoted regional development through infrastructure and electrification projects.\n\nWhile the New Deal did not fully end the Depression, it provided critical support to millions and reshaped the role of the federal government in American life [History.com](https://www.history.com/topics/great-depression/new-deal).\n\n### World War II Leadership\nAs tensions rose in Europe and Asia during the late 1930s, Roosevelt initially focused on maintaining American neutrality while providing aid to Allied nations through programs like the Lend-Lease Act. Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, the United States entered World War II. FDR became a central figure in the Allied coalition, working closely with leaders like Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin to strategize against the Axis powers. His administration oversaw the mobilization of the U.S. economy for war production and the deployment of millions of American troops [National WWII Museum](https://www.nationalww2museum.org/students-teachers/student-resources/research-starters/research-starters-president-franklin-d-roosevelt).\n\nRoosevelt also played a key role in planning the post-war world, including the establishment of the United Nations, though he did not live to see its creation. His vision for international cooperation aimed to prevent future global conflicts [United Nations](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/history-of-the-un).\n\n## Death and Current Status/Relevance\n\nFranklin D. Roosevelt died on April 12, 1945, of a cerebral hemorrhage while at his retreat in Warm Springs, Georgia, just months into his fourth term. His death came before the end of World War II, and Vice President Harry S. Truman succeeded him. FDR's legacy remains a subject of both admiration and debate. His New Deal policies fundamentally transformed the U.S. government’s role in economic and social welfare, while his wartime leadership helped secure victory for the Allies. However, critics have pointed to policies such as the internment of Japanese Americans during WWII as significant moral failings [Smithsonian Magazine](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/internment-japanese-americans-during-world-war-ii-180964688/).\n\nToday, Roosevelt is frequently ranked among the greatest U.S. presidents in historical surveys, alongside figures like Abraham Lincoln and George Washington. His image appears on the U.S. dime, and numerous memorials, including the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial in Washington, D.C., commemorate his contributions [National Park Service](https://www.nps.gov/frde/index.htm).\n\n## Notable Facts and Details\n\n- **Four-Term Presidency**: Roosevelt’s unprecedented four terms led to the passage of the 22nd Amendment in 1951, limiting presidents to two terms [Constitution Center](https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendment/amendment-xxii).\n- **Fireside Chats**: FDR pioneered the use of radio to communicate directly with the American public, delivering over 30 informal addresses to explain policies and reassure citizens during crises [PBS](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/fdr-fireside-chats/).\n- **Disability and Public Perception**: Despite his paralysis, Roosevelt carefully managed public appearances to downplay his disability, often being photographed standing with support or seated [National Park Service](https://www.nps.gov/frde/learn/historyculture/fdr-and-polio.htm).\n- **Yalta Conference**: In February 1945, FDR met with Churchill and Stalin at Yalta to discuss post-war reorganization, a pivotal moment in shaping the Cold War era [History.com](https://www.history.com/topics/world-war-ii/yalta-conference).\n\n## Related Topics\n\n- **The New Deal**: A series of programs and reforms aimed at economic recovery during the Great Depression.\n- **World War II**: The global conflict during which Roosevelt led the U.S. as a key Allied power.\n- **Eleanor Roosevelt**: FDR’s wife and a prominent activist who played a significant role in social reform and human rights advocacy.\n- **Great Depression**: The severe economic downturn that shaped Roosevelt’s early presidency.\n- **United Nations**: An international organization Roosevelt helped conceptualize to promote global peace.\n\n## References\n\n- [Franklin D.
