## Historical Background
The University of Cambridge was founded in 1209 by scholars who left the University of Oxford after a dispute with local townsfolk. This makes it the second-oldest university in the English-speaking world, after Oxford. The two institutions, often collectively referred to as "Oxbridge," share a long history of rivalry and academic excellence. Cambridge received its royal charter in 1231 from King Henry III, granting it legal recognition and certain privileges [BBC History - University of Cambridge](https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/cambridge_university.shtml).

Throughout the Middle Ages, Cambridge played a central role in the intellectual and religious life of Europe. It was a hub for theological studies, and many of its early colleges, such as Peterhouse (founded in 1284), were established by religious figures. The university's growth continued during the Renaissance and the Enlightenment, with significant contributions to science and mathematics, most notably through the work of Sir Isaac Newton, who studied and taught at Trinity College in the late 17th century [Encyclopaedia Britannica - University of Cambridge](https://www.britannica.com/topic/University-of-Cambridge).

The 19th and 20th centuries saw Cambridge embrace modernity, expanding its curriculum to include natural sciences, engineering, and social sciences. It also became a pioneer in women's education, with the establishment of Girton College in 1869 as the first college for women, though full degrees for women were not awarded until 1948 [Girton College History](https://www.girton.cam.ac.uk/about-girton/history).

## Current Status and Relevance

It consistently ranks among the top five universities worldwide in various rankings, such as the QS World University Rankings and the Times Higher Education World University Rankings [QS World University Rankings 2024](https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2024). The university is home to over 24,000 students, including approximately 12,000 undergraduates and 12,000 postgraduates, representing more than 140 countries [University of Cambridge - About](https://www.cam.ac.uk/about-the-university).

Cambridge is a major center for research, with significant contributions to fields such as physics, biology, and computer science. The university is associated with the development of groundbreaking technologies, including the discovery of the structure of DNA by James Watson and Francis Crick in 1953 at the Cavendish Laboratory [Nature - DNA Discovery](https://www.nature.com/articles/171737a0). It also plays a key role in fostering innovation through initiatives like the Cambridge Science Park, one of the oldest science parks in the world, established in 1970 [Cambridge Science Park](https://www.cambridgesciencepark.co.uk).

The university's collegiate system remains a defining feature, with each of the 31 colleges providing a close-knit community for students and faculty. Colleges are responsible for student housing, welfare, and small-group teaching (known as "supervisions"), while the university oversees degree programs and examinations. Cambridge also maintains a strong commitment to accessibility, offering generous financial aid through bursaries and scholarships [Cambridge Bursary Scheme](https://www.cam.ac.uk/study-at-cambridge/finance-and-funding).
