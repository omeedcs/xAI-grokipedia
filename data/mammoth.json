  "content": "# Mammoth\n\nMammoths (genus *Mammuthus*) are an extinct group of large, herbivorous proboscideans in the family Elephantidae, closely related to modern elephants, that originated in Africa during the Pliocene epoch around 5 million years ago. They subsequently migrated to Eurasia and North America, where they diversified into approximately ten species during the Pleistocene epoch, adapting to a range of environments from forests to tundra. The most iconic species include the woolly mammoth (*M. primigenius*), which inhabited cold northern steppes, and the Columbian mammoth (*M. columbi*), which roamed warmer grasslands in North America.\n\nThese massive herbivores were characterized by their elongated skulls, long curved tusks used for foraging and defense, and high-crowned molars with numerous enamel ridges suited for grinding tough vegetation like grasses and sedges. Cold-adapted species such as the woolly mammoth featured insulating shaggy fur, small ears to minimize heat loss, short tails, and a layer of subcutaneous fat, while others like the steppe mammoth (*M. trogontherii*) had sparser hair. Adult male woolly mammoths typically reached shoulder heights of 2.8 to 3.4 meters and body masses of 4 to 6 metric tons, with exceptional individuals exceeding 3.9 meters in height and 10 metric tons in weight; females were smaller, averaging 2.6 to 2.9 meters tall and 2.8 to 4 metric tons. Tusks in mature males could grow up to 4 meters long and weigh over 100 kilograms each.\n\nMammoths played key ecological roles as ecosystem engineers, shaping landscapes through their grazing and trampling, which promoted grassland diversity. Most species went extinct around 11,500 years ago at the end of the Pleistocene, coinciding with rapid climate warming and the expansion of human hunters, though the exact causes likely involved a combination of environmental changes and overhunting. Isolated island populations survived longer into the Holocene; for instance, dwarfed mammoths persisted on the Channel Islands until about 10,500 years ago, while the last woolly mammoths on Wrangel Island off Siberia died out around 4,000 years ago.\n\n## Naming and Classification\n\n### Etymology\n\nThe term \"mammoth\" entered European languages in the early 17th century, derived from the Russian *mamont* (modern *mamont*), which first appeared in records around 1578 in phrases referring to \"mammoth bone\" or tusks unearthed in Siberia. This Russian form likely stems from indigenous Siberian languages, such as those of the Uralic Mansi people (Proto-Mansi *\\mān-oŋt*, meaning \"earth horn\") or Tungusic groups like the Evenki, reflecting the discovery of long ivory tusks protruding from the permafrost, interpreted as horns emerging from the ground. The word entered English via Dutch *mammut* or *mammuth* in 1706, based on accounts of Siberian explorations, and by the 18th century, it was widely used to describe the large, extinct elephant-like creatures whose frozen remains and bones were increasingly reported by Russian and European travelers.\n\nEarly European observations of mammoth remains in the 17th and 18th centuries were marked by limited understanding and imaginative interpretations. Accounts from Siberian expeditions described intact frozen carcasses, often with flesh and hair preserved, leading to theories that these were tropical elephants transported northward by floods or sudden cataclysms and then flash-frozen. For instance, reports from the 1690s and early 1700s detailed discoveries along Siberian rivers, where locals and explorers noted the animals' shaggy coats and curved tusks, but attributed their preservation to divine intervention or unknown natural forces rather than recognizing extinction. These findings fueled curiosity in Europe, with tusks traded as \"Siberian unicorn horns\" for their supposed medicinal properties, though misconceptions persisted about the animals' habitats and demise.\n\nIn the 19th century, French anatomist Georges Cuvier provided the first scientific clarification, demonstrating through comparative anatomy that mammoth remains represented a distinct species separate from living elephants. In a 1796 presentation, Cuvier analyzed Siberian specimens and European fossils, concluding they belonged to an extinct form he initially classified under *Elephas*, emphasizing anatomical differences like the molars and skull structure that proved the animal's uniqueness and supported the concept of extinction. This work established \"mammoth\" as the common name for the genus *Mammuthus*, shifting perceptions from mythical or relocated beasts to a rigorously defined prehistoric taxon.\n\nCultural variations in naming persisted among indigenous Siberian peoples, who encountered the frozen remains long before European contact and integrated them into oral traditions. For example, Yakut (Sakha) and Evenki communities used terms derived from words for \"tusk\" or \"underground beast,\" often viewing the fossils as remnants of subterranean creatures that shaped the landscape, with tusks symbolizing connections to the earth rather than horns of surface animals. These indigenous designations, such as Evenki *mamont* for the bones or ivory, directly influenced the Russian and broader Eurasian nomenclature, highlighting a pre-scientific recognition of the remains' significance in local ecology and mythology.\n\n### Taxonomy and Species\n\nMammoths are classified within the genus *Mammuthus*, part of the family Elephantidae in the order Proboscidea. This family also includes modern elephants, with *Mammuthus* species most closely related phylogenetically to Asian elephants (*Elephas maximus*), based on both morphological and DNA analyses that position mammoths as a sister group to *Elephas* relative to African elephants (*Loxodonta*). The genus *Mammuthus* originated in Africa during the Pliocene approximately 5 million years ago and diversified across Eurasia and North America during the Pleistocene. The genus comprises approximately ten species.\n\nKey species within *Mammuthus* include the woolly mammoth (*M. primigenius*), adapted to cold steppe-tundra environments; the Columbian mammoth (*M. columbi*), which inhabited warmer grasslands of North America; the steppe mammoth (*M. trogontherii*), a large Eurasian form; and insular dwarf species such as the pygmy mammoth (*M. exilis*) from California's Channel Islands. The steppe mammoth, one of the earliest recognized species, emerged around 1.7 million years ago in eastern Asia from ancestral southern mammoths (*M. meridionalis*). The woolly mammoth evolved later, approximately 400,000 years ago in Siberia, deriving from *M. trogontherii* populations with adaptations for arctic conditions.\n\nPhylogenetic studies reveal complex relationships among *Mammuthus* species, with evidence of hybridization shaping their diversity. Genomic analyses indicate that the Columbian mammoth arose from interbreeding between woolly mammoths and an earlier North American mammoth lineage related to *M. trogontherii*, occurring around 500,000–600,000 years ago during the migration of woolly mammoths across Beringia. Further hybridization persisted between woolly and Columbian mammoths for thousands of years in overlapping ranges, as shown by ancient DNA from fossils in Canada, producing hybrid individuals with mixed traits from both parental species. The pygmy mammoth, in contrast, represents an example of insular dwarfism, descending from *M. columbi* populations isolated on the islands during Marine Isotope Stage 6 or earlier, approximately 150,000–250,000 years ago.\n\n## Evolutionary History\n\n### Origins and Ancestors\n\nMammoths of the genus *Mammuthus* trace their origins to early proboscideans in Africa during the late Miocene to early Pliocene, descending from Gomphotherium-like ancestors within the paraphyletic Gomphotheriidae family, which diversified around 18-17 million years ago. The Elephantidae family, to which *Mammuthus* belongs, diverged from related gomphotheres approximately 13.5 million years ago in the Middle Miocene, with the genus itself emerging around 5-6 million years ago as cooling climates prompted adaptations to open habitats. The oldest known species, *Mammuthus subplanifrons*, appeared in eastern Africa during this period, representing a transitional form with primitive dental features bridging earlier proboscideans and later mammoths. Genetic analyses of ancient DNA further support this timeline, estimating the divergence of *Mammuthus* from the lineage leading to modern Asian elephants (*Elephas maximus*) at approximately 5.8-7.8 million years ago, based on mitochondrial genome comparisons using the American mastodon as an outgroup.\n\nBy the mid-Pliocene, around 3.5 million years ago, early mammoths such as *Mammuthus rumanus* migrated from Africa to Eurasia via the Levant land bridge, marking the initial dispersal out of their ancestral continent and into more temperate regions. This migration coincided with the Miocene-Pliocene transition, during which proboscideans exploited expanding Eurasian land connections formed by tectonic uplift and sea-level changes. For North American colonization, mammoths entered via the Bering land bridge around 1.8 million years ago, though *Mammuthus* lineages primarily radiated from Eurasian stocks.\n\nEnvironmental drivers played a crucial role in these origins and dispersals, as global cooling and increased climate variability during the Pliocene—evidenced by temperature drops of up to 5°C and shifts toward drier conditions—promoted the expansion of C4 grasslands across Africa and Eurasia. This biotic shift, peaking between 5.3 and 2.6 million years ago, favored herbivorous proboscideans like early mammoths, which adapted to graze on emergent savannas and steppes, enabling their spread from forested ancestral habitats into vast open landscapes.\n\n### Diversification and Adaptations\n\nThe genus *Mammuthus* underwent significant diversification during the Pleistocene epoch, with peak species richness occurring in the Middle Pleistocene, approximately 1 million to 100,000 years ago, when over 10 species are recognized across Eurasia, North America, and isolated islands. This radiation followed the initial dispersal of ancestral forms from Africa into Eurasia around 3.5 million years ago, leading to the evolution of distinct lineages adapted to varying paleoenvironments. Genetic analyses of ancient DNA from Early and Middle Pleistocene specimens reveal at least two major Siberian lineages—one ancestral to woolly mammoths (*M. primigenius*) and another contributing to North American forms—highlighting cladogenetic splits driven by geographic isolation and climatic shifts.\n\nRegional variations in mammoth morphology reflect adaptations to continental-scale habitats. In Eurasia, steppe mammoths (*M. trogontherii*) dominated open grasslands, featuring robust builds suited to temperate-to-cold steppes, while woolly mammoths evolved in northern high-latitude tundras with dense fur and compact bodies for thermoregulation. In North America, Columbian mammoths (*M. columbi*) occupied warmer southern parklands and grasslands, descending from Eurasian migrants via the Bering land bridge around 1.5 million years ago, and exhibiting larger frames than their northern counterparts. Island populations demonstrated extreme insular dwarfism: on California's Channel Islands, pygmy mammoths (*M. exilis*), derived from Columbian ancestors, averaged about 1.5 meters at the shoulder and weighed roughly 750 kg, an adaptation to limited resources on isolated landmasses during the Late Pleistocene. Similarly, in the Mediterranean, *Mammuthus creticus* on Crete evolved to pint-sized proportions from mainland stock, representing one of the most pronounced cases of island dwarfism in proboscideans.\n\nMammoths responded to Ice Age conditions through dynamic migration patterns tied to glacial-interglacial cycles, expanding ranges southward during glacial maxima when ice sheets advanced and habitats shifted. Woolly mammoths, for instance, tracked expanding tundra-steppe biomes into central Europe and southern North America, while interbreeding with local forms like Columbian mammoths facilitated gene flow in overlapping zones. Fossil records from the Late Pleistocene indicate repeated recolonizations of deglaciated areas, with populations adjusting to fluctuating vegetation and temperatures over 100,000-year cycles.\n\nFossil evidence documents substantial size variation among mammoths, with the largest specimens, such as steppe mammoths, reaching up to 4.5 meters at the shoulder, consistent with Bergmann's rule whereby endotherms in colder latitudes evolve larger body sizes to conserve heat via reduced surface-area-to-volume ratios. Northern Eurasian forms like *M. trogontherii* exemplified this trend, attaining masses over 10 tonnes in periglacial environments, while southern and insular populations trended smaller to match warmer or resource-scarce conditions.\n\n## Physical Characteristics\n\n### Size and Morphology\n\nMammoths exhibited considerable variation in size across species, with the woolly mammoth (*Mammuthus primigenius*) typically reaching shoulder heights of 2.7 to 3.4 meters in adult males and weighing between 4 and 6 metric tons, comparable to the modern Asian elephant (*Elephas maximus*), which stands about 3 meters at the shoulder and weighs up to 5 tons. Females of the woolly mammoth were smaller, with shoulder heights of 2.3 to 2.9 meters and weights up to 4 tons.\n\nThe skeletal morphology of mammoths was adapted to support their massive body mass, featuring robust limbs with thick, pillar-like bones that provided stability and weight-bearing capacity during locomotion over varied terrains. Their dentition included high-crowned molars composed of numerous enamel ridges, ideal for grinding tough, fibrous vegetation such as grasses and sedges, with these teeth progressively replaced throughout life to accommodate continuous wear. Tusks, elongated upper incisors, were prominently curved and could reach lengths of 4 to 5 meters in large individuals, serving structural roles in the overall morphology.\n\nSexual dimorphism was pronounced in mammoths, with males generally larger in overall body size and possessing longer, thicker tusks—often exceeding 3.5 meters—likely for intraspecific display and combat, while females had shorter tusks averaging 2 to 2.5 meters. Across species, size varied significantly; the Columbian mammoth (*Mammuthus columbi*) was among the largest, attaining shoulder heights up to 4 meters and weights of 8 to 10 tons. In contrast, insular dwarf forms like the pygmy mammoth (*Mammuthus exilis*) from California's Channel Islands were markedly smaller, with shoulder heights of 1.7 to 2 meters and weights around 0.7 to 1.35 tons.\n\n### Specialized Features\n\nThe woolly mammoth exhibited several specialized physiological adaptations that facilitated survival in the harsh, cold Pleistocene environments of the northern hemispheres. Its fur was multi-layered, consisting of a dense undercoat of fine wool-like hairs measuring 2.5–8 cm in length and longer, coarser outer guard hairs that could exceed 90 cm, providing exceptional thermal insulation against subzero temperatures. This shaggy coat trapped air for warmth, with genetic variations in hair length candidate genes such as FGF5 and KRT71 contributing to its development as an adaptation distinct from the sparse hair of modern elephants. Complementing the fur, a thick layer of subcutaneous fat, up to several centimeters deep, offered additional insulation and energy reserves during prolonged cold periods, supported by evolved genes for enhanced fat metabolism and storage similar to those in other Arctic mammals.00404-9) Small ears, significantly reduced in size compared to those of modern elephants, minimized surface area for heat loss and reduced the risk of frostbite, with mammoth-specific amino acid substitutions in genes linked to ear morphology reinforcing this trait.\n\nRecent analyses of ancient RNA extracted from a 39,000-year-old woolly mammoth specimen (as of November 2025) have provided direct evidence of active gene expression related to these adaptations, including genes involved in skin integrity, muscle function, and cold tolerance mechanisms at the time of the animal's death, confirming the physiological relevance of these traits in living individuals.\n\nAt the molecular level, the woolly mammoth's hemoglobin demonstrated adaptations for efficient oxygen transport in cold, low-oxygen conditions typical of high-altitude and frigid air. Genetic analyses and resurrection of authentic mammoth hemoglobin revealed key amino acid substitutions in the β/δ-globin subunit that increased oxygen affinity at lower temperatures, facilitating better oxygen delivery to tissues despite the reduced partial pressure of oxygen in icy environments. These biochemical properties countered the temperature-dependent rise in hemoglobin-oxygen affinity that impairs unloading in cold conditions, enabling sustained activity in subarctic habitats.\n\nThe woolly mammoth's elongated tusks served multiple functional roles beyond structural support, including foraging and defense. Their spiral curvature aided in stripping bark from trees and shrubs to access nutritious inner layers, a behavior inferred from wear patterns on fossil tusks and comparable to modern elephant practices. Fossil evidence frequently shows bilateral asymmetry in tusk length and shape, often resulting from injuries such as fractures during combat or accidents, which healed unevenly and altered growth trajectories over the animal's lifespan.\n\nThe trunk represented a highly dexterous sensory organ essential for foraging in sparse tundra vegetation. Like that of its closest relative, the Asian elephant, the woolly mammoth's trunk possessed exceptional manipulative capabilities, allowing precise grasping and manipulation of food items with its distal \"fingers,\" supported by shared genetic underpinnings for trunk musculature and innervation. Genetic studies of mammoth genomes indicate conserved chemoreception genes with elephants, enabling the trunk tip to detect chemical cues from plants and water sources at a distance, enhancing foraging efficiency in low-visibility, frozen landscapes.\n\n## Behavior and Ecology\n\n### Diet and Foraging\n\nMammoths were obligate herbivores that exhibited a mixed grazer-browser foraging strategy, primarily consuming grasses, sedges, forbs, shrubs, and occasionally tree bark to sustain their large body mass in the harsh Pleistocene environments. Analysis of ancient DNA from permafrost-preserved mammoth dung and environmental sediments indicates that their diet in Arctic regions included a mix of forbs, graminoids such as grasses and sedges, and low shrubs, with forbs being predominant in the vegetation during much of the period. In more temperate zones, isotopic evidence from tooth enamel suggests incorporation of browse like twigs and bark, particularly in winter when grasses were scarce or snow-covered. This dietary flexibility allowed mammoths to exploit the nutrient-poor steppe-tundra biome effectively, though their reliance on abrasive, silica-laden vegetation imposed significant wear on their dentition.\n\nTo meet energetic demands, adult mammoths required substantial daily forage intake, estimated at 78–104 kg of dry vegetation based on body size comparisons with modern proboscideans and metabolic modeling for Pleistocene conditions. Foraging likely occupied 16–20 hours per day, involving uprooting tussock grasses with their trunks and stripping bark from willows or conifers using tusks and incisors. Their hypsodont molars, characterized by tall crowns and transverse enamel ridges, were specialized adaptations for shearing and grinding tough, gritty plant material prevalent in glacial landscapes. These teeth underwent horizontal replacement, with up to six successive sets emerging over a mammoth's lifespan; each new molar migrated forward from the jaw's rear as the previous one wore down, ensuring prolonged functionality until the final set in old age.\n\nStable isotope analysis of sequentially sampled mammoth tusks and molars provides insights into foraging patterns, revealing seasonal dietary shifts driven by migrations over hundreds of kilometers to access fresh vegetation. In northern populations, carbon isotope ratios (δ¹³C) indicate predominant consumption of C₃ plants (such as sedges and shrubs) year-round, with regional variations reflecting local floral compositions. Oxygen isotopes (δ¹⁸O) further corroborate these movements, showing periodic access to varied water sources tied to browse availability, with regional differences—such as higher C₄ intake in North American interiors versus C₃ reliance in Eurasian tundras—reflecting local floral compositions. Elevated nitrogen isotopes (δ¹⁵N) in some specimens suggest consumption of dung-enriched or arid-adapted forage, highlighting specialized habitat use.\n\nAs keystone megafauna, mammoths significantly influenced Pleistocene ecosystems through their foraging behaviors, promoting nutrient cycling by dispersing seeds and fertilizing soils via massive dung deposits rich in undigested plant matter. Their trampling and grazing activities maintained open grasslands by suppressing woody shrub encroachment and shrub expansion, fostering the expansive mammoth steppe that supported diverse ungulate communities. Loss of these dynamics post-extinction led to vegetation shifts toward denser forests in some regions, underscoring mammoths' role in stabilizing grassland ecosystems.\n\n### Social Structure and Habitat\n\nMammoths exhibited a matriarchal social structure similar to that of modern elephants, with family groups typically consisting of 10-20 individuals led by an experienced adult female. These herds primarily comprised related females and their dependent offspring, providing protection and cooperative care for calves in the harsh Pleistocene environments. Upon reaching maturity, males would leave the family unit to live solitarily or form smaller, temporary bachelor groups, a pattern inferred from sex ratios in fossil assemblages and genetic analyses of bone beds showing higher proportions of subadult males in risky death sites.\n\nThe reproductive cycle of mammoths mirrored that of extant elephants, featuring a gestation period of approximately 22 months, after which a single calf was born. Calves remained highly dependent on their mothers and the matriarchal herd for several years, relying on milk and group defense against predators during this vulnerable phase. Fossil evidence from mass bone deposits, such as the Waco Mammoth National Monument in Texas, reveals instances of entire family groups—predominantly females and juveniles—perishing together in sudden natural events like flash floods or landslides, underscoring the cohesive nature of these herds and their vulnerability to environmental hazards.\n\nHabitat preferences varied by species, with woolly mammoths (Mammuthus primigenius) adapted to the expansive mammoth steppe—a cold, dry grassland ecosystem spanning northern Eurasia and North America during glacial periods, characterized by grasses, sedges, and herbs under permafrost conditions. In contrast, Columbian mammoths (Mammuthus columbi) inhabited warmer, more varied landscapes of open grasslands, savannas, and scattered woodlands across southern North America, favoring areas with abundant low-lying vegetation. Both species occupied altitudinal ranges up to approximately 2,000 meters, as evidenced by fossil finds in montane sites like the Alps and Pyrenees, allowing access to seasonal foraging zones.\n\nMigration patterns were driven by glacial cycles and vegetation shifts, with herds tracking nutrient-rich grasslands as ice sheets advanced and retreated. Woolly mammoths, for instance, undertook seasonal movements covering hundreds of kilometers annually, as reconstructed from strontium isotope analysis in tusks revealing lifetime travels exceeding 70,000 kilometers for individuals. These migrations followed the expansion and contraction of the mammoth steppe, enabling herds to exploit ephemeral foraging opportunities while maintaining social cohesion.\n\n## Human Interactions\n\n### Hunting and Utilization\n\nPrehistoric humans employed various techniques to hunt mammoths, adapting to the animals' size and behavior. In North America, the Clovis culture, dating to approximately 13,000 years ago, used fluted spear points mounted on pikes braced against the ground to impale charging mammoths during ambushes, as evidenced by sites like Lehner Ranch in Arizona where 13 points were found associated with the remains of multiple mammoths. In Siberia, Upper Paleolithic hunters at sites like Yana RHS, dated to 27,000–29,000 years ago, utilized ivory-tipped projectiles and other tools for mammoth hunting, with ethnographic analogies suggesting methods such as pit traps lined with stakes and fire drives to herd animals into kill zones, though direct archaeological evidence for these in Siberian contexts remains indirect.\n\nMammoth kill sites, numbering over 100 across Eurasia and North America from 40,000 to 15,000 years ago, provide key evidence of these interactions, often showing selective targeting of juveniles or weakened individuals to minimize risk and maximize efficiency, as seen in the age profiles at Yana RHS and sites like Krems-Wachtberg in Austria where calf remains dominate.\n\nOnce killed, mammoths served as a vital resource for early human societies. A single adult could provide substantial sustenance for groups, while hides were processed for clothing and shelter coverings. Bones were repurposed into tools, fuel, and structural elements for dwellings; at the Yana RHS site, accumulations of mammoth bones near human occupation layers indicate their use in constructing huts, supplemented by hides for insulation.\n\nMammoth ivory played a significant economic role, with evidence of processing and distribution networks spanning Siberia to Europe during the Upper Paleolithic (peaking around 30,000–15,000 years ago), as ivory artifacts appear in distant sites, suggesting trade for tool-making and symbolic objects.\n\n### Cultural Depictions\n\nMammoths have been depicted in Paleolithic art, reflecting their significance to early human societies during the Ice Age. In the Rouffignac Cave in southwestern France, dated to approximately 13,000 years ago and associated with the Magdalenian culture, over 100 engravings and drawings portray mammoths, earning the site the nickname \"Cave of a Hundred Mammoths.\" These black-painted and engraved figures, often shown in profile with distinctive curved tusks and humped backs, appear throughout the cave's galleries, alongside other Ice Age fauna like woolly rhinoceroses and bison. Similarly, at the Dolní Věstonice archaeological site in Moravia, Czech Republic, dating to around 26,000 years ago, portable carvings made from mammoth ivory include representations of animals such as mammoths, bears, and lions, alongside human figures and ornaments. These small-scale ivory artifacts, crafted at a mammoth-hunting settlement, demonstrate advanced sculptural techniques and suggest mammoths held cultural or ritual importance in Gravettian communities.\n\nIn mythology and folklore, mammoths often symbolized mysterious forces of nature. Among Siberian Indigenous groups like the Evenk, oral traditions portrayed mammoths as enormous underground creatures that burrowed through the earth, their movements causing earthquakes and upheavals. These beliefs arose from encounters with frozen mammoth remains emerging from permafrost, interpreted as evidence of living subterranean beasts rather than extinct animals. In ancient Greek accounts, Herodotus described encounters with large elephants in regions like Libya and during Persian campaigns involving Indian elephants, blending observations of real elephants with exaggerated tales of monstrous variants, influencing later European legends of colossal proboscideans.\n\nLater cultural depictions shifted toward spectacle and revival in Western entertainment. In the 19th century, traveling circuses and menageries frequently used the term \"mammoth\" to denote grand scale, with shows like Van Amburgh \\u0026 Co.'s Mammoth Menagerie exhibiting live elephants and exotic animals as proxies for the extinct beasts, evoking Ice Age wonders through parades and performances. These exhibitions romanticized mammoths as symbols of prehistoric might, often incorporating skeletal replicas or artistic models in sideshows to captivate audiences. In modern media, woolly mammoths are frequently romanticized as noble survivors of the Ice Age, appearing in films like the *Ice Age* animated franchise, where Manny the mammoth embodies family loyalty and resilience, and in books such as John Varley's *Mammoth* (2005), which explores cloning and human-animal bonds through time-travel narratives. Ben Mezrich's *Woolly* (2017), a nonfiction account of de-extinction efforts, further popularizes mammoths as icons of scientific ambition and lost wilderness.\n\nAcross Indigenous oral traditions in North America, mammoths carry symbolic weight as emblems of power and the Pleistocene era. The Salish people of British Columbia preserve a mammoth song and dance, invoking the creature's strength in rituals that connect to ancestral landscapes and environmental forces. Osage traditions recount epic battles among giant beasts, including mammoths, symbolizing cosmic struggles and the raw potency of Ice Age megafauna that shaped the world before human dominance. These narratives, transmitted across generations, underscore mammoths not merely as prey but as spiritual entities embodying endurance, transformation, and the untamed power of ancient ecosystems.\n\n## Extinction and Legacy\n\n### Causes and Timeline\n\nThe extinction of mammoths occurred at different times across species, reflecting regional environmental and anthropogenic pressures. The steppe mammoth (*Mammuthus trogontherii*), an early Eurasian species, disappeared by approximately 200,000 years ago, giving way to later forms like the woolly mammoth during the late Middle Pleistocene. In contrast, the woolly mammoth (*Mammuthus primigenius*) and Columbian mammoth (*Mammuthus columbi*) persisted into the late Pleistocene, with mainland populations declining sharply around 13,000–10,000 years ago amid the transition from glacial to interglacial conditions. Isolated groups of woolly mammoths survived longer, including on Wrangel Island off Siberia until about 3,700 years before present (calibrated), marking the final known extinction event for the genus.\n\nMammoth extinctions were multifactorial, with climate warming at the end of the Pleistocene playing a central role by causing widespread habitat loss for the mammoth steppe—a vast, productive grassland ecosystem that supported high megafaunal biomass during glacial periods. The Younger Dryas stadial (approximately 12,900–11,700 years ago), a brief return to cold conditions, preceded rapid warming into the Holocene, which transformed open steppe-tundra into shrub-dominated landscapes with reduced forage productivity, contracting suitable mammoth habitat by over 90% between 42,000 and 6,000 years before present. This environmental shift fragmented populations and diminished carrying capacity, as evidenced by ancient DNA from Arctic sediments showing the collapse of steppe vegetation communities around 12,600–11,500 years ago in regions like central Yukon.\n\nHuman overhunting exacerbated these climatic pressures, with archaeological evidence from dated kill and butchery sites correlating strongly with the expansion of *Homo sapiens* into mammoth ranges. Globally, at least 41 proboscidean kill/scavenge sites span from 1.8 million years ago to 10,000 years ago, clustering at the expanding frontiers of human settlement—such as northward into Eurasia and southward into the Americas—suggesting systematic exploitation that accelerated local extirpations. Population models indicate that human arrival triggered significant biomass declines, with simulations showing a collapse in mammoth numbers following the loss of climatically viable areas, where even low hunting rates (0.0049–0.37 individuals per person per year) could drive isolated populations to extinction in the Holocene.\n\nGenetic factors such as inbreeding and low diversity were present in remnant populations like those on Wrangel Island, with a small founding population of around 300 individuals persisting for approximately 6,000 years post-mainland extinction. However, recent genomic analysis indicates these did not doom the population to extinction through genomic meltdown or reduced adaptability; a sudden catastrophic event, such as a storm or disease, is more likely responsible for their final demise around 4,000 years ago.00577-4)\n\n### Modern Research and Revival Efforts\n\nModern research on woolly mammoths has advanced significantly through the discovery of exceptionally preserved specimens that provide insights into their anatomy and physiology. One of the most notable early finds is the Berezovka mammoth, a well-preserved adult male mummy discovered in 1900 near the Berezovka River in Siberia and excavated in 1901, offering the first detailed view of soft tissues, including skin, fur, and internal organs. More recent excavations have yielded even rarer preservation, such as the 2024 discovery in Siberia's Batagaika crater of the juvenile female mammoth nicknamed Yana, dated to approximately 50,000 years ago, which includes intact skin, fur, and trunk but no placenta; this represents one of the best-preserved mammoth carcasses ever found. Worldwide, over 500 articulated or partially articulated woolly mammoth skeletons have been documented in scientific collections and sites, enabling comparative studies of skeletal morphology across populations. These discoveries, often from permafrost regions, have fueled paleontological efforts by preserving biological materials suitable for advanced analysis.\n\nTechnological innovations have revolutionized the study of mammoth remains, allowing non-invasive examination of internal structures and genetic material. Computed tomography (CT) scans have been instrumental in visualizing soft tissues and organs without dissection; for instance, high-resolution CT imaging of baby mammoth mummies like Lyuba and Dima in 2011 and 2014 revealed details of their lungs, brains, and digestive systems, confirming causes of death such as suffocation from mudslides. In genetics, ancient DNA sequencing has progressed dramatically, with the first high-quality complete woolly mammoth genome published in 2015 from two Siberian specimens, achieving 17- to 54-fold coverage and enabling comparisons with modern elephants. This work uncovered evidence of interspecies hybridizations, such as the Middle Pleistocene origins of the North American Columbian mammoth through gene flow with woolly mammoths around 420,000 years ago, as revealed by million-year-old DNA sequences analyzed in 2021. Further studies in 2025 using ancient DNA from molars confirmed long-term hybridization between woolly and Columbian mammoths, contributing to their adaptability in diverse habitats.\n\nDe-extinction initiatives represent a bold frontier in mammoth research, aiming to revive mammoth-like traits in living relatives through genetic engineering. Founded in 2021, Colossal Biosciences has led efforts to edit the Asian elephant genome using CRISPR-Cas9 technology, targeting over 50 genes associated with woolly mammoth characteristics such as thick fur, subcutaneous fat for cold tolerance, and curved tusks; by 2025, the company reported successful creation of induced pluripotent stem cells from elephants and prototype models like mice exhibiting mammoth-inspired cold resistance and woolly coats. In November 2025, Colossal acquired ViaGen, a leading animal cloning company, to accelerate progress in cloning and reproductive technologies essential for producing mammoth hybrids. These advancements build on the 2015 mammoth genome, with plans for hybrid elephant-mammoth calves potentially viable by 2028 via artificial wombs, though full de-extinction remains challenging due to DNA gaps. Ethical debates surround these projects, particularly concerns over ecological impacts, including potential disruption to Arctic tundra ecosystems through altered grazing patterns or unintended hybridization with wild elephants, as well as animal welfare issues in surrogacy and containment. Proponents argue that such hybrids could restore grassland biodiversity by mimicking mammoth herbivory, but critics highlight risks of invasive species dynamics in modern climates.\n\nLessons from mammoth extinction inform contemporary conservation strategies for elephants, emphasizing the perils of habitat fragmentation and human pressures. Studies of late-surviving mammoth populations, such as those on Wrangel Island, reveal genetic bottlenecks leading to inbreeding depression, paralleling the low genetic diversity in endangered African and Asian elephants threatened by poaching and deforestation. For example, mammoth ivory trade regulations proposed in 2017 and 2019 aim to curb illegal elephant poaching by restricting fossil tusks, as the two are visually indistinguishable and fuel black markets. Insights into mammoth habitat loss from climate warming and overhunting underscore the need for protected corridors and anti-poaching measures to prevent similar fates for elephants, whose populations have declined significantly since 2000, with savanna elephants decreasing by around 30% between 2007 and 2014 and overall African elephant numbers falling by an estimated 70% over the past 50 years as of 2024. De-extinction research indirectly aids elephant conservation by advancing stem cell and gene-editing tools for enhancing disease resistance in captive breeding programs.",
