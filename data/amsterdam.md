## Historical Background

Amsterdam's history dates back to the late 12th century when it was founded as a small fishing village near the Amstel River. The name "Amsterdam" is derived from "Amstelledamme," meaning a dam on the Amstel River, reflecting its origins as a settlement built around a dam constructed to control flooding [Amsterdam History](https://www.amsterdam.info/history/).

- **Medieval Period**: By the 13th century, Amsterdam gained importance as a trade center after receiving city rights in 1306. Its strategic location facilitated trade with the Baltic Sea and other parts of Europe through the Hanseatic League.
- **Golden Age (17th Century)**: Amsterdam became a global economic powerhouse during the Dutch Golden Age, fueled by the success of the Dutch East India Company (VOC), the world's first multinational corporation.

- **Modern History**: The city faced challenges during the 18th and 19th centuries with economic decline and occupation by Napoleonic forces.
