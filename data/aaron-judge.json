  "content": "# Aaron Judge\n\nAaron Judge is an American professional baseball right fielder for the New York Yankees of Major League Baseball (MLB).  \nBorn on April 26, 1992, in Linden, California, Judge attended Fresno State University before being selected by the Yankees in the first round, 32nd overall, of the 2013 MLB Draft. At 6 feet 7 inches tall and 282 pounds, he is among the largest players in MLB history and is renowned for his prodigious power at the plate. Judge made his major league debut on August 13, 2016, and quickly emerged as one of the game's premier sluggers.  \n\nIn his rookie season of 2017, Judge earned the American League Rookie of the Year Award after hitting 52 home runs, winning the Home Run Derby, and securing his first Silver Slugger Award. He has since been selected to seven All-Star Games (2017, 2018, 2021–2025), won three AL Most Valuable Player Awards (2022, 2024, and 2025), and claimed four additional Silver Slugger Awards (2021, 2022, 2024, 2025). In 2022, Judge set the AL single-season home run record with 62, leading the majors in home runs, runs batted in, on-base plus slugging, and OPS+, while posting a .311 batting average. Following that season, he re-signed with the Yankees on a nine-year, $360 million contract—the largest in franchise history—and was named the 16th captain in team history.  \n\nJudge's 2025 campaign was another standout, as he won the AL batting title with a .331 average, led the league in OPS (1.145) and runs scored (137), and hit 53 home runs with 114 RBIs over 152 games. Off the field, he founded the All Rise Foundation in 2018 to support youth programs and was honored with the 2023 Roberto Clemente Award for his philanthropy and positive impact on the community. Through the 2025 season, Judge has compiled a .294 career batting average, 368 home runs, and an 1.028 OPS in 1,145 games, solidifying his status as a cornerstone of the Yankees and one of baseball's elite power hitters.\n\n## Early life and amateur career\n\n### Early life and family\n\nAaron Judge was born on April 26, 1992, in Linden, California. He was adopted the day after his birth by Patty and Wayne Judge, a couple who had married in 1975 after meeting at Fresno State University and were both working as schoolteachers in the Linden area at the time.\n\nThe Judges already had one son, John Jacob, whom they adopted in 1985; John would later become a teacher himself, following his parents' profession. The family dynamics centered on fostering strong character and discipline, with Patty and Wayne prioritizing their sons' personal development over early athletic specialization. They explained Aaron's adoption to him around age 10, a revelation he later described as feeling like \"God was the one that matched us together,\" reflecting the deep bond he shared with his parents. The couple emphasized education as a cornerstone, requiring homework completion before any playtime and instilling values of hard work and integrity that shaped Aaron's approach to life.\n\nRaised in Linden, a small agricultural town about 100 miles northeast of San Francisco known for its cherry orchards and tight-knit community, Aaron enjoyed a modest, supportive childhood environment. From a young age, he displayed natural athletic talent, particularly with a ball in his hands, and his parents encouraged exposure to multiple sports such as basketball and football in addition to baseball to promote teamwork and well-rounded growth. This early involvement in community activities, including volunteering with his youth basketball team, further reinforced the family's values of collaboration and giving back.\n\n### High school career\n\nAaron Judge attended Linden High School in Linden, California, from 2006 to 2010, where he emerged as a standout multi-sport athlete. He participated in varsity baseball as a right-handed pitcher and first baseman (serving as team captain), varsity basketball as a center and forward, and varsity football as a wide receiver.\n\nIn baseball, Judge excelled during his senior year in 2010, batting .500 with 37 hits in 74 at-bats, including 7 home runs and 32 RBIs over 27 games. On the mound, he posted a 0.88 ERA across 48 innings pitched, recording 6 wins and 65 strikeouts while holding opponents to a .114 batting average. His performance earned him a spot on The Record's All-Area first team for baseball.\n\nJudge also shone in football during his senior season, hauling in 54 receptions for 969 yards and 17 touchdowns as a wide receiver, setting school records for single-season receiving yards and touchdown receptions. In basketball that same year, he averaged a double-double with 18.2 points and 12.8 rebounds per game over 25 contests, leading the team in scoring. He was recognized on The Record's All-Area first team for both football and basketball as well.\n\nFollowing his senior year, Judge was selected by the Oakland Athletics in the 31st round (947th overall) of the 2010 Major League Baseball Draft but opted not to sign, choosing instead to continue his baseball career at Fresno State University.\n\n### College career\n\nJudge enrolled at California State University, Fresno in 2010 and joined the Fresno State Bulldogs baseball team, where he primarily played as an outfielder. His freshman year was redshirted, allowing him to focus on recovery and development. This setback provided time to build strength and adjust to college-level play, drawing from the versatile athletic foundation he established in high school.\n\nOver his three active seasons from 2011 to 2013, Judge demonstrated emerging power and discipline at the plate, compiling a .345 batting average with 18 home runs and 93 RBI in 169 games. As a redshirt freshman in 2011, he hit .358 with 2 home runs and 30 RBI in 55 games, earning Freshman All-American honors from Louisville Slugger, Western Athletic Conference (WAC) Freshman of the Year, and first-team All-WAC recognition. In his sophomore year of 2012, despite dealing with a hip strain that limited some mobility, he batted .308 with 4 home runs and 27 RBI in 58 games, securing first-team All-WAC honors, WAC All-Tournament Team selection, and victory in the College Home Run Derby by hitting 16 home runs across three rounds.\n\nJudge's junior season in 2013 marked a breakout, as he posted a .369 average with 12 home runs and 36 RBI in 56 games, leading the team in several offensive categories and earning first-team All-Mountain West Conference honors after the WAC realignment. Throughout his college career, he improved his plate discipline, consistently drawing walks—totaling 108 across three years—and harnessing his raw power, which scouts noted as plus potential despite a high strikeout rate. These developments positioned him as a top prospect, leading to his selection by the New York Yankees with the 32nd overall pick in the first round of the 2013 MLB Draft following his junior year.\n\n## Professional career\n\n### 2010 MLB Draft and minor leagues\n\nJudge was first selected in the 31st round of the 2010 MLB Draft by the Oakland Athletics out of Linden High School in California, but he opted not to sign and instead attended Fresno State University.\n\nFollowing a standout junior season at Fresno State in 2013, where he batted .369 with 12 home runs and 56 RBIs, Judge was chosen by the New York Yankees with the 32nd overall pick in the first round of the 2013 MLB Draft. He signed a contract on July 12, 2013, for a $1.8 million signing bonus.\n\nA torn right quad muscle sustained during his college season prevented Judge from making his professional debut in 2013, delaying his entry into the minor leagues until the following year.\n\nJudge began his minor league career in 2014 with the Class A Charleston RiverDogs, where he hit .333 with nine home runs in 65 games before earning a promotion to the Class A Advanced Tampa Yankees, batting .283 with eight home runs in 66 games. He concluded the year in the Arizona Fall League with the Scottsdale Scorpions, appearing in 24 games.\n\nIn 2015, Judge advanced to the Class AA Trenton Thunder, compiling a .284 average and 12 home runs across 63 games, which led to a midseason promotion to the Class AAA Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders, where he batted .224 with eight home runs in 61 games.\n\nOver his 2014 and 2015 minor league seasons, spanning 255 games at various levels from Class A to Class AAA, Judge maintained a .283 batting average while hitting 37 home runs, demonstrating significant power potential. However, he grappled with a high strikeout rate, frequently surpassing 30% of his plate appearances, and the rigors of adapting to professional baseball's physical and mental demands.\n\n### 2016 season\n\nAaron Judge was called up to the major leagues by the New York Yankees on August 13, 2016, making his debut that day as the starting right fielder against the Tampa Bay Rays at Yankee Stadium. In his first at-bat, Judge hit a three-run home run off Rays pitcher Matt Moore, becoming the first Yankee to homer in his debut at-bat since 2007 and marking a promising start to his big-league career. This debut highlighted his raw power potential, as the 446-foot blast cleared the right-field seats and landed in the Legends Suite.\n\nOver the course of the season, Judge appeared in 27 games for the Yankees, batting .179 with 15 hits, four home runs, and 10 RBIs in 95 plate appearances. His performance was marked by significant strikeout issues, fanning 42 times—nearly half his plate appearances—reflecting early adjustments to major-league pitching after a strong minor-league campaign where he had honed his skills at Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. Despite the struggles, Judge's power was evident in his four home runs, which demonstrated the elite exit velocities and distance he could generate, even in limited opportunities.\n\nJudge primarily played right field but also served as the designated hitter on several occasions, filling a role in an outfield group undergoing transitions amid the Yankees' rebuilding efforts. His season ended prematurely on September 14 due to a Grade 2 right oblique strain sustained during a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers, sidelining him for the remainder of the regular season. The Yankees finished the year with an 84-78 record, placing fourth in the American League East and missing the playoffs for the third consecutive season.\n\n### 2017 season\n\nIn 2017, Aaron Judge secured the starting role in right field for the New York Yankees on Opening Day, marking his transition to a full-time everyday player following a brief debut the previous year. He appeared in 155 games that season, batting .284 with 52 home runs—a then-American League rookie record—114 RBIs, and a 1.049 OPS, showcasing his power and plate discipline with 127 walks drawn. These figures helped propel the Yankees to an 91-71 record and a wild card berth, as Judge's offensive output ranked among the league leaders in home runs (second), on-base percentage (second at .422), and slugging percentage (third at .627).\n\nKey milestones defined Judge's breakout campaign, including his first home run of the season on April 9 against the Baltimore Orioles, off pitcher Ubaldo Jiménez, which traveled 424 feet to left-center field. He achieved his first multi-home run game on April 28 versus the Toronto Blue Jays, hitting two long balls in a 9-3 win, and later won the 2017 T-Mobile Home Run Derby at the All-Star Game in Miami, defeating Miguel Sano 11-10 in the finals after launching 47 total homers across four rounds—the first rookie to claim the title outright. By September 25, Judge tied and then broke Mark McGwire's MLB rookie home run record with his 49th and 50th homers against the Kansas City Royals.\n\nThe Yankees advanced through the postseason, defeating the Minnesota Twins 3-0 in the AL Wild Card Game and Cleveland Indians 3-2 in the ALDS, before falling to the Houston Astros 4-3 in the ALCS. In 13 playoff games, Judge batted .188 with four home runs—including his first postseason homer in Game 1 of the ALDS—and 11 RBIs, though he struggled with 19 strikeouts.\n\nJudge's dominant rookie performance earned him the unanimous American League Rookie of the Year Award, receiving all 30 first-place votes from the Baseball Writers' Association of America. He was also selected to his first All-Star Game, won the American League Silver Slugger Award as the top offensive right fielder, and finished second in AL MVP voting behind José Altuve.\n\n### 2018 season\n\nJudge entered the 2018 season as the reigning American League Rookie of the Year following his breakout 2017 campaign, in which he hit 52 home runs and drove in 114 runs. He started strongly, posting a .309 batting average with 8 home runs in his first 37 games, showcasing the power that had defined his prior year. However, his season was derailed by injury, marking a dip in performance compared to his established baseline.\n\nOn July 26, 2018, during a game against the Kansas City Royals, Judge was hit on the right wrist by a 93.4 mph fastball from pitcher Jakob Junis, resulting in a chip fracture of the ulnar styloid bone. This injury placed him on the 10-day disabled list the following day and sidelined him for 45 games, as the delicate nature of wrist fractures often prolongs recovery for hitters due to impacts on grip and swing power. At the time of the injury, Judge had appeared in 93 games, batting .271 with 25 home runs and 60 RBIs, contributing significantly to the Yankees' strong first half.\n\nJudge returned to the lineup on September 14 after a rigorous rehabilitation process involving tee work, soft-toss hitting, and outfield drills to rebuild strength and timing. In his 19 games upon return, he batted .290 with 2 home runs and 7 RBIs, helping the Yankees secure a playoff spot. Overall, Judge played 112 games, finishing with a .278 batting average, 27 home runs, and 67 RBIs—solid but diminished figures reflective of the injury's toll. The Yankees concluded the regular season with a 100-62 record, earning the top AL wild card, but were eliminated in the ALDS by the Boston Red Sox in a 1-3 series.\n\n### 2019 season\n\nJudge began the 2019 season recovering from wrist and thumb injuries that had limited him to just 112 games the previous year. On April 20, he suffered a left oblique strain during a game against the Kansas City Royals, leading to his placement on the 10-day injured list the following day. To rehabilitate, Judge completed five minor league games with Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre in mid-June, where he hit .350 with one home run. He returned to the majors on June 21, batting leadoff for the first time in his career that day.\n\nIn 102 regular-season games, Judge posted a .272 batting average with 27 home runs and 55 RBIs, providing solid power production despite his abbreviated season. He demonstrated positional flexibility by primarily playing right field in 92 games while also serving as the designated hitter in 10 contests to manage his health. Later, a right shoulder injury sidelined him for one game on September 20.\n\nThe New York Yankees finished the regular season with a 103-59 record, securing the American League East title. In the postseason, Judge hit .333 with three hits in three ALDS games against the Minnesota Twins, helping the Yankees sweep the series 3-0. However, the team fell to the Houston Astros 4-2 in the ALCS, where Judge batted .240 with one home run and two RBIs over six games. Overall in the playoffs, he finished with a .265 average across nine games.\n\n### 2020 season\n\nThe 2020 Major League Baseball season was abbreviated to 60 games due to the COVID-19 pandemic, running from July 23 to September 27 in a bid to complete play amid health restrictions. Aaron Judge, who had dealt with a right calf strain during the delayed spring training and early regular season, missed the Yankees' first 24 games before debuting on August 16. He re-aggravated the injury after just 10 games, landing back on the injured list until September 16, ultimately appearing in 28 regular-season contests. In limited action, Judge batted .257 with 9 home runs and 22 RBIs, achieving an .890 OPS that ranked among the American League leaders in on-base plus slugging for players with at least 100 plate appearances.\n\nThe season's unique challenges included rigorous COVID-19 protocols enforced by MLB, such as daily testing for players and staff, a ban on spitting or licking fingers to reduce virus transmission, social distancing in clubhouses, and all games played in empty stadiums without spectators. The compressed schedule—averaging nearly a game per day for each team—tested player durability, particularly for someone like Judge returning from injury in a high-intensity environment with limited recovery time between contests.\n\nIn the expanded postseason, the Yankees swept the Cleveland Indians 2-0 in the best-of-three Wild Card Series, highlighted by Judge's two-run home run in the first inning of Game 1 off ace Shane Bieber, which helped secure a 12-3 victory and set an early tone for the series. However, New York fell to the Tampa Bay Rays 2-3 in the American League Division Series, with Judge managing a .143 batting average across five games but providing power via two home runs and three RBIs despite 11 strikeouts.\n\n### 2021 season\n\nIn the 2021 season, Aaron Judge provided steady production for the New York Yankees, playing in 148 games while batting .287 with 39 home runs, 98 RBIs, and an OPS of .917. His performance included a .331 batting average and .984 OPS with runners in scoring position, showcasing his ability to deliver in key situations. Building on his experience from the 2020 postseason, where the Yankees advanced to the AL Division Series, Judge helped anchor the lineup during a campaign that saw New York finish with a 92-70 record and secure a playoff berth.\n\nJudge earned his third All-Star selection and started in right field for the American League at the 2021 All-Star Game in Denver, where he went 1-for-3 with a run scored. He also received the Lou Gehrig Memorial Award for embodying the ideals of the Yankees' legendary captain, highlighting his character and contributions on and off the field.\n\nAt season's end, Judge was awarded the Silver Slugger for the American League outfield, recognizing his offensive prowess among qualified players. Additionally, he won the Yankees' Heart \\u0026 Hustle Award, given to an active player for leadership, passion, and dedication to baseball.\n\nThe Yankees' postseason ended abruptly in the American League Wild Card Game against the Boston Red Sox on October 5, with New York losing 6-2; Judge finished 1-for-4 with a single but no RBIs or extra-base hits, posting a .500 OPS in his lone appearance.\n\n### 2022 season\n\nIn the 2022 season, Aaron Judge delivered a historic performance for the New York Yankees, playing in 157 games and posting a .311 batting average with 62 home runs, 131 runs batted in, and a 1.111 on-base plus slugging percentage. His home run total tied Roger Maris' American League single-season record, which Judge surpassed with his 62nd homer on October 4 against the Texas Rangers in a 3-2 loss. Judge led the majors in home runs and RBIs while finishing second in batting average to Luis Arraez of the Minnesota Twins, falling five points short of the AL Triple Crown. For his dominant output, he earned the American League Most Valuable Player Award, becoming the first Yankee to win it since Alex Rodriguez in 2007.\n\nThe Yankees secured an AL wild-card berth and advanced past the Cleveland Guardians in the AL Division Series, where Judge contributed two home runs, including a pivotal three-run shot in Game 5. However, New York was swept by the Houston Astros 4-0 in the AL Championship Series, with Judge batting .139 (5-for-36) over nine postseason games, including two home runs and three RBIs.\n\nFollowing the season, Judge signed a nine-year, $360 million contract extension with the Yankees on December 20, the largest in franchise history at the time, securing his long-term future with the team after entering free agency. During the contract announcement on December 21, 2022, Judge was named the 16th captain in Yankees franchise history.\n\n### 2023 season\n\nIn the early part of the 2023 season, Aaron Judge started strongly for the New York Yankees, posting a .291 batting average with 19 home runs and 40 RBIs in 49 games before suffering a significant injury.  On June 3, 2023, while chasing a fly ball in right field at Dodger Stadium, Judge collided with the outfield wall, resulting in a torn ligament in his right big toe.  The injury, initially diagnosed as a sprain, sidelined him for 42 games as he was placed on the 10-day injured list retroactive to June 4; no surgery was required, but he underwent rehabilitation focused on strengthening the toe and managing pain through platelet-rich plasma injections. \n\nJudge returned to the lineup on July 28, 2023, against the Baltimore Orioles, but the lingering effects of the injury impacted his mobility and swing mechanics, leading to an adjusted .245 batting average over his final 57 games.  Despite the challenges, he maintained elite power, hitting 18 home runs with a .557 slugging percentage and a 164 wRC+ in that stretch, though he experienced periods of inconsistency as he rebuilt his timing.  Overall, Judge appeared in 106 games, finishing with a .267 batting average, 37 home runs, and 75 RBIs, numbers that underscored his value even in a limited role. \n\nThe injury contributed to the Yankees' struggles, as the team finished the season with an 82-80 record, placing fourth in the AL East and missing the playoffs for the first time since 2016 amid a rash of key injuries.  Judge's absence highlighted the team's reliance on his production, but his recently signed nine-year, $360 million contract provided financial security during the recovery process. Postseason play was not a factor, as the Yankees were eliminated from contention on September 24. Judge later noted that the toe would require ongoing maintenance throughout his career, emphasizing a cautious approach to long-term rehabilitation.\n\n### 2024 season\n\nJudge entered the 2024 season fully recovered from a severe toe injury that had limited him to just nine games in 2023. Playing in 158 games for the New York Yankees, he posted a .322 batting average with 58 home runs, 144 runs batted in, and a 1.159 on-base plus slugging percentage, leading the American League in home runs, RBIs, on-base percentage, slugging percentage, and OPS. His performance placed him second in the AL batting average behind Bobby Witt Jr., marking one of the closest pursuits of the Triple Crown in recent years, though he ultimately fell short.\n\nJudge's dominant year earned him multiple accolades, including his second American League Most Valuable Player Award in a unanimous vote, his sixth All-Star selection, his fourth Silver Slugger Award, and the Hank Aaron Award as the AL's top offensive performer. On August 14, against the Chicago White Sox, he hit his 300th career home run, achieving the milestone in just 955 games, the fewest in Major League Baseball history.\n\nIn the postseason, the Yankees advanced to the World Series for the first time since 2009, defeating the Kansas City Royals 3-1 in the ALDS and the Cleveland Guardians 4-1 in the ALCS to claim the American League pennant. However, they fell to the Los Angeles Dodgers 4-1 in the World Series, where Judge batted .222 with one home run and three RBIs over five games. Throughout the year, Judge's leadership as Yankees captain was praised for fostering team unity and accountability in the clubhouse, contributing to the club's success beyond his statistical output..com/world-series-2024-aaron-judges-second-superpower-is-guiding-the-yankees-in-ways-that-dont-show-up-in-the-box-score-010443471.html)\n\n### 2025 season\n\nBuilding on his 2024 American League Most Valuable Player Award, Aaron Judge delivered another exceptional season in 2025, anchoring the New York Yankees' lineup with elite production at the plate. In 152 games, Judge recorded 541 at-bats, batting .331 with 53 home runs, 114 runs batted in, 12 stolen bases, and a 1.145 on-base plus slugging percentage, leading the American League in batting average and OPS. His 179 hits and 137 runs scored further highlighted his dominance, as he became the tallest player in MLB history to win a batting title.\n\nJudge's outstanding campaign earned him widespread recognition, including his seventh All-Star selection, his second consecutive AL MVP award, and a record fifth Silver Slugger Award as the top offensive outfielder in the American League. These honors underscored his consistent excellence, with the Silver Slugger marking him as one of the premier hitters in the league for the fifth time in his career.\n\nThe Yankees finished the 2025 regular season with a 94-68 record, securing second place in the AL East and a playoff berth as a wild card team, with a strategic emphasis on bolstering outfield defense to complement their offensive firepower—Judge played a key role in right field with his strong arm and range. This balanced approach helped the team clinch the division's top wild card spot despite a competitive AL East race.\n\nIn the postseason, the Yankees advanced by defeating the Boston Red Sox 2-1 in the Wild Card Series but were eliminated in the AL Division Series by the Toronto Blue Jays, losing 1-3. Judge shone across the seven games, hitting .500 (13-for-26) with 1 home run and 7 RBIs, providing crucial offensive support amid the early exit.\n\n## International career\n\n### 2023 World Baseball Classic\n\nIn December 2022, shortly after re-signing with the New York Yankees on a nine-year, $360 million contract, Aaron Judge opted out of participating in the 2023 World Baseball Classic for Team USA.\n\nJudge's decision stemmed from a desire to prioritize his health and preparation for the upcoming MLB season, especially after a demanding 2022 campaign where he set the American League single-season home run record with 62. The Yankees, exercising caution to ensure their new captain was fully ready for spring training and the rigors of a full season, supported his choice to focus on team goals like pursuing a World Series title. He emphasized that while representing the United States would be an honor, his primary commitment was to the Yankees, stating, \"It would be an honor to represent my country and play in that... But my main goal is what I can do here in New York and what I can do to bring a championship back here.\"\n\nDespite not playing, Judge supported Team USA from afar, later admitting it was tough to watch the tournament without participating. His absence as one of baseball's premier power hitters was widely noted in media coverage, with analysts highlighting the potential impact on the U.S. lineup amid high expectations for the defending champions.\n\nTeam USA advanced to the final but ultimately earned silver, falling 3-2 to Japan in a dramatic championship game on March 21, 2023, at LoanDepot Park in Miami.\n\n### 2026 World Baseball Classic\n\nOn April 14, 2025, Aaron Judge was announced as the first player committed to Team USA for the 2026 World Baseball Classic and named its captain, succeeding Mike Trout who had led the team to a silver medal in 2023. The announcement, made by Team USA manager Mark DeRosa during a segment on MLB Network at Yankee Stadium, highlighted Judge's leadership qualities and stature in the sport.\n\nThis will mark Judge's debut in the World Baseball Classic, as he opted out of the 2023 tournament following his re-signing with the Yankees. He expressed enthusiasm for the opportunity, stating it would be \"pretty fun\" and \"cool to represent your country,\" a sentiment echoed by Yankees manager Aaron Boone who noted Judge's excitement about the role.\n\nAs captain, Judge has emphasized his offseason training regimen to prepare for the event, focusing on conditioning to lead the team effectively. The tournament is scheduled for March 6–17, 2026, with Pool B games hosted at Daikin Park in Houston, Texas, and subsequent rounds including quarterfinals in Houston and Miami, semifinals, and the final at loanDepot park in Miami, Florida.\n\nJudge's leadership aims to guide Team USA to its first gold medal in the Classic, building on the 2023 runner-up finish where they fell to Japan in the championship game.\n\n## Records and achievements\n\n### New York Yankees records\n\nAaron Judge holds several prominent records in New York Yankees franchise history, particularly in the realm of power hitting, where his prodigious home run output has redefined benchmarks for the team.\n\nIn 2022, Judge established the Yankees' single-season home run record by hitting 62, surpassing Roger Maris's longstanding mark of 61 set in 1961; this feat occurred on October 4 against the Texas Rangers, marking the culmination of a historic chase that captivated the baseball world.\n\nDuring his rookie campaign in 2017, Judge set the franchise record for most home runs by a rookie with 52, eclipsing Joe DiMaggio's previous mark of 29 from 1936; this total also led the American League and earned him the Rookie of the Year award.\n\nAs of the end of the 2025 season, Judge stands as the active leader in career home runs among Yankees players with 368, a total that places him fourth all-time in franchise history behind Babe Ruth (659), Mickey Mantle (536), and Lou Gehrig (493).\n\nKey milestones in Judge's power-hitting progression include his 200th career home run, hit on July 30, 2022, against the Kansas City Royals in a 8-2 Yankees victory, achieved in just 671 games—the second-fastest pace in MLB history.\n\nHe reached his 300th career home run on August 14, 2024, off Chicago White Sox pitcher Chad Kuhl in an 10-2 win, becoming the fastest player in MLB history to accomplish this in 955 games and 3,586 at-bats.\n\nIn 2024, Judge also recorded 144 RBIs in a single season, driving in runs at an elite clip during his MVP-winning year.\n\n### American League records\n\nAaron Judge set the American League single-season home run record with 62 homers in 2022, surpassing Roger Maris's mark of 61 from 1961. This achievement also established the AL record for most home runs by a right-handed batter in a season, eclipsing previous benchmarks set by players like Jimmie Foxx.\n\nIn his 2017 rookie season, Judge hit 52 home runs, setting the AL rookie record and the overall major league mark for a first-year player at the time. This performance highlighted his immediate power impact in the league, outpacing the prior AL rookie standard of 49 set by Mark McGwire in 1987.\n\nJudge further distinguished himself with back-to-back 50-plus home run seasons in 2024 (58 homers) and 2025 (53 homers), becoming the first American League player to achieve consecutive such campaigns since Babe Ruth in the 1920s. Through these feats, he surpassed Ruth and Foxx in key AL power metrics, including multiple instances of leading the league in home runs and establishing new thresholds for right-handed sluggers in seasonal output.\n\n### Major League Baseball records\n\nAaron Judge's 62 home runs in the 2022 season marked the highest total in Major League Baseball since Sammy Sosa's 66 in 2001, establishing him as a central figure in the sport's power-hitting renaissance. Although not the overall single-season record—held by Barry Bonds with 73 in 2001—Judge's accomplishment highlighted his elite power, achieved without the controversy surrounding the steroid era.\n\nIn terms of career milestones, Judge reached 300 home runs in just 955 games during the 2024 season, the fastest pace in MLB history, surpassing Ralph Kiner's previous mark of 1,087 games. He extended this rapid ascent by hitting his 350th home run in 1,088 games in 2025, shattering Mark McGwire's record of 1,280 games by 192. Through the 2025 season, Judge had accumulated 368 home runs by age 33, placing him 10th all-time in home run pace among players with at least 300 homers, measured by homers per game played.\n\nJudge shares the MLB record for the most seasons with 50 or more home runs, achieving the feat four times (2017, 2022, 2024, and 2025), tied with Babe Ruth and Mark McGwire. His 2025 campaign included 53 home runs alongside 12 stolen bases, contributing to his reputation for combining power and speed in an era dominated by specialized roles. Additionally, at 6 feet 7 inches tall, Judge holds the distinction of being the tallest player ever to record a 50-home-run season.\n\nComparisons to Babe Ruth often arise in analyses of Judge's power metrics, particularly his ability to sustain high slugging percentages over multiple seasons; for instance, Judge's .688 slugging in 2025 echoed Ruth's dominance in blending average and extra-base power. His four seasons with an OPS exceeding 1.100 (2017: 1.067, 2022: 1.111, 2024: 1.159, 2025: 1.145) rank among the best in modern MLB history for consistency at that elite level.\n\n### Awards and honors\n\nAaron Judge's professional accolades began in his rookie season of 2017, when he was selected as the American League Rookie of the Year by unanimous vote from the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA). That year, he also finished second in AL Most Valuable Player (MVP) voting, receiving two first-place votes behind winner José Altuve. Judge earned his first Silver Slugger Award as an outfielder, recognizing his offensive excellence among AL outfielders, and won the Hank Aaron Award for top offensive performance in the AL. Additionally, he claimed the Home Run Derby title at MLB All-Star Week, hitting 47 home runs in the final round.\n\nJudge made his first All-Star appearance in 2017 and added a second selection in 2018, though injuries limited his season. He returned strongly in 2021 with his third All-Star nod and a second Silver Slugger Award, while finishing fourth in AL MVP voting with three third-place and five fourth-place votes.\n\nIn 2022, Judge captured his first AL MVP Award, earning 28 of 30 first-place votes after leading the majors in home runs and on-base plus slugging. He also secured his third All-Star selection, third Silver Slugger, and second Hank Aaron Award that season.\n\nJudge earned consecutive All-Star honors in 2023 and 2024, along with the Roberto Clemente Award in 2023 for his exemplary character and community contributions, including support for youth initiatives through his All Rise Foundation. In 2024, he won his second AL MVP Award unanimously, receiving all 30 first-place votes, his fourth Silver Slugger, third Hank Aaron Award, and the AL batting title with a .322 average.\n\nExtending his streak, Judge was selected to his seventh All-Star Game in 2025. He claimed his fifth Silver Slugger Award after leading the AL with a .331 batting average, securing his second consecutive batting title.\n\n## Playing style\n\n### Batting profile\n\nAaron Judge is renowned for his exceptional power hitting, characterized by elite exit velocities and an optimized launch angle that maximizes home run production. His career average exit velocity exceeds 95 mph, with a 2025 mark of 95.4 mph placing him among the league leaders in hard-hit rate at 58.2% and barrel rate at 24.7%, metrics that underscore his ability to consistently square up baseballs for maximum distance. These qualities have contributed to a career batting average of .294 and slugging percentage of .613 through the 2025 season, during which he hit 53 home runs in 152 games.\n\nJudge's plate discipline features a strong walk rate of approximately 16% over his career, reflecting his selective approach at the plate, though this is tempered by an elevated strikeout rate around 27%, which has been a persistent aspect of his profile. Post-2017, he has shown notable improvements in swing discipline by refining his approach to better cover the strike zone, reducing chases outside the zone while maintaining his power.\n\nHis evolution as a hitter began with significant swing adjustments in the minors, where he overhauled a previously inefficient motion—described by coaches as \"terrible\"—to improve zone control and bat path, transforming him from a high-strikeout prospect into a disciplined slugger. This culminated in a peak from 2022 to 2025, with batting averages exceeding .320 in multiple seasons, including .331 in 2025, driven by further tweaks like a more closed stance to enhance plate coverage.\n\nIn advanced metrics, Judge ranks in the top five all-time among right fielders with a career weighted runs created plus (wRC+) of 178, a testament to his offensive impact relative to league and park-adjusted standards, while his status as a barrel rate leader highlights his consistent quality of contact.\n\n### Fielding and defense\n\nAaron Judge has primarily played right field throughout his Major League Baseball career with the New York Yankees, where he has demonstrated strong defensive capabilities despite his imposing 6-foot-7 frame. His career fielding percentage in the outfield stands at .994, reflecting reliable glovework in handling routine plays. In peak seasons, Judge's defensive value has been notable, posting +9 Defensive Runs Saved (DRS) in 2017 and +5 in 2022, metrics that highlight his ability to prevent runs through positioning and execution.\n\nJudge's arm strength is one of his standout defensive traits, often described as a \"cannon\" capable of delivering throws exceeding 100 mph, with a career average arm strength of 95.3 mph according to Statcast data. In 2017, he recorded 5 outfield assists. These throws have added significant value, contributing positively to his arm runs saved in advanced metrics.\n\nWhile predominantly a right fielder, Judge has shown versatility by playing center field in 52 games during the 2019 season and occasionally shifting to left field in limited appearances to accommodate team needs. His defensive play has been Gold Glove-caliber, earning him finalist nods in right field for the 2017 and 2018 awards, though he has yet to win the honor.\n\nJudge's height presents challenges to his range, as his long strides can sometimes limit lateral quickness compared to smaller outfielders, leading to occasional negative marks in range-based metrics like Ultimate Zone Rating (UZR). Additionally, injuries, including oblique strains, a fractured toe in 2023, and a right elbow flexor strain in 2025 that reduced his average arm strength to 89.6 mph, have periodically impacted his mobility and overall defensive contributions.\n\n### Pregame rituals\n\nAaron Judge's pregame batting practice routine emphasizes mechanical consistency and adaptability, beginning with tee work to refine his swing across various pitch locations, such as middle-in, away, and up-and-in, while aiming for line drives toward the second baseman or the Yankee Stadium bullpen. He progresses to side tosses for about five to six repetitions, focusing on early barrel entry and directional control, followed by front tosses that incorporate variable speeds and locations to test balance, including a \"hang drill\" to improve load timing and stance comfort. Throughout, Judge incorporates weighted bats to synchronize his mechanics, as he has noted using heavier bats to ensure the barrel stays in front during swings, a practice he resumed fully after injury recoveries to maintain timing.\n\nFor mental preparation, Judge relies on visualization techniques, watching a customized video compilation before each game—produced by the Yankees' mental conditioning staff—that highlights his top performances, such as powerful swings and defensive plays, interspersed with clips of legendary athletes like Michael Jordan and Peyton Manning to foster a success-oriented mindset. This ritual helps him transition into his on-field \"No. 99\" persona, inspired by Kobe Bryant's \"Black Mamba\" alter ego, allowing him to compartmentalize doubts and slumps; he also incorporates a pregame prayer in the batting cage to center his focus. Additionally, Judge draws from readings like *Mind Gym* by Gary Mack and *The Art of War* by Sun Tzu to build mental resilience, viewing these as essential to his preparation alongside physical training.\n\nJudge maintains consistent uniform habits, always wearing jersey number 99, which was assigned to him during 2016 spring training and has since become a signature element of his identity, symbolizing his unique presence in the lineup. He also adheres to a high-socks style originating from his Little League days, when ill-fitting uniforms necessitated pulling them up, a look he has preserved as a superstitious nod to his early baseball roots that he credits for contributing to his on-field comfort and performance.\n\nThese rituals evolved notably after his 2017 rookie season, particularly during a midseason slump when Judge introduced habits like chewing two pieces of Dubble Bubble gum at the start of each game—continuing until his first out—to maintain focus and ritualistic rhythm, a practice that helped him regain consistency amid high expectations following his AL Rookie of the Year campaign. Post-2017, he intensified his mental and preparatory routines, integrating structured visualization and conditioning sessions to combat variability in performance, ensuring they provide a reliable framework during extended slumps or injury recoveries.\n\n## Off-field activities\n\n### Philanthropy\n\nAaron Judge founded the All Rise Foundation in 2018 as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to inspiring children and youth to become responsible citizens through programs focused on education, health, nutrition, leadership development, and character building. The foundation engages underserved communities by providing mentorship, scholarships, and opportunities to foster personal growth and unlimited potential among young people.\n\nKey initiatives include the ALL RISE Mini-Grant Program, which awards funding to youth-focused projects in areas such as Bronx County, New York; Fresno County, California; and San Joaquin County, California, supporting organizations like Reach Out and Read in the Bronx to promote literacy and well-being. The foundation also partners with Boys \\u0026 Girls Clubs, providing grants for educational kits, books, and activities during challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic, and hosts annual baseball camps and ProCamps to teach discipline, teamwork, and fundamentals to hundreds of children. Additional efforts encompass the Aaron Judge Book Club for literacy promotion, the #Just5Minutes Campaign for family engagement, and the #ICANHELP program for digital citizenship and leadership skills.\n\nIn recognition of his philanthropic impact, Judge received the 2023 Roberto Clemente Award from Major League Baseball for his exemplary community service, including foundation work and support for underserved youth. During the 2020 COVID-19 crisis, he contributed to relief efforts by participating in the All-In Challenge fundraiser, offering experiences like Yankees game tickets to support meals for frontline workers, children, and the elderly. Judge's commitment draws from his own adoption story, motivating him to aid children in need and build supportive environments in underserved communities.\n\n### Endorsements and business\n\nAaron Judge has secured several high-profile endorsement deals throughout his career, leveraging his status as a New York Yankees star to partner with major brands. In August 2023, he signed a multiyear endorsement contract with Nike's Jordan Brand, becoming the fifth active MLB player to represent the label and aligning with other athletes like Mookie Betts. This deal includes custom Air Jordan cleats, such as the Air Jordan 4 \"White Cement\" baseball cleat released in July 2025. Judge also maintains longstanding partnerships with Nike, appearing in their apparel campaigns as a prominent baseball endorser. In May 2025, Judge starred in Ralph Lauren's campaign for the new men's fragrance Polo 67 Eau de Parfum.\n\nBeyond footwear and apparel, Judge serves as a spokesperson for Pepsi, a role he assumed through a multi-year endorsement agreement signed in November 2017 that covers Pepsi, Diet Pepsi, and Pepsi Zero Sugar brands. He has featured in multiple Pepsi ad campaigns, including promotions launched in April 2018 that highlighted his on-field excitement to appeal to younger audiences. Additional endorsements include deals with JBL for audio products and Hulu for streaming services, contributing to his diverse portfolio of commercial partnerships.\n\nJudge's endorsement earnings have grown significantly, reaching an estimated $8 million annually as of 2025, placing him second among MLB players behind Shohei Ohtani. These off-field income streams complement his role in the Yankees' marketing efforts, where he is a central figure in team promotions and fan engagement initiatives. In terms of business ventures, Judge has explored investments in startups, including a stake in the energy drink company A SHOC (Accelerator Active Energy) as part of a $29 million Series B funding round in 2022.\n\n### Media appearances\n\nAaron Judge has made several notable appearances in television and other media, often highlighting his personality and contributions to baseball. He first gained widespread attention through guest spots on popular shows, including multiple visits to *The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon*. In 2017, Judge surprised Yankees fans in a segment where he posed as a reporter asking their opinions on \"Aaron Judge,\" leading to humorous reactions as many did not recognize him. He returned in 2021 alongside Robinson Canó to photobomb unsuspecting fans at Yankee Stadium, and in 2022, he and host Jimmy Fallon disguised themselves to prank shoppers at an MLB store. In 2023, Judge discussed his nine-year contract extension with the Yankees, advice from Derek Jeter, and participated in a \"Blow Your Mind\" game segment.\n\nJudge has also featured prominently on ESPN programming, contributing to the network's baseball coverage. He joined *First Take* in 2017 to reflect on the Yankees' season and his MVP predictions. ESPN's *SportsCenter* has regularly profiled his performances, such as a 2025 segment analyzing his early-season dominance. Additionally, he appeared in a 2017 episode of ESPN's *Sport Science*, which examined his exceptional power and bat speed through biomechanical analysis.\n\nIn documentaries and specials, Judge has been the subject of focused narratives on his career milestones. The 2022 ESPN+ documentary *Chasing History: The Summer of Aaron Judge* chronicled his pursuit of the American League home run record, featuring behind-the-scenes footage of the pressure and excitement. MLB Network produced specials like \"Judge Makes History: A Breakdown\" in 2022, dissecting his record-breaking 62nd home run, and ongoing segments such as Albert Pujols analyzing his swing mechanics in 2025.\n\nBeyond traditional media, Judge has engaged in interactive and digital formats. He served as the cover athlete for the 2018 video game *MLB The Show 18*, capitalizing on his breakout rookie year with 52 home runs. In podcasts, he guest-hosted or appeared on episodes discussing his career, including a 2024 spot on *Casa De Klub* with Corey Kluber, where he shared insights on pitching matchups and team dynamics. He also joined a 2022 offseason interview on *Talkin' Yanks*, addressing the MLB lockout and his future in the sport.\n\nJudge's media presence has significantly amplified baseball's visibility, particularly during his 2022 home run chase, which drew extensive coverage across networks and social media. Viral moments, such as a young fan returning one of his home run balls in exchange for memorabilia, captured national attention and underscored his approachable image. The pursuit of Roger Maris's 61-year-old AL record generated daily updates on ESPN, MLB Network, and other outlets, culminating in widespread celebration of his 62nd homer and contributing to a surge in MLB viewership that season.\n\n## Personal life\n\n### Family and relationships\n\nAaron Judge was adopted two days after his birth on April 26, 1992, by Patty and Wayne Judge, who raised him in Linden, California. Judge, who is biracial, learned of his adoption around age 10 after asking his parents why he did not look like them, and they explained the situation supportively. Patty, a retired physical education teacher and gym instructor, and Wayne, also a retired PE teacher, emphasized the importance of education, hard work, and community involvement in their household. The couple had previously adopted an older son, John Judge, who pursued a career in teaching, including English instruction in South Korea, and shares a close bond with Aaron despite maintaining a low public profile. Judge has credited his parents with instilling core values that influenced his career decisions, such as prioritizing academics alongside athletics during his youth.\n\nIn December 2021, Judge married his longtime partner, Samantha Bracksieck, in a private ceremony at the Montage Kapalua Bay Resort in Maui, Hawaii. The couple first met as teenagers at Linden High School and later attended California State University, Fresno, together, where Bracksieck earned a master's degree in kinesiology, receiving an award for her thesis on elbow injuries in Major League Baseball pitchers. Bracksieck maintains a background in sports science and actively supports Judge's philanthropic efforts through the All Rise Foundation, though she keeps a relatively private career focused on family and community work.\n\nJudge and Bracksieck welcomed their first child, daughter Nora Rose Judge, on January 27, 2025. The family remains notably private, rarely sharing personal details publicly, but Judge's relatives have provided consistent support, often attending pivotal games such as his record-breaking home run moments in 2022. This familial presence has been a key pillar in his professional journey, offering emotional grounding amid the demands of Major League Baseball.\n\n### Uniform number and preferences\n\nAaron Judge has worn uniform number 99 since his time in Triple-A with the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders, a choice he carried into Major League Baseball upon his debut with the New York Yankees in 2016. The Yankees assigned him the number during spring training that year, and Judge noted that it simply \"stuck with me a little bit\" as he progressed through his rookie season. In the context of the Yankees' storied numbering tradition, which typically reserves single-digit numbers for established stars, Judge's selection of 99 stands out as unconventional yet fitting for his imposing 6-foot-7 frame and explosive power at the plate.\n\nThe number has evolved into a symbol of Judge's dominance, with fans strongly associating 99 with his record-breaking home runs and larger-than-life presence, including his American League-record 62 homers in 2022. Despite athletes' common superstitions around equipment and numbers, Judge has maintained 99 without alteration, embracing it as emblematic of his unique physical stature and on-field identity.\n\nRegarding gear preferences, Judge uses a custom-fitted Rawlings Mach batting helmet, extended with a jaw flap for added protection suited to his size. He wears Nike Jordan brand cleats, often customized for special occasions like Players Weekend or the All-Star Game, providing the traction needed for his dynamic outfield play and base running. For his bat, Judge swings a Chandler AJ99.2 maple model measuring 35 inches in length and weighing 33 ounces—one of the heaviest and longest in use among MLB players—to maximize his leverage and power. These choices remain consistent, underscoring his preference for equipment that complements his exceptional build without succumbing to frequent changes.",
