# Narendra Modi

Narendra Damodardas Modi (born 17 September 1950) is an Indian politician serving as the 14th and current Prime Minister of India since 26 May 2014, leading the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to electoral victories in 2014, 2019, and 2024. Previously, he was Chief Minister of Gujarat from 7 October 2001 to 22 May 2014, during which the state pursued business-friendly policies contributing to industrialization and sustained economic expansion, though debates persist on whether growth accelerated beyond pre-existing trends.  

Modi's national leadership has emphasized structural economic reforms, including the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in 2017 to unify India's indirect tax system and foster a single market, alongside the 2016 demonetization of high-value currency notes aimed at reducing black money circulation and expanding the tax base, which spurred a rise in tax filings despite short-term disruptions. His "Make in India" initiative, launched in 2014, sought to elevate manufacturing's GDP share and generate employment through eased regulations and foreign investment incentives. Under his tenure, India's GDP has roughly doubled in nominal terms from approximately $2 trillion in 2014 to over $4.1 trillion by 2025, positioning it as the world's fifth-largest economy and among the fastest-growing major economies, with real GDP growth averaging around 6.5% annually amid global challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic.

A defining controversy from his Gujarat tenure involves the 2002 riots following the Godhra train burning, which resulted in over a thousand deaths, predominantly Muslim; Modi faced allegations of complicity or inaction, but a Supreme Court-appointed Special Investigation Team (SIT) granted him a clean chit in 2012, a verdict upheld by the court in 2022, dismissing claims of a larger conspiracy as unsubstantiated despite persistent narratives in segments of the media and opposition. Critics, often from ideologically aligned institutions, have highlighted perceived authoritarian tendencies and media influence, yet empirical measures of democratic backsliding remain contested, with Modi's governments securing repeated mandates through direct elections. His administration has also advanced infrastructure development, digital governance via platforms like UPI, and a foreign policy balancing relations with major powers including the US, Russia, and Israel, while prioritizing national security against threats like cross-border terrorism.
## Early life

### Childhood and family background

Narendra Damodardas Modi was born on 17 September 1950 in Vadnagar, a small town in Mehsana district of Gujarat, India, to Damodardas Mulchand Modi and Hiraben Modi. He was the third of six children in the family, which included elder brother Somabhai, younger brothers Prahlad, Pankaj, and Arvind, and sister Vasantiben.  The Modis belonged to the Ghanchi community, traditionally involved in oil pressing and small-scale trade, and the family resided in a modest single-room tenement near a temple, reflecting their humble socioeconomic circumstances.

Damodardas Modi, born around 1915 and deceased in 1989, operated a tea stall at Vadnagar railway station alongside a small grocery shop, supplementing the family's income through these ventures.  Hiraben Modi, born circa 1923 and passing away on 30 December 2022 at age 99, managed the household and endured personal hardships from her own early life, including migration and limited resources, which shaped the family's resilient ethos.  As a child, Modi assisted his father at the tea stall, serving passengers and contributing to household earnings, an experience he later described as instilling discipline and awareness of economic realities in a resource-constrained environment.

The family's living conditions were austere, with Modi recounting a childhood in a small, windowless house shared by all members, underscoring the everyday challenges of rural Gujarat's lower-middle strata during the post-independence era. This backdrop of modest origins, without inherited wealth or political connections, contrasted with the upward mobility Modi achieved through personal initiative, as evidenced by consistent accounts from official narratives and family details.

### Education and formative influences

Modi completed his early education in Vadnagar, Gujarat, attending local schools including a government institution that later served as a model for development initiatives. He finished higher secondary schooling there in 1967 while assisting his family at their tea stall near the railway station, experiences that instilled early lessons in self-reliance and hard work.

For higher education, Modi pursued a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science through the distance learning program at Delhi University's School of Open Learning, completing it in 1978. He later obtained a Master of Arts degree in political science from Gujarat University in 1983 as an external student, graduating with first-class honors. These qualifications, declared in his election affidavits, have faced scrutiny from critics alleging discrepancies in records or issuance processes, though Indian courts have ruled such details as personal information exempt from mandatory public disclosure by the universities involved.

Modi's formative influences were profoundly shaped by his immersion in the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) from childhood, joining local shakhas for physical training and ideological instruction that emphasized national service and cultural rootedness. As a young pracharak, he undertook extensive travels across India starting around age 17, wandering on foot, bicycle, and later motorcycle to remote areas, including tribal regions and the Himalayas, where he visited ashrams and engaged with diverse communities to broaden his understanding of India's social fabric. These journeys, inspired partly by Swami Vivekananda's teachings on self-discovery and national revival, reinforced a commitment to grassroots organization over formal academia.

Key RSS mentors, such as Lakshmanrao Inamdar, played pivotal roles in guiding Modi's development, fostering discipline and a "nation-first" ethos that Modi has credited with providing lifelong purpose amid his modest origins. This organizational grounding, rather than elite institutional networks, directed his early focus toward ideological work and public service, setting the trajectory for his political ascent.

## Political beginnings

### Involvement with RSS

Narendra Modi began associating with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a Hindu nationalist volunteer organization founded in 1925 to promote cultural and national discipline through daily shakhas (branches), during his childhood in Vadnagar, Gujarat. By 1971–1972, following the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, he committed to full-time service as an RSS pracharak (full-time propagator), dedicating himself to organizational work in Gujarat with a rigorous schedule starting at 5 a.m. and extending late into the night.

As a pracharak, Modi focused on expanding RSS activities, including recruitment, training swayamsevaks (volunteers), and strengthening local units. In 1978, he was appointed sambhag pracharak (regional organizer) for South Gujarat, overseeing operations in areas like Surat and Vadodara, where he coordinated shakha growth and ideological dissemination amid post-Emergency revival efforts. His work emphasized self-reliance, physical training, and Hindu cultural revival, aligning with RSS principles of character-building for national strength.

During the 1975–1977 Emergency imposed by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, when the RSS was banned as part of a crackdown on opposition groups, Modi, then in his mid-20s, evaded arrest and operated underground to sustain resistance. Disguised variously as a monk, Sikh, or seller, he coordinated covert meetings, distributed anti-Emergency literature, wrote RSS publications under pseudonyms to counter censorship, and aided families of imprisoned swayamsevaks, rising to general secretary roles in Gujarat units. These efforts contributed to the RSS's survival and the broader Janata Party coalition's 1977 electoral victory against the Congress government.

Modi's RSS tenure, spanning over a decade of grassroots mobilization, culminated in 1985 when the organization deputed him to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), its political affiliate, to bolster electoral organization in Gujarat. Throughout his pracharak phase, he internalized RSS ideology emphasizing national unity, anti-corruption, and cultural assertion, which informed his later political strategies.

### Rise in BJP and early organizational roles

Modi joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in 1987, taking up the position of Organization Secretary for its Gujarat unit. In this role, he managed the party's grassroots expansion and electoral strategies, beginning with the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation elections that year, where the BJP achieved its first win in the body. He also participated in L.K. Advani's Nyay Yatra in 1987 to highlight issues affecting the poor and organized the Lok Shakti Yatra in 1989.

In the 1990 Gujarat Legislative Assembly elections, Modi's organizational efforts helped the BJP secure 67 seats out of 182, positioning it as a major opposition force. That September, as Gujarat BJP's general secretary, he coordinated local mobilization for Advani's Somnath-Ayodhya Ram Rath Yatra, which aimed to rally support for the Ram Janmabhoomi movement and boosted the party's visibility.

Modi's election management proved pivotal in the 1995 Gujarat Assembly polls, where the BJP won 121 seats—a majority—allowing it to form the state government for the first time. This success, marked by an increased vote share over prior contests, underscored his ability to build cadre strength and voter outreach in Gujarat.

Elevated to national secretary of the BJP in October 1995, Modi oversaw party operations in states such as Haryana and Himachal Pradesh. In 1998, he advanced to national general secretary (organization), coordinating nationwide campaigns that contributed to the BJP-led coalition's formation of government after the Lok Sabha elections. He retained this role until October 2001, focusing on internal discipline and electoral planning amid the party's growth from a marginal entity to a dominant national player.

## Chief Minister of Gujarat (2001–2014)

### Ascension to office and initial governance

Narendra Modi was sworn in as Chief Minister of Gujarat on October 7, 2001, succeeding Keshubhai Patel in a decision by the Bharatiya Janata Party central leadership.  Patel had resigned citing deteriorating health, amid mounting pressure from poor administrative performance, including allegations of corruption and a botched response to the January 2001 Bhuj earthquake.  The appointment tasked the unelected Modi, a long-time party organizer without prior ministerial experience, with stabilizing the BJP government and gearing up for the December 2002 assembly elections.

The state Modi inherited was still grappling with the aftermath of the magnitude 7.7 earthquake on January 26, 2001, which killed over 13,000 people, injured 167,000, and rendered hundreds of thousands homeless, with Kutch district suffering the heaviest damage including the near-total destruction of Bhuj city.  Criticism of Patel's administration centered on delays in relief distribution, inadequate coordination, and failure to prevent disease outbreaks in camps, exacerbating public discontent.  Modi prioritized reconstruction, establishing special economic zones in Kutch to draw private investment for housing and infrastructure, which facilitated the repair or rebuilding of over 1 million homes using seismically resistant designs. 

In his early tenure, Modi reoriented governance toward efficiency, cracking down on bureaucratic inertia responsible for reconstruction delays and auctioning personal items to fund girl child education initiatives. These steps, combined with streamlined aid disbursement, contributed to Kutch's economic revival, evidenced by post-earthquake poverty reductions in the district despite the disaster's severity. By 2003, Gujarat pioneered the State Disaster Management Act, creating institutional mechanisms for risk mitigation that influenced national policy. This period laid the groundwork for Modi's development-oriented approach, transforming crisis response into long-term growth catalysts while preparing the BJP for electoral success in 2002.

### 2002 Gujarat riots: Events, response, and legal outcomes

The 2002 Gujarat riots were precipitated by the Godhra train burning on February 27, 2002, when coach S/6 of the Sabarmati Express, carrying Hindu pilgrims and kar sevaks returning from Ayodhya, was set ablaze near Godhra station, killing 59 passengers, including 27 women and 10 children.  A trial court convicted 11 individuals of conspiracy and murder in 2011, sentencing them to death (later commuted to life by the Gujarat High Court in 2017), establishing the incident as a premeditated attack by a Muslim mob.

Violence erupted across Gujarat on February 28, 2002, primarily targeting Muslim communities in retaliatory attacks by Hindu mobs, with the worst incidents in Ahmedabad, including the Naroda Patiya massacre (97 Muslims killed) and the Gulberg Society killings (69 deaths, including former Congress MP Ehsan Jafri). Official government figures released in 2005 reported a total death toll of 1,044, comprising 790 Muslims and 254 Hindus, alongside over 200,000 displaced and widespread property destruction. The riots subsided by mid-March after sustained security measures, though sporadic violence persisted.

The Gujarat government under Chief Minister Narendra Modi imposed curfews in affected areas, deployed state police, and requested army assistance on February 28, 2002, with troops arriving and conducting flag marches the same day. Modi publicly stated that every effort was made to control the "riots resulting from the Godhra outrage," emphasizing restoration of order. While some accounts, including from retired Lt. Gen. Zameer Uddin Shah, alleged delays in civil administration providing transport to the army, the Supreme Court-appointed Special Investigation Team (SIT) concluded the request was timely and logistics issues were not attributable to deliberate inaction by state authorities.

Legal proceedings included the Nanavati-Mehta Commission, which in 2019 gave Modi a clean chit, finding no evidence of state complicity and affirming prompt army deployment. The SIT, monitored by the Supreme Court, investigated allegations against Modi and officials, closing cases in 2012 with no charges, a decision upheld by the Supreme Court in 2022 when it dismissed Zakia Jafri's (Ehsan Jafri's widow) petition alleging a "larger conspiracy," ruling the claims lacked material evidence after exhaustive probe.  

In riot-related trials, outcomes varied: 32 were convicted in the Naroda Patiya case (11 life sentences upheld), 11 in the Godhra train case, and 11 in the Bilkis Bano gang-rape and murder case (life terms, remanded to jail by Supreme Court in 2024 after premature release). However, numerous acquittals occurred due to insufficient evidence, including 69 in the Tarsali riots case (2023) and others in high-profile incidents, reflecting challenges in witness reliability and forensic proof amid communal tensions.  No court has found Modi personally liable for abetment or failure to act.

### Economic reforms and development achievements

Under Modi's tenure as Chief Minister, Gujarat's economy exhibited sustained high growth, with the state's gross state domestic product (GSDP) expanding at an average annual rate of approximately 10% from 2004-05 to 2011-12, outpacing the national average of around 7.9% during the same period. This performance contributed to Gujarat's share of India's national GDP rising from 6.4% at the start of his term to 8.1% by 2014. The growth was driven by policies emphasizing industrialization, infrastructure development, and investor-friendly measures, though analyses indicate that much of the acceleration traced back to liberalization trends from the 1990s rather than unique post-2001 reforms.

Key reforms included the Jyotigram Yojana launched in 2003, which separated agricultural and non-agricultural power feeders, providing 24-hour electricity to villages and 8 hours of reliable supply to farms, significantly reducing transmission losses from over 40% to around 20% by 2006. This initiative, funded partly through metered supply to industries, enhanced agricultural productivity and industrial reliability, positioning Gujarat as a leader in power sector efficiency among Indian states. Complementary infrastructure investments expanded road networks, with the Gujarat State Road Transport Corporation modernizing fleets and highways, and port development, including the Mundra Port becoming India's largest private port by 2010, facilitating trade and logistics.

The Vibrant Gujarat Global Investors' Summits, initiated in 2003, attracted substantial investment commitments, with the inaugural event securing MoUs worth Rs 66,068 crore from over 200 participants, laying groundwork for subsequent editions that by 2013 had cumulatively drawn pledges exceeding Rs 39 lakh crore.  These summits promoted single-window clearances and policy incentives, boosting sectors like manufacturing and chemicals, though realization rates varied, with critics noting that not all pledges materialized into ground-level projects.

In agriculture, efforts focused on irrigation expansion, including accelerating the Sardar Sarovar Dam project, which by 2014 had irrigated over 1.8 million hectares, contributing to higher crop yields and rural electrification under integrated schemes. Gujarat's per capita income rose from Rs 24,486 in 2001-02 to Rs 1,02,000 by 2013-14, reflecting broad-based gains in manufacturing and services, though disparities persisted in rural wages relative to urban sectors. These achievements established the "Gujarat Model" as a template for pro-business governance, emphasizing minimal bureaucracy and rapid project execution.

### Criticisms and debates on governance

Critics have debated the inclusivity of Modi's economic governance in Gujarat, arguing that while the state achieved high gross state domestic product (GSDP) growth rates averaging 10.3% annually from 2004-05 to 2011-12—exceeding the national average—the benefits disproportionately favored urban elites and large corporations rather than broad-based development. Rural poverty remained at 26.7% and urban at 17.9% as of 2011-12, placing Gujarat mid-tier among Indian states in poverty reduction, with only an 8.6% decline between 1993-94 and 2009-10 compared to higher rates in states like Himachal Pradesh (13.4%).  Economists such as those analyzing National Sample Survey data have noted that Gujarat's performance in human development indicators, including literacy and malnutrition rates, lagged behind comparably growing states, attributing this to policies prioritizing industrial incentives over social welfare investments.

Allegations of crony capitalism have centered on initiatives like the Vibrant Gujarat summits, launched in 2003, which attracted commitments exceeding $400 billion in investments by 2013 but were accused of favoring select conglomerates through land allotments and policy favors, including early ties with Gautam Adani, who pledged $15 billion at the inaugural event. Academic analyses describe this as extending pre-existing pro-business policies into a model of "unequal development," where neoliberal reforms intertwined with political favoritism exacerbated income disparities, with Gujarat's Gini coefficient rising during Modi's tenure.  Defenders counter that such summits boosted manufacturing's share of GSDP from 13.7% in 2000-01 to 16.3% by 2011-12, creating jobs, though empirical studies question the realized investment quantum, estimating actual inflows at under 10% of pledges. 

Environmental governance drew scrutiny for prioritizing rapid industrialization, leading to documented degradation in coastal and riverine areas; for instance, special economic zones (SEZs) approved under Modi displaced over 100,000 farmers and fishers by 2010, with minimal rehabilitation, while untreated industrial effluents contaminated the Sabarmati River, reducing its dissolved oxygen to near zero in stretches. Gujarat's air quality worsened, with particulate matter levels in industrial hubs like Vapi exceeding national standards by 200% in 2010, per Central Pollution Control Board data, amid relaxed enforcement to attract investors. Critics, including reports from non-governmental organizations, link this to a "blind race" toward growth, though state officials maintained that pre-2001 patterns of lax regulation persisted and that Modi-era policies included some green initiatives, such as solar projects, without reversing overall trends.

Agrarian distress persisted, with farmer suicides averaging 1,200 annually in the mid-2000s, driven by indebtedness and drought—Gujarat reported over 600 cases in 2008-09 alone, per Supreme Court-noted NGO petitions—despite irrigation expansions like the Sardar Sarovar Dam, which irrigated only 20% of promised land by 2010 due to delays and uneven distribution favoring cash crops. Government data showed cotton-dependent suicides spiking post-2002 Bt cotton adoption, though broader socioeconomic factors like crop price volatility and limited credit access were cited over biotechnology alone in econometric studies. Debates highlight that while Gujarat's agricultural growth rate reached 9.6% annually from 2004-05 to 2011-12, smallholders benefited less than large mechanized farms, reflecting policy emphasis on agro-industries over subsistence support. These issues, often amplified by opposition-aligned media, underscore tensions between Modi's pro-growth agenda and demands for equitable resource allocation, with empirical evidence confirming accelerated urbanization at the expense of rural equity.

## Path to Prime Ministership

### 2014 general election campaign and landslide victory

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) formally named Narendra Modi as its prime ministerial candidate on September 13, 2013, positioning him as the central figure against the incumbent United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government led by the Indian National Congress. The campaign capitalized on widespread dissatisfaction with the UPA's decade in power, marked by economic stagnation, high inflation averaging 8-10% annually from 2010-2013, and major corruption scandals such as the 2G spectrum allocation and coal block allocations, which the Comptroller and Auditor General estimated caused losses exceeding ₹1.76 lakh crore. Modi's narrative emphasized the "Gujarat model" of governance, highlighting rapid economic growth rates of 10%+ in Gujarat during his chief ministership, infrastructure development, and investor-friendly policies as a blueprint for national revival.

The BJP's strategy, orchestrated by Amit Shah as election in-charge, involved an unprecedented Modi-centric approach, including over 400 rallies, extensive use of social media reaching millions via the NaMo app launched in 2014, and innovative "Chai pe Charcha" interactive sessions simulating tea-stall discussions to engage youth and urban voters. Holographic 3D projection technology enabled Modi to address multiple rallies simultaneously, covering remote areas efficiently. The manifesto, released on April 7, 2014, outlined 600+ promises under themes like "Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas" (development for all), pledging "Achhe Din" (good days) through anti-corruption measures such as a unified tax system precursor to GST, repatriation of black money estimated at $500 billion abroad, and economic reforms for job creation targeting 10 million annually. It also committed to minimum government intervention, agricultural doubling of income goals, and healthcare expansion via insurance coverage for all.

Polling occurred in nine phases from April 7 to May 12, 2014, across 543 constituencies with a record turnout of 66.4%, reflecting heightened voter enthusiasm. Results announced on May 16 delivered a landslide: the BJP secured 282 seats with 31.0% vote share, achieving the first single-party parliamentary majority since 1984 without relying on post-poll alliances for government formation, while the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) totaled 336 seats. The Congress plummeted to 44 seats with 19.3% votes, decimated by anti-incumbency. Modi contested and won from Varanasi by a margin of 371,784 votes, symbolizing his transition to national leadership. This outcome stemmed from the BJP's superior grassroots mobilization, Modi's personal appeal as a decisive outsider to Delhi's elite politics, and the first-past-the-post system's amplification of the party's concentrated support in key states like Uttar Pradesh (73 seats) and Maharashtra. Despite the modest national vote share, the victory underscored causal factors like UPA's policy paralysis and Modi's proven administrative track record, overriding concerns from some international media about his 2002 Gujarat riots role, which Indian courts had cleared him of culpability in subsequent investigations.

### 2019 reelection amid economic challenges

The 2019 Indian general elections occurred in seven phases from April 11 to May 19, with results declared on May 23, yielding a decisive victory for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which secured 303 seats in the 543-member Lok Sabha, up from 282 in 2014, while the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) coalition amassed 353 seats.  This outcome defied widespread economic distress, including a GDP growth deceleration to 6.8% for fiscal year 2018-19 from 8.2% the prior year, amid implementation frictions from 2016 demonetization and 2017 goods and services tax rollout.

Unemployment emerged as a acute concern, with a leaked government Periodic Labour Force Survey indicating a 6.1% rate for 2017-18—the highest in 45 years—which the administration withheld ahead of polling, fueling perceptions of job scarcity despite promises of 20 million annual positions. Rural distress compounded by falling agricultural incomes and non-performing loans in banking sectors further strained public sentiment, yet Modi's reelection reflected voter prioritization of alternative narratives over economic metrics.

The February 14 Pulwama suicide bombing, which killed 40 Central Reserve Police Force personnel in a Jaish-e-Mohammed attack, and India's subsequent February 26 Balakot airstrike on terrorist camps in Pakistan shifted campaign dynamics toward national security, bolstering Modi's image as a resolute leader against cross-border threats. This pivot, alongside sustained welfare measures like direct benefit transfers and opposition disarray—evident in the Indian National Congress's mere 52 seats—enabled BJP consolidation of Hindu-majority support and marginalization of economic critiques. Analysts note Modi's personal charisma and organizational prowess as key, with empirical vote shares rising to 37.4% for BJP from 31.3% in 2014, underscoring causal weight of security signaling over fiscal underperformance in electoral calculus.

### 2024 election: Coalition dynamics and third term

The 2024 Indian general election, conducted in seven phases from April 19 to June 1, saw the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) secure 240 seats in the 543-member Lok Sabha, falling short of the 272 needed for an outright majority. The National Democratic Alliance (NDA), led by the BJP, collectively won 293 seats, enabling it to form a government. This marked a departure from the BJP's previous single-party majorities in 2014 and 2019, necessitating reliance on coalition partners for stability.

Key NDA allies included the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) with 16 seats, primarily from Andhra Pradesh, and Janata Dal (United) (JD(U)) with 12 seats from Bihar. Post-election negotiations involved concessions such as cabinet positions and policy accommodations; TDP leader Chandrababu Naidu secured key portfolios for his party, including civil aviation, while JD(U) leader Nitish Kumar obtained the railways ministry. Both parties, known for past alliances and ruptures with the BJP, emphasized demands like special category status for their states—Andhra Pradesh for TDP and Bihar for JD(U)—highlighting regional priorities over national agendas.

Narendra Modi was unanimously endorsed as prime minister by the NDA on June 7, 2024, and sworn in for his third term on June 9, with a cabinet comprising 30 members, including 7 from allied parties. The coalition's formation underscored a return to pre-2014 coalition-era dynamics, where allies could influence fiscal federalism and legislative priorities, potentially moderating the BJP's more assertive policies on issues like economic reforms or social legislation. Despite the BJP's reduced dominance, the NDA's majority ensured continuity in Modi's leadership, though with greater emphasis on consensus-building to maintain alliance cohesion. Analysts noted that the TDP and JD(U)'s dependence on central funds and fear of internal splits reinforced their alignment with the BJP, limiting overt challenges to Modi's authority.

## Prime Ministership (2014–present)

### Economic policies: Reforms, growth, and data-driven outcomes

Upon assuming office in 2014, the Modi government prioritized structural economic reforms to enhance efficiency, attract investment, and formalize the economy. Key initiatives included the launch of "Make in India" on September 25, 2014, aimed at boosting manufacturing and FDI inflows, which rose 119% to USD 667 billion over the subsequent decade compared to the prior period. The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), enacted in May 2016, streamlined resolution of non-performing assets (NPAs), leading to improved recovery rates for banks and a reduction in gross NPAs from peaks above 11% in 2018 to around 3-5% by 2024, though liquidation occurred in over 30% of resolved cases.

The Goods and Services Tax (GST), implemented on July 1, 2017, unified indirect taxes, fostering formalization and tax compliance; empirical studies indicate a positive long-run impact on GDP growth, with revenue collections supporting fiscal expansion despite initial disruptions. Demonetization on November 8, 2016, invalidated 86% of currency in circulation to curb black money and counterfeiting, but it caused a temporary GDP growth slowdown from 8.3% in FY2016 to 6.8% in FY2017, alongside short-term liquidity shocks affecting informal sectors.

India's GDP expanded from USD 1.86 trillion in 2014 to an estimated USD 3.89 trillion in 2025, reflecting nominal growth of over 100%, though real annual rates averaged around 6-7% pre-COVID, dipping to -6.6% in FY2021 before rebounding to 8.2% in FY2022 and stabilizing at 6.5-7.4% in FY2025. Reforms contributed to India's World Bank Ease of Doing Business ranking improving from 142nd in 2014 to 63rd in 2020, driven by simplified business registration and electricity access, though the index was discontinued amid methodology critiques.

| Fiscal Year | Real GDP Growth (%) |
|-------------|---------------------|
| 2014-15    | 7.4                |
| 2015-16    | 8.0                |
| 2016-17    | 6.8                |
| 2017-18    | 6.5                |
| 2018-19    | 6.5                |
| 2019-20    | 3.9                |
| 2020-21    | -6.6               |
| 2021-22    | 8.7                |
| 2022-23    | 7.0                |
| 2023-24    | 8.2                |
| 2024-25 (est.) | 6.5           |

Despite growth, challenges persisted; unemployment rates, per CMIE data, hovered at 6-8% through 2025, with urban rates often higher and youth unemployment exceeding 20% in periods, attributed partly to structural shifts and post-reform formalization pains rather than policy failure alone. FDI in manufacturing under Make in India grew 69% to USD 165.1 billion from 2014-2024, yet manufacturing's GDP share remained below 17%, falling short of 25% targets due to global supply chain dynamics and domestic skill gaps. Overall, policies emphasized supply-side enhancements and digital integration, yielding sustained recovery post-2020, with IMF projecting 6.2-6.3% growth for 2025-2026.

### Social welfare, health, and infrastructure initiatives

The Modi government launched the Swachh Bharat Mission on October 2, 2014, aiming to achieve open defecation-free status across India by constructing toilets in rural and urban areas. By 2019, the mission had built over 100 million toilets, increasing rural sanitation coverage from approximately 39% in 2014 to nearly 100%, thereby impacting the lives of around 500 million people and reducing open defecation rates significantly.

Under the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, initiated on May 1, 2016, the government distributed free LPG connections to women from below-poverty-line households to reduce reliance on traditional fuels and improve household health. The scheme provided over 10 crore connections by 2024, with expansions including 2.5 million additional free connections announced during Navratri 2025, enhancing clean cooking access for rural poor families.

The Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, launched in June 2015, targeted affordable housing for urban and rural poor, sanctioning over 1.12 crore urban houses by 2024 under PMAY-U 2.0, with more than 93 lakh completed and delivered to beneficiaries. Rural components under PMAY-G have similarly constructed millions of homes, though challenges like unoccupied units—nearly 47% of 9.7 lakh urban PMAY houses in some reports—highlight implementation variances across states.

In health, the Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PM-JAY), rolled out on September 23, 2018, offers up to ₹5 lakh annual coverage per family for secondary and tertiary care to over 500 million vulnerable citizens, marking the world's largest government-funded health assurance program. By 2024, it had empanelled thousands of hospitals and processed millions of claims, though studies note mixed impacts on out-of-pocket expenses, with some beneficiaries facing 19% higher non-medical costs compared to non-enrollees.

Infrastructure efforts include the Bharatmala Pariyojana, approved in October 2017, which has awarded projects for 26,425 km of highways, with 19,826 km constructed by February 2025, expanding national highway length from 91,287 km in 2014 to over 146,000 km by 2024 and laying up to 37 km of new roads daily. Airport infrastructure has also doubled, with operational airports rising from 74 in 2014 to 157 by 2024, supported by investments exceeding ₹96,000 crore in aviation from FY 2019-20 to 2024-25.

### Foreign policy: Strategic partnerships and global positioning

Modi's foreign policy emphasizes strategic autonomy through multi-alignment, diverging from India's traditional non-alignment by prioritizing pragmatic partnerships that advance economic growth, defense capabilities, and regional influence. Key pillars include "Neighborhood First," which seeks to bolster ties with South Asian nations via infrastructure aid and diplomacy, though strained by cross-border terrorism from Pakistan and the 2020 Galwan Valley clash with China that resulted in over 20 Indian soldier deaths. The "Act East" policy, upgraded from "Look East" in 2014, has deepened engagement with ASEAN through elevated summits, trade pacts aiming for $200 billion in bilateral trade by 2025, and joint military exercises like the annual ASEAN-India Maritime Exercise launched in 2023.

In the Indo-Pacific, Modi revived the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (QUAD) with the US, Japan, and Australia, focusing on maritime security, supply chain resilience, and countering Chinese expansionism; the 2024 Quad Leaders' Summit advanced initiatives in clean energy manufacturing and space data sharing via a new working group. The US-India partnership, formalized as a Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership, includes the Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology (iCET) for semiconductor and AI collaboration, with bilateral trade reaching $190 billion in 2023 and defense co-production deals like GE-HAL jet engines.

Relations with Russia remain robust despite Western sanctions post-Ukraine invasion, anchored in defense procurement—India operates 60% Russian-origin equipment—and energy imports exceeding 40% of its crude oil needs in 2024 at discounted rates, enabling deals like the $5.4 billion S-400 system deliveries completed in 2021 and discussions for additional missile batteries worth $1.2 billion as of 2025. Nuclear cooperation advanced with agreements for six more reactors in 2024, alongside joint ventures in helicopters and BrahMos missiles. Ties with Israel have expanded into a multifaceted alliance, highlighted by Modi's 2017 visit—the first by an Indian PM—yielding defense imports like $2 billion in Spike missiles and Heron drones, plus agricultural tech transfers amid shared counter-terrorism interests.

Modi's global positioning leverages forums like the 2023 G20 presidency, where India hosted 200 events across 60 cities, secured the African Union's permanent membership, and brokered a consensus declaration on sustainable development despite Ukraine divisions, amplifying India's role as a Global South bridge-builder. Initiatives such as the International Solar Alliance, co-launched with France in 2015 and joined by 120 countries by 2025, underscore renewable energy diplomacy, while vaccine Maitri exported 66 million COVID-19 doses to 95 nations in 2021, enhancing soft power without aligning in great-power rivalries. This pragmatic stance—evident in simultaneous QUAD-BRICS engagement—prioritizes India's security and economic interests, though critics note risks from over-reliance on discounted Russian oil amid US pressure for diversification.

### National security and defense advancements

Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration, India conducted cross-border surgical strikes on September 29, 2016, targeting terrorist launch pads in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir following the Uri army base attack that killed 19 Indian soldiers, establishing a policy of proactive retaliation against state-sponsored terrorism. This was followed by the Balakot airstrike on February 26, 2019, where Indian Air Force jets struck a Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist camp in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in response to the Pulwama attack that claimed 40 Central Reserve Police Force personnel, signaling that India would no longer limit responses to sub-conventional levels and deterring further large-scale infiltrations.  These operations, verified through official briefings and satellite imagery analysis, marked a doctrinal shift from strategic restraint to calibrated deterrence, with subsequent data showing a temporary dip in cross-border firing incidents along the Line of Control.

The abrogation of Article 370 on August 5, 2019, integrated Jammu and Kashmir more fully into India's legal framework, correlating with a sharp decline in terrorist incidents: encounters dropped from 1,086 in 2010–2018 to 199 in 2023, stone-pelting cases fell over 90%, and civilian fatalities decreased by 73% compared to pre-abrogation levels, attributed to enhanced intelligence integration and reduced local radicalization.  Internal security operations dismantled networks like Indian Mujahideen and curbed Naxalite activities, with overall terror-related deaths in affected areas falling 50% from 2014 to 2023, supported by data from official security assessments rather than anecdotal reports. 

Defense modernization emphasized self-reliance, with indigenous production rising 174% to ₹1.27 lakh crore by 2025 and exports surging 34-fold to ₹23,622 crore in 2024–25, enabling sales to over 100 countries via platforms like BrahMos missiles and Akash systems.  The Agnipath scheme, introduced in June 2022, recruits youth for four-year terms to maintain a younger, fitter force profile—reducing the average age from 32 to 26 years—while reserving 25% for permanent service, addressing pension liabilities projected to consume 50% of the defense budget by 2040 without such reforms.  Reforms included establishing Chief of Defence Staff in 2019 for jointness and Integrated Theatre Commands by 2024, alongside bans on 4,664 import items to boost private sector involvement.

In response to the 2020 Galwan Valley clash with China, which killed 20 Indian soldiers, the government accelerated border infrastructure, completing 90 projects worth ₹8,000 crore along the Line of Actual Control by 2023, including the 255-km Darbuk-Shyok-Daulat Beg Oldie road to counter Chinese salami-slicing tactics.  Disengagement agreements at friction points like Pangong Lake by 2021 preserved territorial status quo, while military deployments increased threefold in Ladakh, enhancing deterrence without escalation to full conflict. These measures, grounded in empirical border patrol data, shifted India's posture from reactive to assertive, reducing vulnerability to incursions documented in pre-2014 satellite surveys.

### Cultural and Hindutva policies: Temple restorations and national identity

The Modi administration has emphasized the restoration and development of Hindu temples as part of broader cultural policies, positioning these efforts as a reclamation of India's indigenous heritage from periods of historical neglect and foreign rule. Key initiatives include court-sanctioned reconstructions and infrastructure enhancements at major pilgrimage sites, with funding allocated through government schemes like PRASAD (Pilgrimage Rejuvenation and Spiritual Heritage Augmentation Drive), which disbursed over ₹4,000 crore for temple-related projects by 2023. These policies align with Hindutva principles, which advocate for Hindu cultural nationalism as foundational to Indian identity, emphasizing continuity from ancient Vedic traditions rather than syncretic or secular interpretations imposed post-independence.

A flagship project is the Ram Temple in Ayodhya, constructed on the site of the demolished Babri Masjid following the Supreme Court's November 9, 2019, ruling that awarded the 2.77-acre disputed land to a trust for the temple while allocating alternate land for a mosque. Prime Minister Modi laid the foundation stone on August 5, 2020, during a ceremony attended by over 175 dignitaries, and performed the pran pratishtha (consecration) of the idol on January 22, 2024, declaring it a symbol of India's "civilizational resurgence" after centuries of struggle. The temple complex, spanning 70 acres and built at an estimated cost of ₹1,800 crore through public donations, features a 366-ton granite idol and is designed to accommodate 50,000 devotees daily, boosting local tourism revenue to ₹85,000 crore in Ayodhya within the first year post-inauguration. Proponents, including BJP leaders, argue this fulfills a long-standing Hindu claim backed by archaeological evidence of a pre-existing temple structure, reinforcing national identity rooted in Ramayana epics as a unifying cultural narrative.

In Varanasi, Modi's parliamentary constituency, the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor project, initiated in 2019 and inaugurated by him on December 13, 2021, expanded the temple premises from 3,000 to 5 lakh square feet at a cost of ₹700 crore, demolishing over 40 encroaching structures to create a 400-meter pathway linking the Vishwanath Temple to the Ganges ghats. This development, which included relocating 43 families with compensation, has increased pilgrim footfall by 300% and generated ₹1,200 crore in annual economic activity by 2023, according to Uttar Pradesh tourism data. Modi described it as restoring the temple's original grandeur, diminished during Mughal-era encroachments, thereby linking personal devotion—rooted in his Varanasi representation since 2014—with a national imperative to preserve Shaivite heritage as emblematic of India's spiritual sovereignty.

Additional restorations under Modi's oversight include the Mahakal Lok Corridor in Ujjain, inaugurated in October 2022 after ₹850 crore investment, which illuminated 70 heritage sites and enhanced accessibility for the Mahashivratri festival drawing 1.5 crore visitors; the Kedarnath Temple reconstruction post-2013 floods, completed in 2019 with Modi overseeing phases; and the Pavagadh Kalika Mata Temple revitalization in Gujarat, where he hoisted a flag in September 2025 symbolizing reclaimed Hindu sites. These efforts, coordinated via the Ministry of Culture, extend to international projects like the $4.2 million Hoysaleswara Temple restoration in Karnataka-inspired overseas aid in 2019, underscoring a policy of global Hindu diaspora engagement. Critics from secular perspectives, such as in Western analyses, contend these prioritize Hindu symbols over minority sites, potentially eroding constitutional pluralism, but empirical metrics show sustained public support, with 71% of Indians in a 2023 Pew survey affirming pride in ancient cultural heritage as central to identity. In Modi's framing, such policies counter colonial-era distortions by empirically evidencing pre-Islamic temple layers through excavations, fostering a causal link between heritage revival and cohesive national self-perception beyond imported ideologies.

### Environmental and sustainability efforts

Modi's administration has prioritized environmental initiatives emphasizing sanitation, river rejuvenation, renewable energy expansion, and afforestation, often framed through global platforms like the International Solar Alliance and LiFE (Lifestyle for Environment). These efforts align with India's commitments under the Paris Agreement, including a pledge for net-zero emissions by 2070 announced by Modi at COP26 in Glasgow on November 1, 2021. Despite rapid progress in capacity building, challenges persist, such as uneven implementation and ongoing pollution pressures from urbanization and industry.

The Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, launched by Modi on October 2, 2014, targeted universal sanitation to eliminate open defecation, constructing over 12 crore household toilets by 2024 and declaring more than 6 lakh villages open-defecation-free (ODF) by 2019. Phase 2 of the mission, extended to 2024-25 with a budget of Rs. 7,192 crore, focuses on ODF Plus status, including waste management, with over 5.87 lakh villages achieving it by September 2024; public participation in Swachhata Hi Seva 2024 exceeded 17 crore people across 19.70 lakh programs.

Namami Gange, initiated in 2015 with Rs. 20,000 crore allocated, aims to clean the Ganga River through sewage treatment, afforestation, and biodiversity restoration; by March 2025, over 300 projects were completed, including 127 sewage infrastructure works creating substantial treatment capacity, though only 69% of funds were utilized by 2024-25 per independent analysis. River surface cleaning and front development have reduced pollution in stretches like Varanasi, with 30,000 hectares afforested for aquifer recharge.

Renewable energy capacity surged under Modi's tenure, with solar installations rising from 2.82 GW in March 2014 to 107.9 GW by June 2025—a 4,000% increase—and total renewables reaching 227 GW by July 2025, including wind capacity doubling to 47.3 GW. This growth supports India's 500 GW non-fossil target by 2030, bolstered by the International Solar Alliance, co-founded by Modi and French President Hollande on November 30, 2015, to mobilize $1 trillion in solar investments by 2030 across 121 member countries.

Afforestation drives, including the Green India Mission launched in 2014 and the 2023 'Ek Ped Maa Ke Naam' campaign, have planted crores of trees, contributing to India's forest cover expansion and its rise to 9th globally in total forest area as of 2025; the mission targets 24.7 million hectares restoration by 2030, with net gains outweighing losses from 1990-2025. Complementary wildlife efforts, such as Project Cheetah reintroduction and Tiger@2047, enhance biodiversity conservation. LiFE, introduced by Modi at COP26, promotes sustainable lifestyles to complement infrastructure-led sustainability.

### Institutional reforms: Anti-corruption, federalism, and judicial interactions

Modi's government pursued anti-corruption measures through demonetization on November 8, 2016, which invalidated 86% of India's circulating currency notes to target black money, counterfeit currency, and terror financing, though economic disruptions followed and black money recovery fell short of expectations. The initiative aligned with Modi's campaign promises against corruption, leading to increased digital transactions and formalization of the economy, with UPI transactions surging from 1.2 billion in FY2017 to over 13 billion by FY2023. Complementary efforts included Aadhaar-linked Direct Benefit Transfers (DBT), which by 2022 had transferred over Rs 25 lakh crore in subsidies, saving an estimated Rs 2.2 lakh crore by reducing leakages through biometric authentication and bank account seeding.

Amendments to the Prevention of Corruption Act in 2018 expedited trials for public servants accused of bribery, imposing time-bound investigations and protecting honest officials from frivolous probes, while enhancing penalties for bribe-givers. Enforcement agencies like the Enforcement Directorate saw a rise in cases, attaching assets worth Rs 1 lakh crore between 2014 and 2023 related to money laundering, though critics argue selective targeting of opposition figures undermined impartiality.

On federalism, the government emphasized "cooperative federalism" via the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime, launched on July 1, 2017, which unified indirect taxes under a federal GST Council comprising the Union Finance Minister and state representatives with voting rights weighted to ensure state consensus on rates and exemptions. This structure facilitated decisions like rate rationalizations, with the Council meeting over 50 times by 2025 to address revenue-sharing disputes, contributing to states' GST collections rising from Rs 4.4 lakh crore in FY2018 to Rs 20.5 lakh crore in FY2024.

The NITI Aayog's Governing Council, chaired by Modi, convened chief ministers for policy coordination, as in the February 2021 meeting focusing on post-COVID recovery and Aspirational Districts Programme, replacing the centralized Planning Commission to foster state-led development. Despite these mechanisms, tensions arose over fiscal devolution, with opposition states claiming shortfalls in GST compensation during the pandemic, though the Centre released Rs 2.7 lakh crore in advances by 2022 to bridge gaps.

Judicial interactions involved attempts to reform appointments via the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC) Act of August 2014, which proposed a balanced panel including the Chief Justice, executive representatives, and eminent persons to select judges, aiming to curb collegium opacity. The Supreme Court struck down NJAC on October 16, 2015, ruling it undermined judicial primacy, reverting to the collegium system and prompting ongoing executive-judiciary friction over delays in appointments, with over 100 high court vacancies persisting as of 2023.

Subsequent efforts included fast-tracking infrastructure courts and the 2023 Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita replacing colonial-era laws, but government delays in clearing collegium recommendations, such as in 2018-2019, led to accusations of executive overreach, while the judiciary criticized delays in tribunal appointments under new laws. Modi revived NJAC discussions in 2022 parliamentary debates, advocating a "middle path" for transparency without eroding independence, amid broader reforms like increasing judge strength to 50 per million population by 2030.

### Major controversies: CAA, farm laws, and minority rights debates

The Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), enacted on December 11, 2019, amended the 1955 Citizenship Act to expedite naturalization for non-Muslim migrants—specifically Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis, and Christians—from Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan who entered India before December 31, 2014, and faced religious persecution there.  The government's rationale emphasized protection for religious minorities fleeing Islamic states, without altering citizenship eligibility for Indian Muslims or revoking existing citizenships. Critics, including opposition parties and international observers, argued it institutionalized religious discrimination by excluding Muslims, potentially enabling a nationwide National Register of Citizens (NRC) to disproportionately target them. Nationwide protests erupted immediately after passage, escalating into violence; in Uttar Pradesh alone, at least 21 deaths occurred amid clashes, with over 1,100 arrests and 5,558 preventive detentions reported. Delhi witnessed severe riots in February 2020, resulting in 53 fatalities, predominantly Muslims, alongside property destruction and police actions. Estimates of total protest-related deaths ranged up to 83 across states, though official figures varied. The Supreme Court received over 200 petitions challenging the law's constitutionality, suspending implementation until rules were notified on March 11, 2024, allowing applications but facing ongoing legal scrutiny.

In September 2020, Parliament passed three agricultural reform bills—the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act—initially via ordinances to deregulate markets, enable direct farmer-corporate contracts, and remove stock limits on staples, aiming to boost efficiency and reduce middlemen dependency.  Primarily Punjab and Haryana farmers, organized under unions like the Samyukta Kisan Morcha, protested from November 2020, blockading Delhi borders for 359 days, fearing erosion of minimum support prices (MSP), corporate monopolization, and land loss risks despite government assurances of MSP continuity.  Clashes, including the January 2021 Red Fort incident, led to injuries and deaths; farmer groups claimed over 700 fatalities from weather, suicides, and confrontations, while official tallies were lower, with compensation offered in some cases like 500,000 rupees per family for verified protest deaths.  The Supreme Court stayed implementation in January 2021, forming a negotiation committee, but protests persisted until Prime Minister Modi announced repeal on November 19, 2021, formalized by Parliament on November 29, citing sustained opposition ahead of state elections despite multiple dialogue rounds. 

Minority rights debates under Modi's tenure intensified around CAA's perceived exclusion of Muslims, fueling narratives of systemic marginalization, though empirical indicators like the Muslim population share rising from 14.2% in 2001 to an estimated 15% by 2011 (with higher fertility rates persisting) contradict claims of existential threat. Policies such as the 2019 Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act criminalizing triple talaq were defended as empowering women against regressive practices, yet criticized by some Muslim bodies as interference despite surveys showing intra-community support. State-level anti-conversion laws in BJP-ruled areas aimed to curb coerced marriages but drew accusations of targeting interfaith unions, with isolated vigilante incidents amplified by media despite National Crime Records Bureau data showing no surge in religion-motivated crimes proportional to population. Government schemes like Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana and Ujjwala Yojana extended benefits to Muslim households, with participation rates reflecting outreach efforts, though socioeconomic gaps from pre-2014 persisted per periodic labor force surveys. International reports from outlets like Human Rights Watch highlighted harassment, but these often rely on anecdotal evidence amid acknowledged left-leaning institutional biases exaggerating Hindu-Muslim tensions for narrative purposes, while official data underscores welfare universality over targeted discrimination.

### Crisis management: COVID-19, border tensions, and internal security operations

Modi directed the imposition of a nationwide lockdown on March 24, 2020, affecting over 1.3 billion people, following a 14-hour voluntary Janata Curfew on March 22, 2020, as an initial measure to contain COVID-19 transmission. The 21-day initial phase, later extended in stages until May 31, 2020, drastically reduced mobility and helped flatten the early curve of infections, with empirical analyses indicating significant control over case growth rates during the lockdown periods. However, the abrupt implementation disrupted supply chains, migrant worker movements, and non-COVID healthcare, contributing to increased morbidity and mortality from other causes, such as chronic conditions.

To bolster immunity and response, Modi launched the world's largest vaccination campaign on January 16, 2021, prioritizing healthcare workers before expanding to the general population aged 18 and above from May 1, 2021. By October 21, 2021, India had administered 1 billion doses, reaching over 2 billion by July 2022, leveraging indigenous vaccines like Covaxin and Covishield through public-private partnerships and digital platforms like CoWIN. Despite a severe second wave in April-May 2021 driven by the Delta variant, with over 400,000 daily cases at peak, the drive achieved high coverage, averting an estimated substantial number of severe cases and yielding net economic savings from reduced infections.

In managing border tensions, Modi oversaw responses to Chinese military buildups in eastern Ladakh from April 2020, culminating in the Galwan Valley clash on June 15-16, 2020, where hand-to-hand combat killed 20 Indian soldiers and an undisclosed number of Chinese troops. On June 19, 2020, Modi asserted that Indian territory remained uncompromised, with no Chinese incursions or post captures, emphasizing military dominance and resolve to protect sovereignty. His administration pursued de-escalation through 20 rounds of corps commander talks alongside infrastructure and troop reinforcements, securing phased disengagements in areas like Pangong Lake by February 2021 and a border patrolling agreement on October 21, 2024, to restore pre-2020 status quo in Depsang and Demchok.

For internal security, Modi's government authorized cross-border surgical strikes on September 29, 2016, targeting terrorist launch pads in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir following the Uri attack on September 18, 2016, which claimed 19 Indian soldiers' lives, as detailed in a joint Ministry of External Affairs and Defence briefing. This operation neutralized several terrorists and marked a doctrinal shift toward pre-emptive action against Pakistan-sponsored infiltration. Similarly, after the Pulwama suicide bombing on February 14, 2019, killing 40 CRPF personnel, Indian Air Force Mirage 2000 jets struck a Jaish-e-Mohammed camp in Balakot on February 26, 2019, aiming to dismantle training facilities and deter future attacks. These calibrated responses, coupled with enhanced intelligence and border fencing, reduced infiltration attempts, with the Army reporting nearly 20 foiled bids in 2016 alone.

### Recent developments (2024–2025): Post-election governance and ongoing reforms

Following the 2024 general elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) secured 240 seats in the Lok Sabha, falling short of a majority but enabling the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) coalition to form the government with 293 seats. Narendra Modi was sworn in as Prime Minister for a third consecutive term on June 9, 2024, marking the first such instance for a non-Congress leader. This outcome introduced coalition constraints, requiring negotiations with allies such as the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and Janata Dal (United) (JD(U)) on issues like special status for Andhra Pradesh and Bihar, potentially slowing ambitious reforms. 

Post-election governance emphasized policy continuity amid moderated reform pace, with the Union Budget 2024-25 prioritizing employment generation through initiatives like a scheme for one crore youth internships over five years and skilling programs targeting 4.1 crore youth. Fiscal consolidation continued, aiming for a deficit reduction to 4.9% of GDP in 2024-25 from 5.6% prior, supporting infrastructure spending exceeding ₹11 lakh crore. Defense allocations rose to ₹6.81 lakh crore for 2025-26, reflecting sustained focus on modernization and self-reliance under Atmanirbhar Bharat.

Ongoing reforms included incremental steps in taxation and manufacturing, such as proposed GST rationalization to simplify slabs and enhance compliance, though land and labor code implementations faced delays due to coalition dynamics.  The Waqf (Amendment) Act, introduced in 2025, mandated digitization of records and greater transparency in property management to curb encroachments, addressing long-standing governance issues in waqf boards. Banking sector cleanup persisted, with non-performing assets dropping to 2.5% by September 2025 from peaks over 10% pre-2014, attributed to recapitalization and resolution mechanisms.

Challenges persisted in job creation and rural distress, with unemployment remaining a key concern despite GDP growth projections of 6.5-7% for 2025, as structural shifts toward manufacturing via Production Linked Incentive schemes aimed to rival global competitors but required allied consensus for deeper labor flexibility.  Governance efforts also advanced "One Nation, One Election" through a high-level committee report in 2024, proposing simultaneous polls to reduce costs and disruptions, though full implementation awaited constitutional amendments. These measures underscored a pragmatic approach to Viksit Bharat goals by 2047, balancing ideological priorities with empirical economic imperatives.

## Public perception and legacy

### Approval ratings and empirical public support metrics

Narendra Modi's approval ratings have remained consistently high throughout his tenure as Prime Minister, reflecting sustained public support amid economic growth, infrastructure development, and national security achievements. Domestic polls conducted by Ipsos IndiaBus have shown approval levels fluctuating between 68% and 75% in recent years, with a rating of 70% recorded in November 2024 based on surveys of over 2,000 respondents assessing performance in areas like education, cleanliness, and healthcare. In February 2024, prior to the general elections, the same pollster reported a peak of 75%, which dipped slightly to 70% in May 2024 and 68% in March 2025, with stronger backing from northern and western India as well as higher ratings from women compared to men.

International trackers corroborate this domestic strength, positioning Modi among the world's most approved democratic leaders. Morning Consult's Global Leader Approval Rating, drawing from nationally representative samples in India, placed Modi's approval at 75% in July 2025, the highest globally, attributed to factors including GDP growth exceeding 6% and welfare initiatives. By September 2025, it stood at 71%, maintaining a lead over other leaders despite post-2024 election adjustments. These figures, updated through early October 2025, indicate resilience even as some surveys like India Today's Mood of the Nation noted a plateau in personal popularity alongside a dip in NDA coalition satisfaction.

Electoral outcomes provide empirical metrics of public support, with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) under Modi's leadership securing decisive victories in 2014 (336 National Democratic Alliance seats) and 2019 (353 seats), demonstrating broad voter endorsement. In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP obtained 240 seats with a 36.56% vote share—marginally lower than 37.36% in 2019—yet formed government with NDA allies totaling 293 seats, enabling Modi's third term on June 9, 2024. This result, amid opposition consolidation, underscores enduring appeal, particularly in Hindi heartland states, where BJP retained majorities.

| Pollster | Date Range | Approval Rating (%) | Key Notes |
|----------|------------|---------------------|-----------|
| Ipsos IndiaBus | November 2024 | 70 | Steady from May/August 2024; strong on infrastructure |
| Morning Consult | July 2025 | 75 | Highest among democratic leaders; tied to economic metrics |
| Ipsos IndiaBus | March 2025 | 68 | Regional strength in North/West; women \u003e men |
| Morning Consult | September 2025 | 71 | Continued global lead despite domestic coalition dynamics |

Critics, including outlets with perceived oppositional leanings, have highlighted potential long-term declines in some metrics like C-Voter's Mood of the Nation surveys, which noted reduced satisfaction post-2024; however, these coexist with polls affirming overall stability, suggesting methodological variances or focus on coalition rather than personal support. Such discrepancies underscore the need to weigh multiple data points, prioritizing nationally representative samples over ideologically inclined interpretations.

### Media narratives: Domestic and international portrayals

Domestic media coverage of Narendra Modi remains sharply polarized along ideological lines, with pro-government outlets emphasizing his achievements in economic growth, infrastructure development, and national security, while opposition-aligned channels highlight alleged authoritarian tendencies and policy failures. Channels like Republic TV and Zee News frequently portray Modi as a decisive leader who transformed Gujarat's economy during his tenure as chief minister from 2001 to 2014, citing GDP growth rates averaging over 10% annually in the state post-2002. In contrast, outlets such as NDTV and The Wire focus on controversies like the 2002 Gujarat riots, where over 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, died following the Godhra train burning, accusing Modi of complicity despite his acquittal by India's Supreme Court-appointed Special Investigation Team in 2012, which found no evidence of state orchestration. This divide has intensified perceptions of bias, with a 2022 survey indicating that 46% of Indians following media believe coverage of Modi is biased, often portraying his government more negatively than warranted.

Critics of domestic media, including international observers, argue that Modi's administration has exerted pressure on outlets through regulatory actions, advertiser influence, and tax raids, leading to a decline in press freedom rankings from 140th in 2014 to 159th out of 180 countries by 2024 according to Reporters Without Borders. The government's 2023 tax raids on the BBC offices followed the broadcaster's documentary alleging Modi's role in the 2002 riots, which Indian officials dismissed as propaganda pushing a "discredited narrative" rooted in a colonial mindset.  Proponents counter that such measures target foreign entities amplifying unsubstantiated claims, noting Modi's repeated judicial clearances on riot-related charges, including a 2022 Supreme Court rejection of a plea to revisit the investigation. This dynamic reflects broader institutional biases in Indian journalism, where left-leaning urban elites dominate narrative framing, often prioritizing minority rights critiques over empirical metrics like Modi's sustained public approval above 60% in multiple polls since 2014.

Internationally, Western media narratives frequently depict Modi as a polarizing figure emblematic of democratic backsliding and Hindu majoritarianism, with outlets like The New York Times and BBC emphasizing erosion of minority protections and media curbs under his tenure since 2014. Coverage of policies such as the 2019 Citizenship Amendment Act, which fast-tracks citizenship for non-Muslim refugees from neighboring countries, is often framed as discriminatory against Muslims, despite data showing no mass disenfranchisement and Modi's defense of it as addressing religious persecution. The 2023 BBC documentary "India: The Modi Question" revived Gujarat riots scrutiny, prompting Indian rebuttals that it ignored court exonerations and relied on partisan testimonies, contributing to blocked screenings in India.  Such portrayals align with systemic left-leaning biases in global journalism, which amplify critiques of non-Western conservative leaders while downplaying comparable issues elsewhere, as evidenced by heightened scrutiny during India's 2024 elections despite Modi's coalition securing 293 seats.

Positive international coverage, though less dominant, praises Modi's economic reforms, including the 2016 demonetization aimed at curbing black money—despite short-term disruptions, it led to formalized banking with 500 million new accounts by 2020—and initiatives like Make in India, which attracted $500 billion in foreign direct investment from 2014 to 2023. Leaders and media in Israel, UAE, and the US under Trump highlighted Modi's pragmatic diplomacy, such as the 2017 "Howdy Modi" event drawing 50,000 attendees, framing him as a strategic partner against extremism. However, outlets like The Guardian and HBO's Last Week Tonight have critiqued his Hindu nationalist roots in the RSS, portraying policies on temple restorations or cow protection as eroding secularism, often without contextualizing their basis in majority cultural restoration post-colonial secular impositions. This selective focus underscores a causal disconnect from ground realities, where Modi's third-term mandate in June 2024 reflects robust electoral validation amid these narratives.

### Cultural influence and historical assessments

Narendra Modi proposed the establishment of International Day of Yoga during his address to the United Nations General Assembly on September 27, 2014, leading to its formal recognition by the UN on December 11, 2014, with June 21 designated annually to promote yoga's benefits for physical and mental well-being. Under Modi's leadership, mass yoga events have been organized globally, including at UN headquarters in New York on June 21, 2023, where he led participants, positioning yoga as a cornerstone of India's soft power diplomacy. This initiative has contributed to increased international adoption of yoga, with Modi emphasizing its roots in ancient Indian traditions as a tool for holistic health amid modern stressors.

Modi's cultural diplomacy extends to the revival of India's heritage sites and traditional knowledge systems, including the promotion of Ayurveda, naturopathy, and other AYUSH practices through the dedicated Ministry of AYUSH established in 2014. Efforts include the repatriation of over 300 ancient Indian artifacts from foreign museums between 2014 and 2025, alongside the development of new institutions like the Yuge Yugeen Bharat museum to showcase civilizational history. These measures have shifted focus from post-colonial narratives toward asserting indigenous cultural identity, with initiatives like the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor project integrating spiritual heritage with tourism infrastructure.

Globally, Modi's engagements have amplified Indian cultural exports, such as classical dance, music, and festivals, evidenced by rising interest in events like Diwali celebrations in Italy, Holi in Canada, and Sanskrit studies in Russia as of August 2025. Under the Act East Policy, cultural outreach via Buddhism and shared heritage has strengthened ties with Asian nations, including temple restorations in Nepal and heritage dialogues in Southeast Asia. Domestically, policies have encouraged the integration of Indian philosophical traditions into education and public life, fostering a narrative of civilizational continuity.

Historical assessments portray Modi as a pivotal figure in India's cultural renaissance, credited with redefining national identity around ancient heritage rather than secular or colonial frameworks, as articulated in analyses of his tenure from 2014 to 2025. Supporters highlight empirical gains in global cultural visibility and domestic pride, such as increased tourist footfall at heritage sites post-2014 restorations, attributing this to causal links between policy prioritization and institutional funding. Critics, often from Western media outlets with documented ideological leanings toward multiculturalism, argue that Modi's emphasis on Hindu traditions has exacerbated social divisions, though such claims frequently rely on anecdotal communal incidents without disaggregating baseline trends in religious harmony metrics. Balanced evaluations, drawing from diplomatic records, affirm his role in leveraging culture for strategic autonomy, with Asia-focused cultural initiatives yielding measurable diplomatic dividends like enhanced people-to-people ties.

## Personal aspects

### Family life and personal philosophy

Narendra Modi was born on September 17, 1950, in Vadnagar, Gujarat, to Damodardas Mulchand Modi, a tea stall owner, and Hiraben Modi, a homemaker who passed away in December 2022. As the third of six children, his siblings include sisters Soma Modi and Vasantiben Hasmukhlal Modi, and brothers Amrit Modi, Prahlad Modi, and Pankaj Modi, most of whom have maintained low public profiles with professions in government service or retirement. Modi's early life involved assisting his father at the tea stall, reflecting the family's modest circumstances in the Ghanchi community.  

In 1968, at age 18, Modi entered an arranged marriage with Jashodaben Chimanlal, a union rooted in traditional Ghanchi caste customs, but the couple separated shortly thereafter without cohabitation or children, as Modi prioritized organizational work. He publicly acknowledged the marriage in his 2014 election affidavit, marking the first official disclosure after decades of separation. This choice aligned with his commitment to a life of public service, forgoing conventional family roles.  

Modi adheres to a disciplined personal routine, maintaining a strict vegetarian diet, abstaining from alcohol and tobacco, and fasting periodically, such as during Navratri. He practices yoga daily, including pranayama, surya namaskar, and meditation for at least 40 minutes each morning, emphasizing physical and mental resilience as core to his fitness at age 75.  

His personal philosophy centers on selfless service and national dedication, profoundly shaped by early involvement with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), which he joined at age 8 and served as a full-time pracharak, instilling values of purpose-driven action and organizational discipline. Modi cites Swami Vivekananda's teachings on self-reliance, spirituality, and karma yoga as foundational influences, viewing them as cornerstones for his outlook on life and governance, prioritizing societal upliftment over personal gain. This ethos manifests in his renunciation of family life for broader service, embodying a commitment to collective welfare through disciplined effort.

### Writings, speeches, and intellectual contributions

Narendra Modi has authored several books in Gujarati and Hindi, primarily drawing from his experiences in organizational work and public service. His first book, *Sangharsh Ma Gujarat*, published in 1978, chronicles the underground resistance in Gujarat against the Emergency regime imposed from June 1975 to March 1977, detailing clandestine operations and public mobilization efforts led by RSS activists. In 2008, he released *Jyotipunj*, a compilation of essays profiling 27 RSS pracharaks, including extended coverage of M.S. Golwalkar, emphasizing their dedication to nation-building and selfless service as models for societal transformation. Another work, *Exam Warriors* (2016), targets schoolchildren with practical advice on overcoming exam anxiety through yoga, time management, and a positive outlook, reflecting Modi's focus on holistic education.

Modi's speeches form a significant part of his public engagement, often delivered in Hindi to connect directly with diverse audiences. The monthly radio program *Mann Ki Baat*, initiated on 3 October 2014, allows him to address citizens on topics ranging from policy updates to individual success stories, with over 120 episodes by 2025 promoting initiatives like digital literacy and environmental conservation. Annual addresses from the Red Fort on Independence Day, such as the 2020 speech amid the COVID-19 pandemic, outline economic reforms, infrastructure goals, and calls for national unity, consistently reaching hundreds of millions via broadcast and digital platforms. Internationally, his 8 June 2016 address to the joint session of the US Congress highlighted mutual democratic commitments and counter-terrorism cooperation, while the 23 June 2023 speech reiterated India's role in global stability.

Intellectually, Modi's contributions emphasize a synthesis of economic pragmatism and cultural nationalism, influenced by RSS thinkers like Golwalkar and Deendayal Upadhyaya. In speeches, he promotes "Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas" (together with all, development for all), a framework for inclusive growth that integrates market reforms with social equity, as articulated in multiple Red Fort addresses. Concepts like Atmanirbhar Bharat, launched in May 2020, advocate self-reliance through manufacturing boosts and supply chain diversification, grounded in empirical assessments of global disruptions. His oratory often invokes participatory governance, crediting citizen inputs for policy shifts, as seen in discussions of demographics, digital infrastructure, and delivery mechanisms driving India's growth trajectory. These ideas, disseminated via speeches and writings, prioritize causal links between institutional reforms and measurable outcomes like GDP expansion and poverty reduction.
