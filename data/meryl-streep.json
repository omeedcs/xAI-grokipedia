  "content": "# Meryl Streep\n\nMary Louise Streep (born June 22, 1949), professionally known as Meryl Streep, is an American actress distinguished by her exceptional range in portraying complex, multifaceted characters across theater, film, and television through precise vocal techniques, physical transformations, and mastery of diverse accents.\nStreep began her professional career on stage with the New York Shakespeare Festival in the early 1970s, transitioning to film with roles in *The Deer Hunter* (1978), which garnered her first Academy Award nomination, and *Kramer vs. Kramer* (1979), for which she won the Oscar for Best Actress in a Supporting Role.\nHolding the record for the most Academy Award nominations by any performer with 21, she secured two additional wins for Best Actress in *Sophie's Choice* (1982) and *The Iron Lady* (2011), alongside numerous other accolades including Golden Globes and Emmy Awards for her work in varied genres from historical dramas to contemporary comedies.\nHer portrayals, such as the Polish immigrant in *Sophie's Choice* requiring fluency in multiple languages and dialects, exemplify a commitment to authenticity that has defined her five-decade career, though some observers question the sustainability of her nomination frequency amid evolving industry standards.\nStreep married sculptor Don Gummer in 1978, and they raised four children—Henry, Mamie, Grace, and Louisa—before separating around 2017.\n\n## Early life\n\n### Family background and childhood\n\nMary Louise Streep was born on June 22, 1949, in Summit, New Jersey, the eldest child of Harry William Streep Jr., a pharmaceutical executive, and Mary Wolf Wilkinson, a commercial artist and former art editor. The family, of middle-class means, resided primarily in Bernardsville, New Jersey, where Streep spent her early years. Her father's career in pharmaceuticals reflected a pragmatic emphasis on stability, while her mother's artistic background introduced creative elements into the household.\n\nStreep has two younger brothers, Harry William Streep III (born 1951) and Dana David Streep (born 1953), both of whom later pursued acting careers. The siblings were raised in an environment where parents instilled values of education and self-reliance alongside exposure to arts and literature from a young age. Devoted parenting focused on building practical skills, though Streep's mother actively encouraged confidence and creative expression.\n\nAs a child, Streep was naturally introverted compared to her outgoing mother, often describing herself as reserved. This disposition began to shift through participation in school plays, where she discovered an early aptitude for performance and mimicry, gaining poise amid familial support for such pursuits without overemphasizing artistic vocations over vocational preparedness.\n\n### Education and early influences\n\nStreep attended Bernardsville High School in New Jersey, graduating in 1967, where she first nurtured her passion for performing arts through drama activities and cheerleading. Her high school experiences laid the groundwork for her artistic pursuits, emphasizing discipline and public performance.\n\nShe enrolled at Vassar College, earning a Bachelor of Arts in Drama in 1971, graduating cum laude. At Vassar, Streep studied under veteran actress Jean Arthur, whose guidance helped refine her approach to character interpretation and stage presence.\n\nSubsequently, Streep pursued advanced training at the Yale School of Drama, obtaining a Master of Fine Arts degree in 1975 with honors. To fund her studies, she worked as a waitress and typist. The program, led by dean Robert Brustein, immersed her in intensive ensemble work and classical repertoire, building foundational skills in versatility and technical precision.\n\nEarly on, Streep aspired to a career as an opera singer, drawing from a soprano voice inherited from her mother and honed through school recitals. This vocal training contributed to her acting methodology, particularly in mastering breath control and expressive range, reflecting a commitment to empirical skill development across disciplines.\n\n## Career beginnings\n\n### Theater training and debut roles\n\nFollowing her undergraduate studies at Vassar College, Streep pursued advanced theater training at the Yale School of Drama, where she earned a Master of Fine Arts degree in 1975 after appearing in more than 40 student productions alongside future notables such as John Lithgow and Henry Winkler.    \nStreep's professional stage debut occurred in 1975 as Imogen Parrot in the New York Shakespeare Festival's revival of *Trelawny of the 'Wells'* at Lincoln Center's Vivian Beaumont Theater.  In late 1975, she auditioned successfully for the Phoenix Theatre company, leading to her appearances in early 1976 in double-bill revivals: as Flora Meighan in Tennessee Williams's *27 Wagons Full of Cotton* and as a replacement in Arthur Miller's *A Memory of Two Mondays*, both at the Playhouse Theatre.    That summer, she performed Isabella in a Central Park production of Shakespeare's *Measure for Measure* at the Delacorte Theater.  \nIn 1977, Streep took on Dunyasha in Andrei Șerban's experimental revival of Anton Chekhov's *The Cherry Orchard* at the Vivian Beaumont Theater, a production noted for its unconventional staging that divided critics but highlighted her adaptability in ensemble roles.    Later that year, she made her Broadway musical debut as Lieutenant Lillian Holiday in Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill's *Happy End* at the Martin Beck Theatre, demonstrating her vocal versatility in a role requiring a tough, accented persona amid the show's satirical edge.    \nBy 1979, Streep starred as Andrea in Thomas Babe's *Taken in Marriage* at the Public Theater, portraying a bride-to-be in a dysfunctional family dynamic opposite Colleen Dewhurst; reviews praised her ability to convey layered emotional distress through subtle physicality and vocal shifts, evidencing her emerging command of character-driven realism.    These early roles underscored her technical proficiency in dialects, physical transformation, and ensemble interplay, honed from Yale's rigorous workshop environment and refined through New York's experimental theater scene.\n\n### Transition to film and television\n\nStreep's screen debut occurred in the television movie *The Deadliest Season* (1977), where she portrayed the wife of a professional hockey player grappling with aggression and personal turmoil.  This role marked her initial foray into the medium, leveraging her theater-honed skills in emotional depth and subtlety.\n\nHer transition to feature films began with a minor supporting part as Anne Marie, a gossipy Manhattan socialite, in *Julia* (1977), directed by Fred Zinnemann.  Streep's stage discipline from Yale Drama and Public Theater productions enabled a seamless adaptation to film's intimate close-ups, yielding a naturalistic presence that contrasted with more theatrical styles prevalent in earlier Hollywood eras. In *The Deer Hunter* (1978), she expanded her visibility as Linda, the fiancée of a Vietnam War soldier, contributing improvised dialogue that enhanced the character's quiet resilience amid trauma. \n\nThe NBC miniseries *Holocaust* (1978) solidified her television credibility, earning her the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited Series for her portrayal of a Jewish woman enduring Nazi persecution.  Contemporary reviews noted how her theater background fostered authentic, understated reactions suited to screen realism, avoiding overprojection. A small but assured role as the ex-wife Jill in Woody Allen's *Manhattan* (1979) demonstrated her versatility, countering potential typecasting as a purely dramatic performer by infusing wry humor into brief scenes.  Early career risks of being pigeonholed after intense roles like those in *Holocaust* and *The Deer Hunter* were mitigated through auditions for lighter parts, reflecting calculated diversification rooted in her training's emphasis on adaptability.\n\n## Film and television career\n\n### 1970s: Initial breakthroughs and critical establishment\n\nStreep's breakthrough in film came with her supporting role as Linda in *The Deer Hunter* (1978), directed by Michael Cimino, where she portrayed the devoted fiancée of a Vietnam-bound steelworker, navigating grief and loyalty amid the ensemble's focus on war's psychological toll. Her performance, delivered with understated emotional restraint rather than overt dramatics, contributed to the film's critical success and earned her first Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress, signaling her capacity for authentic vulnerability in group dynamics.\n\nIn 1979, Streep appeared in three films that solidified her reputation for nuanced depth: as the cerebral ex-wife Jill in Woody Allen's *Manhattan*, a brief but layered role depicting post-divorce reflection and quiet resolve; as the principled Louisiana lawyer Karen Traynor in the political drama *The Seduction of Joe Tynan*, opposite Alan Alda, which explored ambition's personal costs and grossed $19.6 million domestically despite modest commercial expectations. These roles showcased her versatility in restrained ensemble contexts, with critics noting her ability to convey inner conflict without dominating scenes, as in *Manhattan*'s limited screen time where she balanced intellect and subtle regret.\n\nHer portrayal of Joanna Kramer in *Kramer vs. Kramer* (1979), a dissatisfied wife who abandons her family before returning for a custody battle, represented the decade's pinnacle, earning universal praise for its raw emotional authenticity and culminating in the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress on April 1, 1980. Variety lauded the film's perceptive handling of familial dissolution, with Streep's courtroom testimony—largely improvised and rewritten by her—exemplifying causal realism in depicting a woman's pursuit of self-fulfillment over maternal convention, propelling her from obscurity to critical establishment despite the picture's focus on Dustin Hoffman's lead. This win, amid nominations for her other 1979 works, underscored how her emphasis on lived-in restraint, rather than histrionics, distinguished her in an era of ensemble supports.\n\n### 1980s: Versatility and dramatic peaks\n\nStreep's portrayal of Zofia \"Sophie\" Zawistowski in *Sophie's Choice* (1982), directed by Alan J. Pakula, marked a dramatic pinnacle, depicting a Polish Holocaust survivor grappling with profound trauma and moral dilemmas. Released on December 8, 1982, the film earned Streep the Academy Award for Best Actress at the 55th ceremony on April 11, 1983, along with a Golden Globe win for Best Actress in a Drama.  Her command of a Polish accent, achieved through phonetic precision and immersion, amplified the character's authenticity, as evidenced by critics' acclaim for the \"heart-wrenching\" delivery of the titular choice scene. The performance grossed $30 million domestically against a $9 million budget, reflecting strong audience resonance amid its emotional weight.\n\nIn *Silkwood* (1983), Streep embodied nuclear plant worker and whistleblower Karen Silkwood under Mike Nichols' direction, portraying her as a feisty, chain-smoking activist exposing safety violations. Released November 14, 1983, the role drew Oscar and Golden Globe nominations for Best Actress, highlighting Streep's replication of Silkwood's Oklahoma drawl and mannerisms via archival footage study.  The film, budgeted at $10 million, earned $11.7 million in North America, underscoring its basis in real events while Streep's transformation emphasized causal risks of industrial negligence over sensationalism.\n\nStreep extended her range into romance with *Out of Africa* (1985), as Danish baroness Karen Blixen managing a Kenyan coffee plantation, opposite Robert Redford. Directed by Sydney Pollack and released December 18, 1985, it secured her sixth Oscar nomination and a BAFTA Best Actress award, with her Danish-inflected English accent rooted in linguistic analysis for period accuracy. The $31 million production grossed $227 million worldwide, blending epic scope with intimate vulnerability. Later, *Heartburn* (1986), a Mike Nichols comedy-drama adapted from Nora Ephron's novel about marital betrayal, cast Streep as journalist Rachel Samstat alongside Jack Nicholson; released July 25, 1986, it received mixed reviews for its wry tone but affirmed her comedic agility in navigating infidelity's absurdities. In *Ironweed* (1987), she played spectral figure Annie opposite Nicholson's drifter, earning another Oscar nod in Héctor Babenco's Depression-era tale released December 18, 1987, where her ethereal physicality contrasted raw despair.\n\nThese roles exemplified Streep's decade-defining versatility, mastering accents through dialect coaching and physical alterations—like vocal strain for *Sophie's* anguish or posture shifts in *Silkwood*—to prioritize character causality over superficial traits, as her process involved dissecting behavioral motivations from primary sources. This technical rigor, evident in eight films from 1980-1989 yielding five Oscar nods, balanced dramatic intensity with broader appeal, grossing over $300 million collectively.\n\n### 1990s: Commercial challenges and character-driven roles\n\nStreep's films in the early 1990s experienced mixed commercial results, with *Defending Your Life* (1991) earning $16.4 million domestically on a modest budget, reflecting limited box office appeal despite positive reception for her comedic turn as an afterlife soulmate. Similarly, *Death Becomes Her* (1992), a special effects-heavy black comedy co-starring Goldie Hawn and Bruce Willis, grossed $58.4 million domestically against a $55 million production cost, underperforming expectations for a high-profile Universal release and failing to achieve blockbuster status. These outcomes highlighted broader industry challenges for lead-driven projects amid shifting audience preferences toward franchise-driven spectacles.\n\nIn contrast, *The Bridges of Madison County* (1995), directed by and co-starring Clint Eastwood, marked a significant commercial rebound, grossing $71.5 million domestically and $182 million worldwide on a $24 million budget, buoyed by strong word-of-mouth and critical acclaim for Streep's portrayal of a stifled Italian housewife in a fleeting affair. The film's success underscored Streep's enduring draw in character-centric dramas, though her output remained selective following the birth of her third child in 1991, prioritizing roles compatible with family commitments over high-volume productions. Later entries like *The River Wild* (1994), an action thriller netting $47 million domestically, further evidenced her pivot toward ensemble and supporting dynamics in mid-budget genre fare.\n\nBy the late 1990s, Streep gravitated toward intimate, awards-bait character studies, including *One True Thing* (1998), where her depiction of a dying matriarch battling cancer earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress amid praise for emotional authenticity, though the film grossed under $24 million domestically. *Dancing at Lughnasa* (1998), an adaptation of Brian Friel's play set in 1930s Ireland, featured her as the stern eldest sister in a struggling family, receiving mixed reviews and limited theatrical release with negligible box office impact. This period saw emerging critiques of her technique as occasionally over-mannered, with some observers noting a reliance on accents and studied gestures that could overshadow raw vulnerability, a view echoed in broader assessments of her precision-driven style.\n\n### 2000s: Resurgence with broad appeal\n\nIn 2002, Streep portrayed real-life journalist Susan Orlean in *Adaptation.*, a meta-comedy directed by Spike Jonze that earned critical acclaim for its inventive screenplay but generated $32.8 million worldwide on a $19 million budget. Later that year, she played Clarissa Vaughan in *The Hours*, an ensemble drama adapted from Michael Cunningham's novel, which explored themes of mental health across generations and amassed approximately $97 million globally. These roles demonstrated Streep's continued dramatic range amid modest commercial returns compared to her earlier peaks.\n\nStreep achieved a commercial breakthrough in 2006 with *The Devil Wears Prada*, where she embodied the imperious fashion editor Miranda Priestly in a satirical comedy inspired by Anna Wintour's world; the film grossed $326 million worldwide against a $35 million budget, signaling her pivot toward roles with mass-market draw. For this performance, she won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy in 2007. The success reflected industry trends favoring accessible narratives over the character-driven arthouse fare that had defined her 1990s output, allowing broader audience engagement without sacrificing acclaim.\n\nBy 2008, Streep starred as Donna Sheridan in *Mamma Mia!*, a jukebox musical adaptation of the ABBA stage hit, which became her highest-grossing film to date at $610 million worldwide on a $52 million budget, driven by its feel-good escapism and global fanbase. That same year, she returned to intensity as the suspicious nun Sister Aloysius Beauvier in *Doubt*, a tense drama co-starring Philip Seymour Hoffman, earning her 16th Academy Award nomination for Best Actress in 2009; the film earned $51.7 million worldwide. Streep closed the decade with *Julie \\u0026 Julia* (2009), portraying culinary icon Julia Child in a dual-biopic comedy that blended whimsy and authenticity, grossing $129.5 million globally and highlighting her adeptness at lighter, character-centric vehicles appealing to diverse demographics.\n\nThis period marked Streep's strategic adaptation to Hollywood's emphasis on profitability, blending comedic flair with proven dramatic chops to expand her appeal beyond prestige cinema, as evidenced by the escalating box office figures from *Prada* onward.\n\n### 2010s: Experimentation and sustained prestige\n\nStreep's portrayal of British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in the 2011 biopic *The Iron Lady* garnered widespread acclaim for her physical and vocal transformation, securing her third Academy Award for Best Actress at the 84th ceremony on February 26, 2012, from a field including Michelle Williams and Viola Davis. The film, directed by Phyllida Lloyd with a budget of $13 million, earned $114.4 million worldwide despite mixed reviews critiquing its biographical structure as superficial, with Streep's performance frequently cited as the primary strength.\n\nExpanding into lighter fare, Streep starred opposite Tommy Lee Jones in the 2012 romantic comedy *Hope Springs*, playing a wife seeking to revive her marriage after 31 years, which grossed $23.5 million domestically and received positive notices for the leads' chemistry amid a formulaic script. In 2013, she adapted her Tony-nominated stage role as the matriarch Violet Weston in *August: Osage County*, a dysfunctional family drama directed by John Wells that earned $37.6 million domestically but divided critics, with Streep's commanding presence earning her a sixth Best Actress Oscar nomination in 2014.\n\nVenturing into musical territory, Streep embodied the Witch in the 2014 Disney adaptation *Into the Woods*, a role requiring vocal demands she prepared for over months, contributing to the film's $213.1 million global box office while earning her a Best Supporting Actress nomination at the 87th Academy Awards. Her performance, blending menace and vulnerability in Stephen Sondheim's fairy-tale mashup, was praised for energy but critiqued in some quarters for prioritizing spectacle over subtlety.\n\nLater projects included the 2017 historical drama *The Post*, where she depicted publisher Katharine Graham navigating the Pentagon Papers scandal alongside Tom Hanks, netting a seventh Best Actress nomination and $180 million worldwide on a $35 million budget.) In 2018, Streep appeared as the eccentric balloon lady Topsy in *Mary Poppins Returns*, delivering a memorable musical sequence that aligned with the film's $349.5 million gross. Concluding the decade, her turn as Aunt March in Greta Gerwig's 2019 adaptation of *Little Women* marked her 21st Oscar nomination overall, for Best Supporting Actress, amid the film's $218.5 million earnings and critical success for its ensemble fidelity to Louisa May Alcott's novel.)\n\nThroughout the decade, Streep's output demonstrated versatility across genres—from biopics and comedies to musicals and period pieces—sustaining her prestige with multiple Academy nods, though select reviewers observed a pattern of accent-driven impersonations occasionally overshadowing narrative depth, evoking terms like \"artful drag\" in critiques of her transformative style. This period bridged her earlier dramatic peaks with broader commercial engagements, yielding inconsistent box office but enduring awards recognition.\n\n### 2020s: Streaming expansions and legacy projects\n\nIn the 2020s, Meryl Streep expanded her presence on streaming platforms, reflecting broader industry shifts toward digital distribution amid the COVID-19 pandemic's disruption of theatrical releases. Her projects during this period included HBO Max's *Let Them All Talk* (2020), a comedy-drama directed by Steven Soderbergh in which she portrayed author Alice Childers on a cruise confronting past relationships. That same year, she starred as Dee Dee Allen in Netflix's musical *The Prom*, earning a Satellite Award nomination for Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy.\n\nStreep's 2021 output featured Netflix's satirical *Don't Look Up*, where she played President Janie Orlean in a cast alongside Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Lawrence, critiquing media and political responses to crisis. She also appeared in Wes Anderson's anthology film *The French Dispatch*, released theatrically and on streaming, contributing to its ensemble of vignettes set in a fictional newspaper. In 2023, Streep joined Apple TV+'s *Extrapolations* anthology series addressing climate change, voicing segments in the multi-episode format.\n\nA notable television venture came with Hulu's *Only Murders in the Building*, where Streep portrayed Loretta Durst in season 3 (2023), earning a 2024 Emmy nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series. Her involvement extended into subsequent seasons, with appearances noted through 2025. This role marked a return to serialized television following personal life changes, including her 2023 separation from Don Gummer after 45 years of marriage.\n\nLooking toward legacy extensions, Streep reprised Miranda Priestly in *The Devil Wears Prada 2*, with filming commencing in 2024 and continuing into 2025 for a planned 2026 theatrical release, alongside returning cast members Anne Hathaway and Emily Blunt. Additionally, in September 2024, she attached to star in a CBS Studios series adaptation of Jonathan Franzen's *The Corrections*, with Franzen adapting the novel about a Midwestern family's dysfunction. These projects underscore Streep's adaptation to streaming's dominance while leveraging established franchises for continued prominence.\n\n## Stage and other performances\n\n### Key theatrical works\n\nStreep's return to the stage in the 2000s highlighted her enduring affinity for live theater's unfiltered demands, where performances unfold without the safety net of multiple takes or post-production edits, contrasting sharply with the controlled precision of screen acting. In Anton Chekhov's *The Seagull* (2001), directed by Mike Nichols at the Public Theater's Delacorte Theater in Central Park, she portrayed the vain actress Arkadina, delivering a portrayal noted for its layered emotional volatility and command of Chekhov's tragicomic rhythms during the limited summer run from July to August. The production, featuring co-stars like Natalie Portman and Philip Seymour Hoffman, underscored theater's immediacy, with Streep's live interpretations adapting nightly to audience energy in an outdoor venue exposed to variable weather.\n\nHer most physically taxing stage role came in Bertolt Brecht's *Mother Courage and Her Children* (2006), again at the Delacorte under George C. Wolfe's direction with Tony Kushner's adaptation, where Streep embodied the resilient canteen wagon proprietor across a 12-year wartime span, performing from August 21 to early September. Streep's interpretation demanded sustained vocal stamina, including singing folk-inspired songs while maneuvering a massive, 12-foot-high wagon onstage—replicating the endurance of live endurance theater versus film's editable sequences—and earned critical acclaim for its raw, supernova-like intensity amid Brechtian alienation techniques. The role garnered a 2007 Drama Desk Award nomination for Outstanding Actress in a Play, affirming her technical prowess in projecting to large outdoor audiences without amplification aids common in modern venues.\n\nEarlier, in the late 1970s amid her film ascent, Streep appeared in *Marilyn: An American Fable* (1979), a short-lived Broadway musical depicting Marilyn Monroe's life, where her multifaceted vocals and mimicry showcased pre-stardom range, though the production closed quickly due to mixed reception on its biographical framing. These works illustrate theater's causal demands on performers—real-time adaptation, physical replication of props like wagons, and unamplified projection—distinct from screen work's retakes, which Streep has prioritized since, with no major stage engagements post-2010 amid escalating film and television commitments.\n\n### Voice acting and musical contributions\n\nStreep provided the voice for Mrs. Fox in the animated film *Fantastic Mr. Fox* (2009), delivering a nuanced portrayal that emphasized maternal concern through tonal warmth and subtle inflections. She also voiced the Queen in *The Ant Bully* (2006), contributing authoritative narration to the insect-themed animation. Additional voice work includes Jessica Lovejoy in a 1995 episode of *The Simpsons*, where her delivery captured sly adolescent mischief via pitch modulation.\n\nIn documentary narration, Streep has employed her versatile timbre for historical and environmental projects, voicing Eleanor Roosevelt in Ken Burns's *The Roosevelts: An Intimate History* (2014 PBS series), which drew on archival intonations for authenticity. She narrated *Escape from Extinction* (2020), highlighting conservation efforts with measured gravitas, and reprised similar roles in sequels announced for 2025. Her narration extends to nature films like *The Living Sea* (2000 IMAX), where spoken delivery conveyed oceanic scale through rhythmic pacing.\n\nStreep's musical contributions feature singing in film adaptations, including multiple ABBA covers on the *Mamma Mia!* (2008) soundtrack, such as \"The Winner Takes It All,\" recorded in studio sessions that prioritized emotional delivery over technical polish. In *Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again* (2018), she reprised vocal tracks for Donna Sheridan's songs, integrating pre-recorded elements into ensemble sequences. For *Mary Poppins Returns* (2018), she performed \"Turning Turtle\" as Cousin Topsy, employing a light, whimsical soprano extension suited to the whimsical score. In *Into the Woods* (2014), her Witch role demanded a broad range from chest-supported belts to stratospheric notes, as evidenced by studio recordings spanning approximately B2 to D6. Audio examinations of these tracks reveal post-production pitch correction, particularly in sustained high passages, to align with Broadway standards despite live-set recording attempts.\n\n## Awards and commercial analysis\n\n### Major accolades and nominations\n\nMeryl Streep has received 21 Academy Award nominations, the most for any performer in history, with three wins: Best Supporting Actress for *Kramer vs. Kramer* (1979 film, awarded March 1980), Best Actress for *Sophie's Choice* (1982), and Best Actress for *The Iron Lady* (2011). Her nominations span leading and supporting roles across dramas, comedies, and biopics, with 17 in the Best Actress category alone, underscoring her versatility but also instances of multiple nominations without wins, such as five between 2009 and 2018.\n\nShe holds the record for most Golden Globe wins by an actress with eight, from 31 nominations (as of 2023), including victories for *The French Lieutenant's Woman* (1982), *Sophie's Choice* (1983), *Silkwood* (1984), *Out of Africa* (1986), *Heartburn* (1987, Comedy/Musical), *A Cry in the Dark* (1989), *The Devil Wears Prada* (2007, Comedy/Musical), and *Mamma Mia!* (2009, Comedy/Musical). This tally exceeds previous benchmarks for female performers, reflecting consistent recognition from the Hollywood Foreign Press Association across genres.\n\n| Award | Nominations | Wins |\n|-------|--------------|------|\n| Primetime Emmy (acting) | 5 | 2 (Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries/Movie: *Holocaust* 1978, *Angels in America* 2004) |\n| Tony | 1 (Best Featured Actress in a Play: *27 Wagons Full of Cotton* 1977) | 0 |\n| Screen Actors Guild | Multiple | 2 (Outstanding Actress: *Doubt* 2009, *Julia \\u0026 Julia* 2010) |\n\nStreep received the Kennedy Center Honors in 2011 for her contributions to American culture through performing arts. She was awarded the American Film Institute Life Achievement Award in 2004, recognizing her body of work as the 32nd recipient. These lifetime honors, alongside records like the longest span between Oscar wins (31 years from 1980 to 2011), highlight patterns of sustained peer and institutional acclaim amid varying commercial outputs.\n\n### Box office performance and financial outcomes\n\nMeryl Streep's films in leading roles have collectively grossed over $4.4 billion worldwide, reflecting a career marked by both substantial commercial successes and occasional underperformances. This total underscores her draw in prestige dramas early on, transitioning to broader appeal in later decades through genre diversification. However, not all projects translated critical regard into financial viability, with variability influenced by release timing, genre, and marketing rather than acting prowess alone.\n\nKey commercial hits include *Mamma Mia!* (2008), which earned $609 million worldwide on a $52 million budget, driven by its musical format and global appeal. Similarly, *The Devil Wears Prada* (2006) generated $326 million globally from a $35 million budget, benefiting from its sharp comedy and ensemble draw. These post-2000 releases highlight a pattern where Streep-led films averaged over $100 million in worldwide grosses when leaning into accessible genres like musicals and rom-coms, contrasting earlier dramatic vehicles with more inconsistent returns.\n\nUnderperformers reveal market realities decoupled from acclaim. *Still of the Night* (1982), a thriller, grossed just $5.9 million domestically against expectations for a major release. In the 1990s, films like *The House of the Spirits* (1993) opened to a mere $1.8 million and failed to gain traction. Later examples include *Lions for Lambs* (2007), which earned $63 million on a $35 million budget despite star power, hampered by its political drama niche. and *Ricki and the Flash* (2015), modest at $41 million worldwide from an $18 million outlay, limited by indie-rock drama appeal.\n\n| Film | Worldwide Gross | Budget | Genre |\n|------|-----------------|--------|-------|\n| Mamma Mia! (2008) | $609M | $52M | Musical |\n| The Devil Wears Prada (2006) | $326M | $35M | Comedy |\n| Lions for Lambs (2007) | $63M | $35M | Drama |\n| Ricki and the Flash (2015) | $41M | $18M | Drama |\n\nThis table illustrates disparities, with successes often tied to crowd-pleasing elements versus prestige-focused flops. Post-2000 genre shifts—favoring lighter fare—correlate with higher averages, suggesting audience preferences for entertainment over solemnity drive outcomes more than pedigree. Early career variability stemmed from art-house leanings amid blockbuster eras, while later hits capitalized on Streep's versatility in mainstream vehicles.\n\n## Activism and public stances\n\n### Environmental and social advocacy\n\nIn 1989, Streep co-founded Mothers \\u0026 Others for a Livable Planet, a consumer advocacy group affiliated with the Natural Resources Defense Council that focused on reducing pesticide residues in food to protect children's health and promote sustainable agriculture, including campaigns against the use of daminozide on apples and advocacy for organic produce labeling and availability. The organization, where Streep served as spokesperson, operated successfully for 12 years, influencing consumer demand for pesticide-free foods and contributing to policy discussions on chemical safety in agriculture without direct regulatory enforcement but through public awareness and market pressure.\n\nStreep has engaged in broader environmental efforts, including collaborations with the Natural Resources Defense Council to highlight conservation priorities such as protecting the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge from development, and in 2024, she narrated a public service announcement for the Sustainable Entertainment Alliance encouraging the film industry to integrate factual, engaging stories about climate change impacts to foster public understanding without alarmism. Her role as Karen Silkwood in the 1983 film *Silkwood* dramatized real workplace contamination risks at a Kerr-McGee plutonium plant, drawing attention to nuclear safety protocols and corporate responsibility, which amplified ongoing union testimonies and led to a $1.38 million settlement in Silkwood's family's lawsuit against the company for negligence.\n\nOn the social front, Streep has supported Amnesty International since the 1980s, participating in their 1986 \"A Conspiracy of Hope\" tour of benefit concerts across the United States to raise funds and awareness for human rights documentation and prisoner releases, leveraging celebrity platforms to expand the organization's reach to over 500,000 attendees and millions via broadcast.\n\n### Political involvement and statements\n\nIn 2016, Streep publicly endorsed Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, aligning with numerous Hollywood figures in support of the Democratic nominee. During the 74th Golden Globe Awards on January 8, 2017, in her acceptance speech for the Cecil B. DeMille Award, Streep critiqued then-President-elect Donald Trump for mocking New York Times reporter Serge Kovaleski—who has arthrogryposis, a condition limiting joint movement—and alluded to Trump's \"nasty woman\" remark toward Clinton during their October 2016 debate. Trump responded on Twitter the following day, describing Streep as \"over-rated\" and claiming she was a \"Hillary flunky.\"\n\nStreep's political engagements have included associations with controversial industry figures. In September 2009, she was among over 100 signatories, including Woody Allen, Martin Scorsese, and Pedro Almodóvar, to a petition circulated by Bernard-Henri Lévy and Harvey Weinstein urging Swiss authorities to release Roman Polanski, who had been arrested on a U.S. extradition warrant stemming from his 1978 flight before sentencing on a 1977 guilty plea to unlawful sexual intercourse with a 13-year-old girl. The petition argued Polanski's detention violated artistic freedom and cited his contributions to cinema, though Polanski remains a fugitive from U.S. justice.\n\nPrior to the October 2017 New York Times exposé on Harvey Weinstein's serial sexual harassment and assault allegations spanning decades, Streep had praised the producer, with whom she collaborated on films including *The Manchurian Candidate* (2004) and *The Iron Lady* (2011); during her 2012 Golden Globe acceptance for the latter, she referred to him as \"God\" and \"the punisher.\" Following the revelations, Streep condemned Weinstein's actions as \"inexcusable\" in an October 9, 2017, statement through her representative, emphasizing that she had no knowledge of his misconduct and hailing accusers as \"heroes.\" She later voiced support for the #MeToo movement, recounting her own experiences with harassment in a January 2018 interview, while defending her pre-scandal ignorance amid criticism of Hollywood's enabling culture. These positions reflect Streep's navigation of industry networks often characterized by uniform progressive stances, where empirical scrutiny of associates' behaviors has historically been limited.\n\n### Criticisms of positions and industry associations\n\nRose McGowan publicly criticized Meryl Streep in December 2017 for perceived hypocrisy in supporting a Golden Globes protest against sexual harassment, asserting that Streep had \"happily worked\" with Harvey Weinstein despite his alleged predatory behavior being an \"open secret\" in Hollywood. McGowan later reiterated in October 2018 that it was \"literally impossible\" for Streep not to have known about Weinstein's history of sexual assault, given their professional collaborations on films like *The River Wild* (1994) and Streep's receipt of donations from Weinstein's company for her advocacy work. Streep responded via a statement denying prior knowledge of Weinstein's crimes, claiming she learned of them only from media reports and expressing willingness to discuss with McGowan, though the exchange highlighted accusations of willful ignorance among Hollywood elites during the #MeToo revelations.\n\nStreep has faced similar scrutiny for her associations with Roman Polanski, the director convicted in 1978 of unlawful sexual intercourse with a 13-year-old and who fled the U.S. to avoid sentencing. Critics, including Donald Trump Jr. in 2017, accused her of \"sickening hypocrisy\" for reportedly giving Polanski a standing ovation at industry events and aligning with Hollywood's broader defense of him amid #MeToo, portraying such support as emblematic of elite tolerance for misconduct when it involves influential figures. This sentiment echoed in analyses of Hollywood's selective accountability, where stars like Streep benefited from collaborations with Polanski-adjacent projects while later condemning similar abuses, fueling claims of class-based double standards in the industry's moral posturing.\n\nIn January 2017, following Streep's Golden Globes acceptance speech decrying Donald Trump's mockery of a disabled reporter, Trump labeled her \"one of the most over-rated actresses in Hollywood,\" a view echoed by some industry skeptics who argue her acclaim stems from coastal liberal biases rather than consistent excellence. Karl Lagerfeld intensified personal critiques in February 2017 by claiming Streep rejected a custom Chanel gown for the Oscars after seeking payment from another designer, prompting Streep to denounce the remarks as \"slander\" and highlighting tensions within fashion-film elite circles. Acting analyses have further described her technique as occasionally \"fussy\" or mannered, with Los Angeles Times critic Kenneth Turan noting in 2012 a tendency toward \"artful drag burlesques\" in roles emphasizing vocal mimicry over depth, positioning her as reliant on Oscar-bait vehicles that prioritize prestige over innovation.\n\nConservative commentators have portrayed Streep's political interventions, such as her anti-Trump rhetoric, as exemplifying Hollywood's out-of-touch elitism and selective outrage, fixating on U.S. domestic controversies while remaining silent on authoritarian abuses like China's suppression of Hong Kong protests in 2019–2020 or Uyghur internment camps, which drew little comment from her despite vocal stances on American issues. This pattern, per outlets like The Week, underscores a coastal bias where industry figures amplify partisan narratives but overlook global human rights violations inconvenient to their worldview or professional interests in markets like China.\n\n## Personal life\n\n### Relationships and family dynamics\n\nMeryl Streep met sculptor Don Gummer through her brother Harry in the summer of 1978, shortly after the death of her partner John Cazale, and the two married on September 30, 1978, at her parents' home in New Jersey. Their union lasted 45 years publicly, producing four children and representing an outlier of longevity amid high divorce rates in Hollywood, where only about 10-15% of celebrity marriages endure beyond two decades according to industry analyses. In October 2023, a representative confirmed the couple had separated over six years prior, around 2017, and chosen to live apart while maintaining mutual care, with no divorce proceedings reported as of 2025.\n\nStreep and Gummer raised son Henry Wolfe Gummer (born August 13, 1979), a musician who performs under the name Henry Wolfe, and daughters Mary Willa \"Mamie\" Gummer (born August 8, 1983), Grace Jane Gummer (born May 9, 1986), and Louisa Jacobson Gummer (born June 12, 1991). Mamie, Grace, and Louisa have pursued acting careers, appearing in films and television series such as *The Good Wife*, *Mr. Robot*, and *The Gilded Age*, respectively, though none have achieved their mother's level of acclaim. Henry has focused on music, releasing albums and avoiding the spotlight.\n\nThe family emphasized privacy, shielding children from media scrutiny during Streep's rise to stardom in the 1980s and 1990s, which enabled a semblance of normalcy despite her absences for filming; Streep has credited Gummer's support role in managing home life as key to this balance. This dynamic contrasted with typical industry instability, fostering independent adult paths for the children, though the late separation at Streep's age of 68 highlighted enduring personal strains beneath the public facade of marital success.\n\n### Residences, health, and later years\n\nStreep maintains primary residences in Connecticut and New York City, with her long-term home in Salisbury, Connecticut, purchased in 1985 for approximately $1.8 million alongside her then-husband Don Gummer.  The Connecticut property, situated in a rural area, has served as a private retreat, reflecting her preference for quieter settings away from urban intensity. In New York City, she owned a Tribeca penthouse overlooking the Hudson River, sold in 2020 for $15.8 million, and previously resided in a Greenwich Village townhouse acquired in 1995 for $2.1 million and sold in 2005. \n\nIn October 2023, Streep's representatives confirmed that she and Gummer, married since September 30, 1978, had been separated for over six years, marking the first period of single status in her adult life spanning 45 years of marriage.  The couple, who share four children, reportedly remain on amicable terms without pursuing divorce, with Gummer living primarily in New York and Connecticut while Streep continues independent pursuits. \n\nAs of 2025, Streep, born June 22, 1949, is 76 years old and has disclosed no major public health issues, attributing her sustained vitality to consistent physical activity rather than rigorous gym routines. She regularly swims approximately 55 laps—equivalent to about one mile—in her pool, a practice she credits for maintaining fitness without strain, performed at least three times weekly.  This low-impact exercise aligns with her avoidance of extreme fitness regimens, focusing instead on natural movement to support longevity.\n\nIn later years, Streep has reflected publicly on aging as a process emphasizing personal achievements over physical appearance, advocating a shift in societal focus from youth-centric ideals to inner resilience. She has expressed no intention of retirement, continuing to engage in professional endeavors while embracing singlehood as a phase of self-directed independence following decades of family-centered life. These perspectives, shared in interviews around 2024, underscore her adaptation to advanced age without diminishing activity levels.\n\n## Legacy and critical assessment\n\n### Artistic influence and techniques\n\nStreep's acting methodology emphasizes empirical immersion and technical precision, rooted in her formal training at the Yale School of Drama from 1972 to 1975, where she honed skills in movement, singing, and verse-speaking to achieve physical and vocal control essential for character embodiment. This foundation enabled her to dissect roles through observable behaviors rather than abstract emotional recall, prioritizing causal replication of real individuals' idiosyncrasies over interpretive invention.\n\nA hallmark of her technique involves phonetic mastery for dialects, demonstrated in *Sophie's Choice* (1982), where she rendered English with a Polish accent alongside German dialogue accented similarly, achieved via self-directed study of linguistic patterns and native speaker consultations to ensure auditory fidelity. She extends this to physical mimicry, as in *The Iron Lady* (2011), employing dentures to protrude her lip matching Margaret Thatcher's overbite, prosthetics for facial structure, and gait analysis to replicate the stateswoman's posture and stride, tested through on-location immersion in full costume.\n\nFor historical figures like Julia Child in *Julie \\u0026 Julia* (2009), Streep integrated archival review of television appearances with practical replication of culinary motions and vocal timbre, adjusting her height perception through elevated heels and practicing Child's warbling intonation to convey authentic kinetic energy. This research-driven approach, favoring verifiable source material over intuition, underscores her causal focus on how observable traits—vocal cadence, bodily mechanics—generate character verisimilitude.\n\nStreep has disseminated these techniques via instructional formats, including a 2016 master class at the Berlinale Talents program, where she instructed aspiring actors on dissecting performances through sensory breakdown and iterative refinement, influencing practitioners to prioritize technical causality in role preparation.\n\n### Debates on overhype and cultural impact\n\nSome critics and observers have argued that Streep's extensive acclaim, including 21 Academy Award nominations and three wins as of 2023, reflects industry hype rather than consistent excellence, particularly given her participation in films of varying quality. For instance, a 2017 analysis contended that performances in *Kramer vs. Kramer* (1979), *Sophie's Choice* (1982), and *The Iron Lady* (2011) relied on technical feats like accents and mannerisms but lacked deeper emotional resonance, elevating mediocre projects through her prestige. Similarly, online discussions highlight her as emblematic of \"Oscar bait\" campaigns, where studios nominate her routinely for for-your-consideration pushes, regardless of standout merit in ensemble casts or lighter fare like *Mamma Mia!* (2008).\n\nProminent detractors have amplified this view; former President Donald Trump described Streep as \"one of the most overrated actresses in Hollywood\" in a 2017 tweet responding to her Golden Globes speech critiquing his behavior toward a disabled reporter. New Yorker critic Pauline Kael offered earlier, more substantive critique, dismissing Streep's approach as overly intellectualized and \"robotic,\" favoring calculated conceptions over instinctive sensuality or raw energy found in actors she admired. Kael's biographer noted this preference for \"ripe sensuality, inflected with a certain craziness,\" which Streep's methodical transformations rarely embodied, influencing later debates on whether her versatility masks limited innate charisma. Streep has occasionally echoed such sentiments self-referentially, calling herself the \"most overrated, over-decorated\" actress in speeches at a 2017 gala and a 2025 event addressing critics.\n\nStreep's cultural impact centers on elevating standards for female-led prestige performances, emphasizing immersive preparation, dialect work, and physical transformations that became hallmarks of \"serious\" acting by the 1980s. Her roles in films like *The Devil Wears Prada* (2006) and *Julia \\u0026 Julia* (2009) popularized the archetype of the multifaceted older woman, influencing subsequent generations to prioritize empathy-driven character studies over typecasting. This \"Streep effect\" extended economically, with studies showing her casting correlated with higher returns on mid-budget dramas, reinforcing Hollywood's reliance on veteran prestige draws.\n\nYet debates persist on whether this influence prioritizes surface-level technique—mimicry of accents and gestures—over profound emotional truth, potentially fostering a formulaic \"transformation acting\" that dominates awards cycles but yields diminishing artistic returns. Critics argue her dominance has overshadowed peers like Glenn Close or Jessica Lange, who delivered comparably intense work with fewer nods, attributing Streep's status to a self-perpetuating narrative of unparalleled versatility amid Hollywood's affinity for reliable, ideologically aligned figures. Her later-career choices, blending prestige biopics with commercial musicals, underscore a cultural legacy of adaptability but also invite scrutiny for sustaining hype through volume over selective brilliance.",
