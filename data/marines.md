# Marines

Marines are members of a specialized branch of a nation's military forces, trained and equipped for operations at sea, particularly amphibious warfare, expeditionary missions, and service as naval infantry in support of naval campaigns. These forces, also known as marine corps or naval infantry, exist in numerous countries and typically operate under or in close coordination with the navy, enabling rapid deployment from sea to land for combat, security, and humanitarian purposes. Prominent examples include the United States Marine Corps (USMC), the Royal Marines of the United Kingdom, the Russian Naval Infantry, the Republic of Korea Marine Corps, and the Dutch Korps Mariniers, among others worldwide.

Marine forces emphasize versatility across domains, integrating ground, air, and logistics elements to form scalable task forces capable of responding to crises globally. Their roles extend beyond warfighting to include shipboard security, embassy protection, special operations, and disaster relief. Historically originating in ancient naval traditions, modern marines have evolved through centuries of conflict, adapting to technological and strategic changes while maintaining a focus on power projection from the sea. Today, these forces number in the hundreds of thousands worldwide, with sizes varying by nation—the USMC, for instance, comprises approximately 170,000 active-duty personnel and 32,000 reservists as of 2025—ensuring agile support for national and international security objectives.

## Terminology

### Etymology

The English term "marines" derives from the French word *marin* (meaning "of the sea" or "sailors"), which itself traces back to the Latin *marinus*, denoting something pertaining to the sea (*mare*). This usage reflected the need for disciplined soldiers capable of operating in maritime environments. The professionalized concept of marines as specialized infantry serving aboard ships emerged in the 17th century. The Dutch adaptation, *mariniers*, was formalized through the establishment of the Regiment de Marine on 10 December 1665 by Grand Pensionary Johan de Witt and Admiral Michiel de Ruyter, as documented in contemporary Dutch naval orders.

The term was independently adopted in England amid similar naval rivalries, with the creation of the Duke of York and Albany's Maritime Regiment of Foot on 28 October 1664, marking the first formal English marine unit and drawing from French precedents. Early English references appear in 17th-century documents, such as a 1672 entry in Colonel Edye's historical account of the Royal Marines and diarist Narcissus Luttrell's 1690 notation of commissions to raise marine regiments, alongside naval regulations that codified their shipboard duties.

This linguistic evolution distinguished "marines" from earlier, less formalized concepts of naval infantry or "sea soldiers" seen in ancient Greek *epibatai* or Roman *milites classiarii*, highlighting the 17th-century shift toward dedicated, trainable forces essential to the Age of Sail's expeditionary warfare. The term's adoption across European navies underscored the growing importance of amphibious capabilities, professionalizing what had previously been improvised troop deployments.

### Translations and Equivalent Terms

In various languages, the concept of marines—specialized naval infantry trained for amphibious and expeditionary operations—is rendered through terms that emphasize their dual maritime and land-based roles, often adapting from historical naval traditions. In Spanish, the term "infantería de marina," meaning "naval infantry," has been used since the 16th century to describe these forces, originating with the creation of dedicated units by Charles I in 1537 to serve aboard Spanish Navy vessels. This designation persists in Spain and extends to Latin American navies, such as those of Mexico and Argentina, where it denotes amphibious troops integrated into naval structures for coastal defense and power projection.

The French equivalent, "Troupes de marine" or "maritime troops," traces its origins to the 17th century, when Cardinal Richelieu established the Compagnies ordinaires de la mer in 1622 as naval landing forces under the Ministry of the Navy. Evolving through colonial expansions, the term was formalized for infantry regiments from 1822 to 1900 and readopted in 1961 for France's modern overseas projection forces, highlighting their role in both amphibious assaults and sustained ground operations abroad.

In Russian, "Морская пехота" (morskaya pekhota), literally "naval infantry" or "sea infantry," underscores the emphasis on land combat launched from maritime platforms, a concept rooted in Peter the Great's formation of dedicated regiments in 1705 for the Imperial Russian Navy. This term, retained in the post-Soviet era, reflects a focus on coastal raiding and amphibious maneuvers in the Baltic and Black Sea theaters, distinguishing it from purely naval personnel by its infantry-centric doctrine.

Asian languages exhibit similar literal translations that prioritize the navy's ground-fighting arm. In Chinese, "海军陆战队" (hǎijūn lùzhàn duì), translating to "navy land battle team" or "marine corps," describes the People's Liberation Army Navy's amphibious units, established in 1953 for operations against offshore islands during the early Cold War. In Arabic, variations like "قوات البحرية المشاة" (quwat al-bahriyya al-mushat), meaning "naval infantry forces," are used across Middle Eastern militaries, such as in Saudi Arabia's Royal Marines, to denote forces for maritime security and expeditionary landings.

Cultural nuances in terminology often reveal differing emphases: for instance, the Japanese "海兵隊" (kaiheitai), meaning "sea soldier corps," typically refers to foreign marine forces like the U.S. Marines but aligns with Japan's Amphibious Rapid Deployment Brigade, established in 2018, which prioritizes island defense over broad naval integration, reflecting post-World War II constitutional constraints on offensive operations. These terms collectively adapt the core idea of marines to local military traditions, with some stressing amphibious assault (e.g., Russian and Chinese) and others broader expeditionary integration (e.g., French and Spanish).

## Roles and Functions

### Amphibious and Expeditionary Operations

Amphibious warfare involves a coordinated military operation launched from the sea by naval and landing forces to project power ashore, integrating sea, air, and ground elements against a hostile or potentially hostile shore. This form of warfare emphasizes the use of landing craft, amphibious vehicles, and helicopters for ship-to-shore movement, including vertical envelopment tactics that allow forces to bypass beach defenses and land inland via air assault. The primary objective is to establish a lodgment on enemy territory while minimizing vulnerability during the transit and landing phases, relying on surprise, speed, and synchronized operations across domains.

Key tactics in amphibious operations center on securing a beachhead—a designated area on the shore seized to facilitate the buildup of combat power and enable further maneuver. This involves organized waves of landing craft and vehicles to deliver assault elements rapidly, often under covering fire to suppress enemy positions. Naval assets provide essential fire support through surface gunfire, close air strikes, and later organic artillery once ashore, ensuring continuous suppression of defenses during the assault. The rapid seizure of key objectives follows, achieved by exploiting gaps in enemy lines via maneuver warfare, transitioning from ship-to-shore movement to sustained ground operations.

Expeditionary operations extend amphibious capabilities by deploying marine forces as self-sustaining units capable of power projection from the sea, often without reliance on fixed land bases. These operations involve seabasing, where forces embark on ships to conduct missions such as initial entry into conflict zones or humanitarian assistance, maintaining flexibility in austere environments. Marine forces operate as expeditionary forces-in-readiness, trained for quick response to crises through integrated logistics and command structures that support prolonged independence from shore infrastructure. For example, the United States Marine Corps (USMC) employs Marine Expeditionary Units (MEUs) for this purpose, while equivalent units exist in other nations, such as the British Royal Marines' Littoral Manoeuvre Groups.

Generalized historical examples of amphibious warfare illustrate these tactics in large-scale assaults on defended coastlines, such as the coordinated beach landings and vertical assaults during major 20th-century conflicts, where forces established beachheads amid intense resistance to enable broader campaigns.

In modern contexts, amphibious and expeditionary operations have adapted to contested environments through the integration of unmanned aerial systems (drones) for reconnaissance and targeting, alongside precision-guided munitions that enhance accuracy and reduce collateral damage during landings. These advancements allow for distributed operations, where marine forces leverage long-range fires and real-time intelligence to navigate anti-access/area-denial threats, maintaining the core emphasis on rapid power projection.

### Special Operations and Rapid Response

Marine special operations units conduct special reconnaissance to gather intelligence in hostile or denied areas, direct action raids to seize or destroy high-value targets, and counter-terrorism operations to neutralize threats and networks, often launching from maritime platforms to leverage expeditionary advantages in littoral environments. These missions emphasize small-team precision strikes and information operations, distinct from larger-scale amphibious assaults by focusing on covert, high-risk insertions via sea, air, or land. Examples include the USMC's Marine Forces Special Operations Command (MARSOC) and the United Kingdom's Special Boat Service within the Royal Marines, which perform analogous roles in joint and multinational contexts.

Rapid response capabilities enable marine units to intervene in crises, reinforce embassies under threat, and execute non-combatant extractions from unstable regions, drawing on forward-deployed assets for swift maritime-based deployment. For instance, in March 2025, USMC personnel from the Special Purpose Marine Air-Ground Task Force evacuated approximately 20 U.S. Embassy staff from Juba, South Sudan, amid escalating violence, completing the operation without incident. These forces maintain readiness for immediate action, typically achieving initial deployment within 24 to 72 hours from alert, supported by amphibious ready groups positioned globally. USMC MEUs, for example, are designed for alert-to-deployment in under 6 hours for forward units.

Marine special operations integrate closely with other special forces in expeditionary settings, conducting joint exercises and missions with units like army rangers and navy SEALs to enhance interoperability in maritime and littoral contexts. A notable example is the 2022 close air support training in the Indo-Pacific, where USMC MARSOC Raiders, U.S. Army Special Forces, and Navy SEALs practiced coordinated raids and fire support from sea-based positions. This collaboration ensures seamless task organization for complex operations, such as combined reconnaissance and direct action in denied areas.

Training for these units stresses versatility across diverse environments, preparing operators for urban warfare through live-fire simulations in mock cities, arctic operations via cold-weather survival exercises in Alaska, and desert maneuvers emphasizing mobility and sustainment in arid conditions, all initiated from naval vessels to maintain expeditionary flexibility.

Effectiveness is demonstrated by rapid response metrics and historical outcomes; MEUs and special operations teams achieve deployment alerts in under 6 hours for forward units, with full operational capability in 24-72 hours, contributing to high success rates in crises like the 2006 Lebanon evacuation, where U.S. Marines helped extract nearly 15,000 U.S. citizens in 21 days with zero casualties. Such operations highlight the value of scalable logistics from sea bases.

### Support and Logistical Roles

Marine forces fulfill essential support and logistical roles that underpin the sustainment and security of naval and expeditionary operations, ensuring the seamless execution of missions in diverse environments. These functions encompass a range of non-combat activities, from securing maritime assets to managing supply chains, which enable forces to maintain operational tempo without direct engagement in hostilities.

In shipboard security, marines provide critical protection for naval vessels, conducting patrols to deter threats and executing boarding actions to inspect suspicious craft. These duties include anti-piracy operations, where marines deploy to safeguard shipping lanes against illicit activities, often in coordination with multinational task forces. For instance, visit, board, search, and seizure (VBSS) teams train to neutralize potential maritime threats, enhancing vessel safety during transit.

Logistical support forms the backbone of marine operations, involving the management of supply chains for expeditionary forces to ensure timely delivery of materiel, fuel, and personnel. This includes establishing forward basing to sustain prolonged deployments and coordinating medical evacuation to preserve force health in remote areas. Marines in logistics units handle inventory control, transportation, and distribution, adapting to austere conditions to support distributed operations across joint environments.

Ceremonial and diplomatic roles highlight marines' contributions to international relations, serving as honor guards at official events and as attachés to embassies to facilitate secure diplomatic engagements. These marines participate in multinational exercises, fostering alliances through joint training and protocol adherence. Additionally, marine security detachments protect diplomatic missions abroad, upholding traditions of vigilance that date back centuries; for example, the USMC's Marine Security Guard program secures over 280 U.S. posts, while similar units exist in other nations like Australia's Embassy Guard Unit.

Engineering tasks by marines focus on enabling operational access, such as preparing beaches for landings, clearing obstacles, and constructing temporary infrastructure like bridges or shelters in contested zones. These efforts support mobility and survivability, integrating briefly with amphibious assaults to facilitate force entry. Marine engineers employ specialized equipment for rapid site preparation, ensuring logistical nodes remain functional amid environmental challenges.

In modern contexts, marine roles have evolved to incorporate support for cyber and information operations, providing defensive measures and network sustainment to protect expeditionary communications. This includes training specialists in cyberspace tasks to counter digital threats, ensuring information flows remain secure during operations. Such adaptations reflect broader shifts toward hybrid warfare, where logistical resilience extends to the digital domain.

## History

### Ancient Origins

The earliest precursors to marine forces emerged in ancient civilizations, where naval warfare relied on soldiers embarked on ships to conduct boarding actions and support amphibious operations, rather than dedicated professional units. In Classical Greece during the 5th century BCE, epibatai—hoplite marines—served aboard triremes as ship-board infantry, typically numbering 10 per vessel and equipped with spears, shields, and helmets for hand-to-hand combat after ramming or grappling enemy ships. These citizen-soldiers, aged 20 to 30 and drawn from the middle social strata, enhanced the tactical weight of Greek fleets in battles like Salamis in 480 BCE, where they contributed to the victory over the Persians by engaging in close-quarters fighting in the narrow straits.

Similarly, in the Roman Republic from the 3rd century BCE, classiarii and milites classis functioned as marines within the nascent navy, often drawn from legionary detachments for shipboard duties including boarding and securing vessels during naval engagements. These troops, numbering around 40 per larger warship, supported operations against Carthage in the Punic Wars and extended to riverine campaigns along the Tiber and other inland waterways, blending infantry tactics with maritime mobility. Their roles evolved under the Empire, but in the Republican era, they exemplified ad hoc integrations of soldiers into naval contexts without specialized fleet organizations.

During the Achaemenid Empire (6th–4th centuries BCE), Persian forces incorporated ship troops from subject Phoenician and Ionian sailors, who provided archery support and boarding capabilities on triremes and penteconters, with up to 30 Persian marines per vessel to enforce discipline and lead assaults. These marines, often elite infantry, were crucial for operations like the invasions of Greece, where they manned decks for missile volleys and close combat, compensating for the navy's reliance on allied crews.

In Northern Europe, Norse sea raiders from the 8th to 11th centuries CE, including berserkers—elite warriors in animal-pelt attire who fought in frenzied states—conducted amphibious raids using longships for rapid beach landings and inland strikes, as seen in assaults on monasteries and coastal settlements across Britain and Ireland. Operating in small, kin-based groups without formal hierarchies, these proto-marines combined sailing prowess with shock infantry tactics, foreshadowing later expeditionary forces. Across these ancient examples, marine-like roles lacked permanent structures, depending instead on temporary soldier-sailor combinations tailored to specific campaigns.

### Early Modern Era (16th-18th Centuries)

The emergence of dedicated marine units in the Early Modern Era marked a pivotal development in naval warfare, as European powers formalized infantry forces specialized for shipboard combat, boarding actions, and amphibious assaults to support expanding maritime empires. These units evolved from ad hoc soldier detachments on vessels, drawing brief inspiration from ancient practices of shipboard fighting, but became permanent institutions amid the Age of Sail and colonial rivalries. By the 16th century, naval powers recognized the need for disciplined troops capable of operating both at sea and on land, particularly for protecting trade routes, conducting raids, and securing overseas possessions.

The Spanish Marine Infantry, established on February 27, 1537, by Charles I (also Holy Roman Emperor Charles V), stands as the world's oldest permanent marine corps still in existence. Formed as companies of harquebusiers assigned to the galleons of the Spanish Navy, these marines integrated into the renowned tercio formations—mixed pike-and-shot infantry units of up to 3,000 men—for deployments during transoceanic voyages and conquests in the Americas. The Tercio de Galeras, a specialized marine tercio, was dedicated exclusively to service aboard galleys and galleons, emphasizing close-quarters combat and amphibious support in Spain's global expeditions.

In England, the Marine Regiment of 1664, raised on October 28 under Charles II as the Duke of York and Albany's Maritime Regiment of Foot, served as the direct precursor to the modern Royal Marines. Comprising about 1,200 infantrymen, it was created amid escalating tensions with the Dutch Republic and saw immediate action in the Second Anglo-Dutch War (1665–1667), where marines manned ship decks for boarding operations and supported naval engagements like the Battle of Lowestoft.

The Dutch Marine Corps (Korps Mariniers), founded on December 10, 1665, by Grand Pensionary Johan de Witt during the same Second Anglo-Dutch War, became the second-oldest marine force and focused on protecting Dutch maritime commerce. Initially formed from existing naval infantry companies into a regiment, it emphasized operations for the Dutch East India Company (VOC), securing trade routes to Asia by conducting amphibious raids and defending merchant convoys against pirates and rivals.

France established its Marine Troops, known as the Compagnies Franches de la Marine, on December 16, 1690, under Louis XIV to provide permanent infantry for naval and colonial service. These independent companies, numbering around 40 by the mid-18th century but rooted in earlier 1683 detachments to New France, were deployed for expeditions in the Americas—defending Quebec against English assaults—and in India, where they garrisoned French trading posts amid conflicts with British and local forces.

Key innovations during this period included the adaptation of musketeer tactics for shipboard use, where marines fired volleys from decks and rigging during boarding attempts to suppress enemy crews before close combat with pikes and swords, as seen in Anglo-Dutch naval clashes. Amphibious landings also advanced, with coordinated naval bombardments and sequential troop waves enabling assaults like the failed 1694 expedition to Brest during the Nine Years' War (1688–1697), where 10 battalions including 600 grenadiers attempted to secure a beachhead against French defenses under Vauban, highlighting the risks of disordered landings despite vanguard tactics. Earlier successes, such as the 1689 relief of Londonderry—where 600 troops landed on Inch Island to outflank Jacobite forces—and the 1690 captures of Cork and Kinsale, demonstrated marines' and infantry's roles in breaking booms, establishing redoubts, and linking with naval fire support to lift sieges. These operations in the Nine Years' War refined combined arms approaches, prioritizing frigates for covering fire and grenadiers as shock troops in contested shores.

### 19th Century Developments

During the 19th century, marine forces worldwide adapted to the demands of expanding colonial empires and the transition from sail to steam propulsion, enabling more versatile amphibious and expeditionary roles in imperial conflicts. The United States Marine Corps exemplified this evolution through legislative formalization and combat deployments that supported American interests abroad. In 1834, Congress reorganized the Corps under direct naval jurisdiction, allowing for flexible attachments to Army units by presidential order and marking a key step in its institutional growth as a specialized amphibious force. This structure facilitated its involvement in early 19th-century operations, including the Barbary Wars (1801–1805), where Marines conducted daring raids such as Lieutenant Stephen Decatur's 1804 burning of the captured USS Philadelphia in Tripoli Harbor and Lieutenant Presley O'Bannon's 1805 overland march to capture Derna, the first U.S. flag-raising over a foreign fortress in the Old World.

The Corps further expanded during Latin American interventions tied to U.S. expansionism and anti-piracy efforts. Its strength surged 57% to over 1,800 personnel by 1848 amid the Mexican-American War (1846–1848), with Marine battalions supporting naval blockades and amphibious landings on both coasts. On the Pacific side, detachments under Captain Ward Marston raised the U.S. flag at Monterey in July 1846 and aided in capturing San Diego and Los Angeles; on the Gulf, over 300 Marines joined General Winfield Scott's advance to Mexico City, fighting at Chapultepec in September 1847 where Major Levi Twiggs was killed leading assaults on fortified positions. Earlier anti-piracy patrols in the Caribbean (1815–1825) saw up to 200 Marines from ships like USS Macedonian seize pirate strongholds, underscoring their role in securing trade routes.

British Royal Marines similarly advanced imperial objectives through naval-integrated operations in Asia and Europe. In the Opium Wars (1839–1842 and 1856–1860), they formed critical detachments for amphibious assaults, including the 1859 occupation of Guangzhou during the Second Opium War, where Marines from HMS Tribune destroyed Chinese warships in the Pearl River Delta and besieged forts to enforce treaty concessions. During the Crimean War (1853–1856), Royal Marines manned shipboard artillery on Royal Navy vessels bombarding Russian positions in the Black Sea, contributing to the siege of Sevastopol and demonstrating their evolving role in steam-era fleet actions amid the conflict's naval dimensions.

Russian naval infantry, or морская пехота, participated in prolonged imperial campaigns, including support for the Caucasian Wars (1817–1864), where Black Sea Fleet detachments provided amphibious reinforcement and coastal suppression against Circassian and other North Caucasian resistors, aiding Russia's gradual conquest of the region. Their deployments extended to East Asian interventions, such as early 19th-century probes into Japanese waters to counter isolationist policies, though major clashes awaited the 20th century.

Technological shifts, particularly the adoption of steam-powered ships, profoundly influenced marine operations by allowing larger detachments, independent of wind, and enabling inland riverine advances. In the U.S. Civil War (1861–1865), this manifested in Marine crews serving on ironclad monitors like USS Monitor, which revolutionized naval warfare with turret-mounted guns and steam propulsion for riverine control of the Mississippi and James Rivers, supporting Union blockades and troop movements.

Colonial imperatives drove marine forces to suppress uprisings in Africa and Asia, often via riverine and coastal operations. Portuguese marines, integrated into naval expeditions, helped quell revolts in Angola during the 19th century, such as mid-century campaigns against inland kingdoms resisting Portuguese expansion from coastal enclaves like Luanda, securing trade routes and plantations through amphibious incursions. These actions reflected broader patterns where marine units, leveraging steam mobility, enforced European dominance in resource-rich territories.

### 20th Century and World Wars

During World War I, marine units were instrumental in defending overseas possessions and conducting interventions amid global conflict. The German Seebataillon, a naval infantry battalion, formed a core part of the approximately 4,000-strong garrison at Tsingtao (modern Qingdao), China's key German naval base in the Pacific. From August to November 1914, these marines, alongside colonial troops, fortified the port with trenches and artillery batteries, resisting a combined Anglo-Japanese assault of over 20,000 troops. Despite fierce resistance, including the first use of aircraft in naval warfare, the Seebataillon surrendered on 7 November 1914, marking the loss of Germany's primary Asian foothold.

Concurrently, the United States Marines spearheaded the occupation of Haiti to counter political instability and perceived German influence in the Caribbean. Following the assassination of President Jean Vilbrun Guillaume Sam in July 1915, approximately 330 Marines landed in Port-au-Prince on 28 July, quickly securing the capital and prompting the election of a pro-American president under a U.S.-imposed treaty. Over the next 19 years, Marines trained and led the Haitian Gendarmerie, suppressed peasant revolts such as the 1919-1920 cacos uprising, and oversaw financial reforms, though the intervention drew criticism for authoritarian measures and racial tensions. The occupation ended in August 1934 under President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Good Neighbor Policy, with U.S. forces withdrawing after transferring control to Haitian authorities.

In the interwar period, marine forces evolved to support imperial expansion, particularly through Japan's creation of Special Naval Landing Forces (SNLF). Established in the 1920s and expanded amid rising militarism, these elite naval infantry units were designed for amphibious assaults and rapid seizures of territory, reflecting Japan's aggressive posture in Asia. The SNLF played a preparatory role in the 1931 invasion of Manchuria following the Mukden Incident, where Japanese forces staged a railway explosion to justify occupying the region; while the initial assault was led by the Kwantung Army, SNLF detachments reinforced occupations and secured coastal flanks, setting precedents for later operations like the 1932 Shanghai landings. This development underscored the shift toward mechanized expeditionary warfare in naval doctrine.

World War II amplified the amphibious role of marines in total war, with forces executing large-scale assaults across theaters. In the Pacific, U.S. Marines initiated the island-hopping strategy at Guadalcanal in August 1942, where the 1st Marine Division, numbering about 11,000 troops, landed on 7 August to capture a Japanese airfield, marking the first major Allied offensive against Japan. Over six months of grueling jungle fighting, supported by the "Cactus Air Force," Marines repelled counterattacks, securing the island by February 1943 at a cost of over 1,600 American lives and establishing a base for further advances toward Japan. This campaign exemplified the integration of marine ground forces with naval and air elements in prolonged attrition battles.

The U.S. Marines' ferocity peaked in the February-March 1945 Battle of Iwo Jima, where roughly 70,000 troops from the 3rd, 4th, and 5th Marine Divisions assaulted volcanic beaches under intense fire from 21,000 entrenched Japanese defenders. Commanded by Lieutenant General Holland M. Smith, the Marines employed flamethrowers, bazookas, and demolitions to clear underground networks, raising the flag on Mount Suribachi on 23 February in an iconic moment of resilience. The 36-day fight secured airfields for B-29 emergency landings but came at staggering cost: nearly 7,000 Marines killed and 20,000 wounded, the bloodiest single operation in Marine Corps history.

In Europe, British Royal Marine Commandos tested amphibious tactics during the 19 August 1942 Dieppe Raid, a reconnaissance-in-force involving 6,100 troops, including 1,000 British Commandos. No. 3 and No. 4 Commandos, alongside Royal Marine "A" Commando (later 40 RM Commando), targeted coastal batteries at Berneval and Varengeville; while No. 4 succeeded in destroying guns and withdrawing, others faced heavy losses from German defenses, with the raid overall failing to seize the port but yielding vital lessons on combined operations. Approximately 370 Royal Marines participated in the main assault, suffering high casualties that informed future invasions like Normandy.

Soviet Naval Infantry, or морская пехота, conducted critical operations in the Black Sea from 1941 to 1944, leveraging small craft for assaults amid Axis advances. In September 1941, the 3rd Marine Regiment's 1,920 troops landed near Odessa to silence Romanian artillery, using 19 motor launches and 10 barges in a night operation that delayed the siege and enabled evacuation. Larger efforts included the December 1941 Kerch-Feodosia landing, where 5,000 marines secured a peninsula foothold before a German counteroffensive, and the 1943 Novorossiysk and Kerch-Eltigen assaults, ferrying 75,000 troops to reclaim Crimean beaches by April 1944 through coordinated naval gunfire and air support. These actions disrupted Axis supply lines and reclaimed key ports.

In the Arctic, Soviet Naval Infantry from the Northern Fleet protected convoy routes vital to Lend-Lease aid, defending ports like Murmansk and Archangel where over 4 million tons of supplies arrived between 1941 and 1945. Units such as the 60th Marine Brigade supported the 1944 Petsamo-Kirkenes Offensive, amphibiously flanking German positions to secure northern flanks and ensure safe unloading amid U-boat threats, contributing to the repulsion of Axis forces from the region.

Technological advancements transformed marine operations, emphasizing mechanized landings and integrated support. The Higgins boat (LCVP), produced in over 12,500 units by Higgins Industries, revolutionized assaults by ferrying 36 troops or a jeep directly onto beaches without harbors, enabling U.S. Marines' Pacific island-hopping from Guadalcanal onward. Complementing this, Marine close air support (CAS) evolved through Air Liaison Parties and the Landing Force Air Support Coordination Unit (LAFASCU), as seen at Tarawa (1943) and Okinawa (1945), where F4U Corsairs flew over 10,000 sorties coordinated with naval gunfire, reducing fratricide and amplifying ground effectiveness despite inter-service tensions. These innovations shifted marines from ship-to-shore dependencies to self-sustained expeditionary forces by war's end.

### Post-1945 Evolution

The post-World War II era marked a significant revival of amphibious doctrines for marine forces, drawing briefly on the extensive lessons from Pacific theater landings to adapt to new geopolitical realities. During the Korean War (1950-1953), the United States executed the Inchon landing on September 15, 1950, which exemplified this revival by leveraging naval gunfire, air support, and rapid troop insertion to outflank North Korean positions, turning the tide of the conflict and recapturing Seoul within weeks. This operation, involving over 70,000 troops under X Corps, demonstrated the continued viability of large-scale amphibious assaults in regional wars, reinforcing marine roles in joint operations despite logistical challenges like extreme tides at Inchon.

In the Vietnam War (1965-1973), U.S. Marine Expeditionary Units (MEUs) evolved to emphasize combined arms operations, integrating infantry, artillery, aviation, and naval support for flexible engagements in contested terrain. The initial landing at Da Nang on March 8, 1965, by the 9th Marine Expeditionary Brigade established a defensive enclave in I Corps, which expanded into offensive roles, including Operation Starlite in August 1965—the first major Marine battle—that validated vertical envelopment and amphibious tactics against Viet Cong forces. Over the war, nearly 500,000 Marines served, shifting from enclave defense to mobile operations that combined helicopter assaults with riverine patrols, adapting amphibious expertise to counterinsurgency in Southeast Asia's littoral and inland environments.

During the Cold War, marine doctrines expanded through NATO integrations and parallel developments in Soviet naval special forces, focusing on deterrence in maritime theaters. NATO's amphibious forces, including contributions from the U.S., UK, and Netherlands, conducted routine exercises in the Mediterranean and North Atlantic to counter potential Soviet incursions, enhancing interoperability under the alliance's flexible response strategy that bolstered maritime contributions to overall deterrence. On the Soviet side, naval Spetsnaz units under GRU oversight specialized in reconnaissance, sabotage, and coastal raids, operating from submarines and surface vessels to disrupt NATO rear areas in a potential European conflict. These units, numbering around 19 battalions by the 1980s, emphasized hybrid tactics like underwater demolition and insertion via swimmer delivery vehicles, mirroring Western marine evolutions but tailored to asymmetric naval threats.

Post-9/11 conflicts shifted marine doctrines toward counterinsurgency and expeditionary responses to non-state threats. In Iraq and Afghanistan, U.S. Marines conducted urban counterinsurgency operations, such as the Second Battle of Fallujah in November 2004, where Regimental Combat Team 7 led a joint assault involving over 10,000 troops to clear insurgent strongholds, employing house-to-house clearing, precision fires, and intelligence-driven maneuvers to dismantle al-Qaeda networks. This operation, part of Operation Phantom Fury, resulted in the deaths of over 1,200 insurgents while highlighting adaptations in urban warfare tactics for stability operations. Concurrently, from 2008 onward, multinational marine contingents, including U.S. forces within NATO's Operation Ocean Shield, supported counter-piracy efforts off Somalia, patrolling key shipping lanes and conducting vessel boardings to deter attacks that peaked at 236 incidents in 2009. These missions emphasized rapid maritime interdiction and international coordination, reducing successful hijackings by over 90% by 2012 through forward-deployed amphibious ready groups.

By the 2020s, marine doctrines have increasingly emphasized littoral warfare and hybrid threats, integrating distributed operations to counter peer competitors in contested maritime domains. The U.S. Marine Corps' Force Design 2030 initiative prioritizes Marine Littoral Regiments for expeditionary advanced basing, focusing on anti-access/area denial through mobile missile batteries and sensor networks in island chains like the Western Pacific. This evolution addresses hybrid challenges—blending conventional, irregular, and cyber elements—by divesting legacy platforms for agile, unmanned systems that enhance survivability against precision strikes, as seen in updated concepts for irregular warfare persistence.

## Modern Marine Forces

### In the Americas

The United States Marine Corps (USMC), established on November 10, 1775, by resolution of the Continental Congress, stands as the preeminent marine force in the Americas, comprising approximately 169,000 active-duty personnel as of 2025. Under the ongoing Force Design 2030 initiative, launched in 2020 and updated in October 2025, the USMC is restructuring to prioritize distributed maritime operations, stand-in forces, and integration with naval assets for contested environments, including reductions in certain legacy capabilities to enhance agility. Key installations such as Camp Pendleton in California serve as primary training and staging bases for expeditionary units, supporting rapid deployment across the Western Hemisphere.

The Brazilian Marine Corps (Corpo de Fuzileiros da Marinha), with approximately 16,000 personnel as of 2024, specializes in riverine warfare along the Amazon River basin and coastal defense operations on the Atlantic seaboard, leveraging specialized units for amphibious assaults and environmental security in expansive inland waterways. In 2025, Brazilian marines actively participated in UNITAS LXVI, the annual multinational maritime exercise hosted by the United States, contributing frigates and infantry elements to enhance interoperability among 25 partner nations focused on hemispheric security.

Argentina's Naval Infantry (Infantería de Marina), numbering about 5,000 troops, underwent significant reforms following the 1982 Falklands War, shifting emphasis toward amphibious reconnaissance, special operations, and lighter, more mobile forces to address vulnerabilities exposed in large-scale landings. These changes included enhanced training in covert insertions and integration with naval aviation for joint littoral maneuvers, reflecting a doctrinal pivot to defensive and expeditionary roles in the South Atlantic.

Smaller marine contingents in the region include Mexico's Naval Infantry, with approximately 20,000 personnel dedicated primarily to counter-narcotics operations along coastal and riverine borders, conducting high-risk interdictions against drug trafficking networks in collaboration with U.S. Southern Command. Colombia's Marine Infantry, around 22,000 strong, focuses on securing the Pacific coast against insurgent activities and illicit trafficking, employing riverine patrols and amphibious units to protect vital maritime economic zones.

Across the Americas, contemporary marine forces exhibit regional trends toward dual-use capabilities in counter-drug enforcement and humanitarian disaster response, adapting amphibious expertise to non-traditional threats like transnational crime and natural calamities. For instance, U.S. marines provided critical aid following the 2010 Haiti earthquake, deploying the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit for search-and-rescue, medical support, and logistics in Port-au-Prince under Operation Unified Response. This emphasis underscores a broader hemispheric shift, where marine units from nations like Mexico and Colombia integrate with multinational efforts, such as 2025 U.S.-led operations deploying over 4,500 marines to disrupt narcotics flows in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific.

### In Europe

European marine forces play a pivotal role in NATO's collective defense strategy, particularly in amphibious operations, rapid response, and securing maritime flanks in contested environments such as the Baltic Sea and the High North.

The Troupes de Marine's structure supports rapid reinforcement to alliance hotspots, including Baltic and Mediterranean scenarios, through multinational amphibious task forces.

The Netherlands Marine Corps, with about 2,500 personnel, operates as a highly mobile force tailored for amphibious and littoral operations, closely integrated with the UK's Royal Marines under the Anglo-Dutch amphibious framework established in 2023. This partnership facilitates shared training and equipment, such as joint landing craft operations, to enhance NATO's forward presence in the Baltic region, where Dutch marines contribute to undersea infrastructure protection and mine countermeasures during exercises like BALTOPS 2025. Their focus on Baltic security includes covert boarding and rapid insertion capabilities, vital for deterring aggression in NATO's northern flank amid heightened regional tensions.

Russia's Naval Infantry, estimated at around 35,000 personnel following expansions since 2022, serves as the Russian Navy's primary amphibious arm, with significant emphasis on the Black Sea Fleet's 810th Naval Infantry Brigade for operations in contested coastal zones. Post the 2022 Ukraine conflict, these forces have prioritized defensive postures and limited offensives along the Black Sea coast, adapting to drone threats and asymmetric warfare while integrating with ground elements for hybrid maneuvers. Unlike NATO counterparts, Russian naval infantry emphasize massed landings and fire support in regional conflicts, though losses have constrained their projection capabilities.

Among smaller units, Greece's 32nd Marine Brigade, based in Volos, specializes in amphibious assaults and island-hopping operations critical for defending the Aegean archipelago against potential incursions. Integrated into NATO's southern flank, the brigade conducts regular exercises like those in 2025 with French and US forces, focusing on expeditionary advanced base operations to secure maritime chokepoints and support alliance deterrence in the Eastern Mediterranean. Similarly, Ukraine's Marine Corps, reestablished in 2022 and expanded into the 30th Marine Corps by 2025, comprises four marine brigades and three coastal defense brigades dedicated to Black Sea littoral protection. These units have fortified coastal defenses with unmanned systems and artillery, enabling resilient operations against Russian naval threats while aligning with NATO standards for interoperability.

### In Asia and Oceania

The marine forces of Asia and Oceania play a pivotal role in regional security, particularly amid intensifying great-power competition in the Indo-Pacific, where island chains and contested littorals demand robust amphibious capabilities for defense and power projection. These units focus on securing maritime domains, deterring aggression, and supporting alliances against threats like territorial disputes and potential invasions.

China's People's Liberation Army Navy Marine Corps (PLANMC) has undergone significant expansion to bolster its presence in the South China Sea, where it supports Beijing's expansive territorial claims. The force currently comprises about 55,000 marines as of 2022 organized into 11 brigades, including eight maneuver brigades, two special operations forces brigades, and one aviation brigade, following the transfer of three brigades from the People's Liberation Army Army in 2023. These units are tasked with amphibious assaults to seize and defend small islands and reefs, enhancing power projection beyond the First Island Chain and integrating with the People's Liberation Army Navy, China Coast Guard, and maritime militia to enforce claims through coercive tactics such as ramming and water cannon use near features like Second Thomas Shoal. The PLANMC operates from strategic bases in Hainan Province, including the Greater Yulin Naval Base with its aircraft carrier dry dock and the East Yulin facility housing ballistic-missile submarines, which together form a $50 billion military stronghold enabling rapid deployment to contested outposts like Mischief Reef.

The Republic of Korea Marine Corps, with approximately 29,000 personnel, remains oriented toward countering North Korean amphibious threats across the Korean Peninsula and surrounding seas. This force conducts intensive training to defend against potential invasions, including beach assaults and island seizures, while participating in joint exercises with U.S. forces to enhance interoperability. Key activities include the Korea Marine Exercise Program (KMEP) 25.2, held alongside Ulchi Freedom Shield 25 in August 2025, which integrated Republic of Korea and U.S. Marines under the Combined Marine Component Command to simulate responses to regional contingencies.

Japan's Amphibious Rapid Deployment Brigade, established in March 2018 as the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force's dedicated marine unit, numbers around 3,000 personnel and is structured with three regiments, headquarters, and support elements to conduct rapid island defense operations. Primarily focused on protecting the Southwest Islands, including the disputed Senkaku Islands, the brigade trains for amphibious landings, coastal defense, and integration with Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force assets to deter incursions amid tensions with China. Its capabilities were demonstrated in exercises like those on Okinawa in March 2025, where Japanese marines practiced beach assaults alongside U.S. forces.

Australia's Amphibious Force, integrated within the Australian Defence Force, leverages the Royal Australian Navy's Canberra-class landing helicopter docks, including HMAS Adelaide, to enable expeditionary operations across the Indo-Pacific. This force supports multi-domain maneuvers, such as the full embarkation of over 30 units from the Navy, Army, and Air Force during Exercise Talisman Sabre 2025 in July, simulating large-scale landings and humanitarian responses. Amid AUKUS enhancements in 2025, which include accelerated submarine acquisitions and technology sharing with the United States and United Kingdom, the force strengthens deterrence in contested littorals, with HMAS Adelaide facilitating joint amphibious assaults tied to regional alliances.

Smaller marine contingents further contribute to archipelago defense in the region. The Philippine Marine Corps, approximately 8,000 strong, focuses on securing features in the South China Sea through coastal defense and joint operations, as seen in Balikatan 2025 exercises with U.S. forces emphasizing island resilience and multinational interoperability. Indonesia's Komando Pasukan Katak (Kopaska), the Navy's elite frogman unit, conducts underwater demolition, reconnaissance, and special operations tailored to the archipelago's vast maritime expanse, supporting sovereignty patrols and countering threats across 17,000 islands since its formation in 1962.

### In Africa and the Middle East

Marine forces in Africa and the Middle East primarily focus on securing vital maritime chokepoints, protecting resource infrastructure, and conducting counter-insurgency operations amid regional instability. These units often operate in environments characterized by asymmetric threats, such as piracy and terrorism, while supporting rapid response roles in unstable regions.

The Egyptian Naval Forces maintain amphibious units integrated within their overall naval structure of approximately 32,500 personnel, with specialized elements dedicated to securing the Suez Canal and conducting patrols in the Red Sea. These units undertake amphibious assaults, coastal defense, and protection of over 2,000 kilometers of coastline, emphasizing the defense of strategic waterways critical to global trade.

In South Africa, the Navy's Maritime Reaction Squadron serves as a small marine-like unit, comprising around 500 personnel following post-apartheid reforms that reestablished marine capabilities after the 1990 disbandment of the Marine Branch due to budget constraints. Established in 2006 and fully commissioned by 2008, the squadron focuses on amphibious operations, diving, small boat missions, and support for peacekeeping, including inland water patrols and anti-piracy efforts.

Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Navy includes marine units totaling approximately 5,000 personnel, concentrated on defending the Strait of Hormuz through asymmetric tactics such as speedboat swarming attacks. These forces, part of the broader IRGC naval structure of about 20,000 personnel, prioritize disrupting potential maritime threats and securing oil transit routes in the Persian Gulf.

Israel's Shayetet 13, an elite naval commando unit with around 300 personnel, functions as a marine-like special operations force specializing in coastal raids and counter-terrorism along the Gaza Strip. The unit has conducted targeted operations, including infrastructure destruction and hostage rescues in Gaza, operating across sea, land, and air domains to neutralize threats from maritime approaches.

## Historical Marine Forces

### Ancient and Medieval Periods

In ancient Greece, the Athenian navy employed epibatai, or marines, as specialized infantry aboard triremes to engage in boarding actions during naval combat. These epibatai, often drawn from the thētes—the lowest property class of Athenian citizens—numbered around 10 to 14 per trireme and were equipped with hoplite gear, including shields, spears, and swords, enabling them to leap onto enemy decks or support amphibious landings. Their role was pivotal in the Battle of Arginusae in 406 BCE, where the Athenian fleet, bolstered by epibatai reinforcements from allies, decisively defeated a Spartan-led Peloponnesian force of 120 ships, sinking or capturing about 70 despite losing 25 of their own vessels in a storm-swept engagement east of Lesbos. This victory, the last major Athenian naval success in the Peloponnesian War, underscored the epibatai's contribution to tactical superiority in close-quarters fighting.

During the Punic Wars (264–146 BCE), Roman naval forces integrated milites, or marines, primarily drawn from legionary troops and allied socii, to counter Carthaginian superiority at sea. These marines, typically 40 per quinquereme, were armed with pila (javelins), swords, and smaller shields adapted for shipboard use, and they excelled in boarding tactics facilitated by the corvus—a spiked boarding bridge that locked ships together for infantry assaults. In the First Punic War, their effectiveness was evident at the Battle of Mylae in 260 BCE, where Roman marines overwhelmed Carthaginian crews, capturing or sinking numerous enemy vessels, and at Ecnomus in 256 BCE, supporting the invasion of Africa by securing 64 prizes through close combat. Although the permanent Classis Misenensis fleet, based at Misenum, emerged later under Augustus around 22 BCE as part of the imperial reorganization, its precursor troop detachments during the Punic Wars provided the foundation for professionalized Roman naval infantry, emphasizing amphibious support for land operations across the Mediterranean.

In the Byzantine Empire, the Thema Karabisianoi represented one of the earliest dedicated amphibious military districts, established in the mid-7th century as a response to Arab naval incursions following the Muslim conquests. This theme, centered on the southern Anatolian coast and Aegean islands, combined naval and land forces under a single command, with soldiers serving as both sailors and marines on dromons—large oared warships equipped for ramming and fire projection via Greek fire. Active from the mid-7th century until its reorganization into the Cibyrrhaeot Theme around 720 CE, the Karabisianoi defended key Mediterranean routes, conducting raids and blockades against Umayyad and Abbasid fleets while supporting amphibious operations. Their dual-role troops, trained in both seamanship and infantry tactics, exemplified Byzantine strategic adaptation to hybrid warfare, maintaining imperial control over vital sea lanes until the theme's dissolution amid internal reforms.

Medieval Islamic naval forces, particularly under the Fatimid Caliphate in the 10th century, incorporated specialized infantry units aboard galleys and dhows for operations in the central Mediterranean. These naval infantry, often comprising Berber, Sudanese, or slave soldiers armed with swords, spears, and bows, functioned as boarding parties and assault troops during raids and sieges, with crews totaling 40 to 80 per vessel including up to 20 fighters. The Fatimids, establishing a formidable navy after conquering North Africa in 909 CE, used these forces to challenge Byzantine dominance, though their direct involvement in the 961 CE reconquest of Crete was limited; instead, earlier Andalusian and Ifriqiyan fleets had supported the island's initial Arab occupation in the 820s, and Fatimid ships later raided Byzantine coasts in retaliation for the Byzantine victory under Nikephoros Phokas, which ended Muslim rule on Crete. This era highlighted the infantry's role in amphibious projections, blending mercenary recruitment with tactical flexibility to secure trade routes and project power from bases in Tunisia and Egypt.

Early Ottoman naval efforts in the late medieval period, emerging in the 14th century, relied on ad hoc infantry from Anatolian and Balkan levies serving as marines on small galleys for coastal raids and sieges in the Aegean and Black Sea. These warriors, often irregular azabs or early Janissary precursors equipped with bows, swords, and light armor, supported amphibious landings during expansions, such as the capture of Gallipoli in 1354 CE, marking the Ottomans' first European foothold. Prior to the 15th-century professionalization under Mehmed II, the fleet's growth was gradual and reliant on Genoese and Venetian expertise, with infantry playing a key role in hybrid operations that foreshadowed the empire's later Mediterranean dominance, though limited by inexperience compared to established powers.

Norse longship crews from the 9th to 11th centuries operated as proto-amphibious units, with warriors doubling as rowers and marines during raids on England and France, leveraging the vessels' shallow draft for riverine incursions and swift beach assaults. These 20–30-man bands, armed with axes, swords, and round shields, conducted hit-and-run tactics from clinker-built longships carrying up to 60 fighters, as seen in the 845 CE siege of Paris, where Vikings under Ragnar Lothbrok navigated the Seine to plunder and extort tribute. In England, the Great Heathen Army's 865 CE invasion involved coordinated landings from over 200 ships, establishing Danelaw territories through sustained amphibious warfare that combined naval mobility with infantry shock tactics. This model of versatile seafaring fighters enabled Norse expansion, influencing European coastal defenses until the Battle of Stamford Bridge in 1066 CE curtailed major raiding.

### Colonial and Imperial Eras

The Portuguese Marine Corps, or *Corpo de Fuzileiros*, originated in 1618 as the *Terço da Armada da Coroa de Portugal*, a dedicated naval infantry unit formed to safeguard the empire's extensive maritime trade routes to Brazil and India amid growing threats from Dutch and English rivals in the 17th century. These marines conducted amphibious operations, convoy escorts, and coastal defenses, playing a vital role in maintaining Portugal's colonial holdings in South America and Asia through the 18th and early 19th centuries, including suppressing uprisings and countering privateer attacks along the Atlantic and Indian Ocean lanes. Following Brazil's declaration of independence in 1822, the unit was disbanded as Portugal's imperial focus shifted, marking the end of its colonial-era operations.

The Spanish Empire's *Tercio del Mar*, formally the *Tercio Viejo de la Armada del Mar Océano*, was established on February 27, 1537, by Emperor Charles V as the world's first permanent marine infantry force, tasked with shipboard security, amphibious assaults, and expeditionary support across the expanding empire. This tercio participated in key Pacific conquests, notably the 1571 expedition led by Miguel López de Legazpi, where Spanish marines stormed and secured Manila, establishing it as the capital of the Philippines and a hub for the trans-Pacific galleon trade that linked the Americas, Asia, and Europe for over two centuries. Throughout the imperial period, the unit evolved into the broader *Infantería de Marina*, contributing to naval campaigns in the Americas, Europe, and Asia until its restructuring in the 1930s amid the decline of Spain's global possessions.

In the 17th and 18th centuries, the Dutch East India Company (VOC) deployed detachments of soldiers and sailors as part of its private military forces to protect trading posts and enforce monopolies in the Spice Islands (modern Indonesia), conducting amphibious raids, fortifications, and counter-insurgency operations against local rulers and rival European powers. These forces, often drawn from the company's contracted personnel, were instrumental in conquests such as the 1621 capture of the Banda Islands, blending naval gunfire support with infantry landings to secure nutmeg and clove production. By the late 18th century, as the VOC declined financially, its colonial military elements were absorbed into the Royal Netherlands Marine Corps (*Korps Mariniers*), originally formed in 1665 as the *Regiment de Marine* for state naval operations, ensuring continuity in amphibious capabilities for imperial enforcement.

The Ottoman Corps of Marine Infantry, comprising *levends* (naval riflemen) and specialized sea-borne units, emerged in the 18th century as part of reforms to bolster the empire's naval capabilities amid Russo-Turkish conflicts, focusing on amphibious assaults and fleet protection in contested waters. These forces conducted operations in the Black Sea, including defenses against Russian incursions during the 1768–1774 war, where they supported galley fleets in boarding actions and coastal raids to maintain Ottoman dominance over Crimean Tatar allies and grain supply routes. In the Adriatic, marine infantry elements participated in campaigns against Venetian holdings, such as the Morean War (1684–1699) extensions into the early 18th century, securing island outposts through combined naval-infantry tactics. The corps was dissolved following the Ottoman Empire's defeat in World War I and the 1922 abolition of the sultanate, with remnants integrated into the new Turkish military.

Russian Empire naval regiments, formalized in the 18th century under Peter the Great as specialized infantry for the Baltic and Black Sea fleets, evolved into key amphibious assets by the 19th century, emphasizing landing operations and fortress assaults. During the Crimean War (1853–1856), these regiments, including reformed marine battalions, played a critical role in the defense of Sevastopol, where approximately 17 ad-hoc sea battalions conducted counter-assaults against Anglo-French landings, utilizing ship-to-shore tactics to repel invasions at key positions like the Malakoff Tower despite heavy naval bombardment. Structured in battalions of around 800–1,000 men each, equipped for both maritime transport and land combat, the regiments highlighted the empire's reliance on naval infantry for Black Sea operations until the war's conclusion exposed organizational weaknesses leading to post-conflict reforms.

### 20th Century Disbanded or Transformed Forces

The Special Naval Landing Forces (SNLF) of the Imperial Japanese Navy served as elite naval infantry units during the Pacific War, conducting amphibious assaults and island defenses from 1932 until Japan's surrender in 1945. These forces, drawn from naval personnel and organized into battalion- or brigade-sized units, played key roles in early campaigns like the Shanghai Incident and later operations such as Guadalcanal and Tarawa, but suffered heavy losses as Allied advances intensified. By 1945, many SNLF units were destroyed in combat or absorbed into defensive base forces, and the entire Imperial Japanese Navy, including its landing forces, was disbanded following the unconditional surrender on September 2, 1945, under Allied occupation terms that demilitarized Japan. Elements of SNLF amphibious doctrine indirectly informed postwar Japanese naval capabilities, contributing to the development of specialized landing units within the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force established in 1954.

The Manchukuo Imperial Army, as the primary ground force of Japan's puppet state in occupied Manchuria from 1932 to 1945, included specialized marine and riverine units under tight Japanese oversight to secure river borders and support anti-partisan operations. These marines, part of the broader army structure that grew from 111,000 personnel in 1933 to around 200,000 by 1945, operated primarily on the Amur and Sungari rivers, conducting patrols and limited amphibious actions in coordination with Japanese Kwantung Army detachments. Controlled by Japanese advisors who dictated training, equipment, and deployments, the units exemplified the puppet regime's role in extending Imperial Japan's continental defenses. With Japan's defeat in August 1945, the Manchukuo Imperial Army and its marine components were formally disbanded by Soviet occupation forces during the rapid collapse of the puppet state, leading to the arrest or integration of remaining personnel into Chinese communist or nationalist ranks.

The Republic of Vietnam Marine Corps (RVNMC), established in 1954 as South Vietnam's naval infantry, expanded to approximately 20,000 personnel by 1975, organized into one division with four brigades (147th, 258th, 369th, and 468th) focused on amphibious and counterinsurgency operations. During the 1975 North Vietnamese offensive, RVNMC units defended northern provinces like Quang Tri and Da Nang, evacuating around 4,000 marines by sea amid the collapse of Military Region 1, before retreating to positions northeast of Saigon and Vung Tau. As North Vietnamese forces captured Saigon on April 30, 1975, remaining RVNMC brigades disintegrated, with officers captured and sent to re-education camps, marking the corps' effective disbandment with the fall of the South Vietnamese government.

The Soviet Naval Infantry, reformed in 1961 as a dedicated amphibious arm of the Soviet Navy, comprised regiment-sized units across the four fleets for rapid assaults and coastal defense during the Cold War, peaking at around 16,000 personnel by the late 1980s. These forces conducted exercises emphasizing opposed landings and participated in limited operations, such as in Afghanistan, but faced reductions amid economic strains. Following the USSR's dissolution in December 1991, the Naval Infantry was restructured and inherited primarily by the Russian Navy, with units like the 40th Brigade at Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky realigned under the new command while retaining core amphibious roles.

Yugoslavia's marine units, known as the Naval Infantry Brigade within the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) Navy, consisted of about 900 personnel by 1991, serving as a coastal defense and amphibious force integrated into the Territorial Defense (TO) system for repelling invasions along the Adriatic. Formed from partisan naval detachments in 1944 and expanded during the Tito era, these units focused on light infantry tactics with limited landing craft support, participating in exercises to secure islands and ports. Amid the SFRY's breakup starting in 1991, ethnic tensions fragmented the JNA, leading to the marines' dissolution as republics like Croatia and Slovenia seized naval assets and formed independent forces, with remnants absorbed into the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia's navy by 1992.
