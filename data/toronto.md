## Introduction

Toronto is the capital city of the province of Ontario and the largest city in Canada by population. Located in Southern Ontario on the northwestern shore of Lake Ontario, Toronto serves as a major hub for finance, culture, and innovation in North America. With a population of approximately 2.93 million as of 2021, and over 6.2 million in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), it is one of the most diverse and cosmopolitan urban centers in the world [Statistics Canada](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/en/census/2021). Often referred to as the cultural and economic heart of Canada, Toronto is known for its iconic skyline, including the CN Tower, as well as its vibrant arts scene, multicultural neighborhoods, and significant contributions to global business and technology.

## Historical Background

The area now known as Toronto has been inhabited for thousands of years by Indigenous peoples, including the Huron-Wendat, Haudenosaunee, and Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation. The name "Toronto" is believed to originate from the Mohawk word *tkaronto*, meaning "place where trees stand in the water," referring to a historical fishing weir in the region [City of Toronto - History](https://www.toronto.ca/explore-enjoy/history-art-culture/history-of-toronto/).

European settlement began in the late 18th century when the British established the town of York in 1793 as a strategic military and administrative center. York was designated the capital of Upper Canada and grew steadily due to its location on Lake Ontario, which facilitated trade and transportation. In 1834, York was incorporated as the City of Toronto, marking the beginning of its transformation into a major urban center [Toronto Public Library - History](https://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/history-genealogy/local-history/toronto-history.jsp).

Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, Toronto experienced rapid industrialization and population growth, driven by immigration and economic opportunities. The city became a melting pot of cultures, with significant waves of immigrants from Europe, Asia, the Caribbean, and beyond shaping its identity. Post-World War II, Toronto emerged as Canada's leading financial and commercial hub, overtaking Montreal in economic prominence by the late 20th century [Encyclopaedia Britannica - Toronto](https://www.britannica.com/place/Toronto).
