## Overview

Iran, officially known as the Islamic Republic of Iran, is a country in Western Asia, historically known as Persia until the 20th century. Located at the crossroads of the Middle East, Iran is bordered by Iraq and Turkey to the west, Azerbaijan, Armenia, and the Caspian Sea to the north, Turkmenistan to the northeast, Afghanistan and Pakistan to the east, and the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman to the south. With a population of approximately 85 million as of 2023, Iran is the 17th most populous country in the world. Its capital and largest city is Tehran, a major cultural and economic hub. Iran spans an area of 1,648,195 square kilometers, making it the second-largest country in the Middle East after Saudi Arabia [CIA World Factbook](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/iran/).

Iran is renowned for its rich cultural heritage, spanning thousands of years, and its contributions to art, literature, science, and architecture. It is home to numerous UNESCO World Heritage Sites, including the ancient ruins of Persepolis. Politically, Iran operates as a theocratic republic, with significant influence from Islamic principles following the 1979 Islamic Revolution. The country plays a pivotal role in regional politics and is a major player in global energy markets due to its vast oil and natural gas reserves [BBC Country Profile](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-14541327).

## Historical Background

Iran's history is one of the oldest in the world, dating back to the formation of the Elamite civilization around 2700 BCE. The region became the heart of the Achaemenid Empire (550–330 BCE), one of the largest empires in history, founded by Cyrus the Great. The Achaemenid Empire is celebrated for its administrative innovations and cultural tolerance, as well as iconic structures like Persepolis [Encyclopedia Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/place/Iran/History). After the conquest by Alexander the Great, Iran saw successive dynasties, including the Parthian and Sassanian Empires, the latter of which was a major rival to the Byzantine Empire.

The 7th century marked a turning point with the Arab Muslim conquest, which introduced Islam to the region. Iran became a center of Islamic scholarship and culture during the Islamic Golden Age, contributing to advancements in mathematics, astronomy, and poetry through figures like Omar Khayyam and Avicenna. The Safavid Dynasty (1501–1736) established Shia Islam as the state religion, shaping Iran's religious identity to this day [History.com](https://www.history.com/topics/middle-east/iran).

In the 20th century, Iran underwent significant political changes. The 1906 Constitutional Revolution established a constitutional monarchy, though foreign influence, particularly from Britain and Russia, persisted. The 1953 CIA- and MI6-backed coup against Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh, who nationalized the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, remains a controversial event in modern Iranian history [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/19/cia-admits-role-1953-iranian-coup). The 1979 Islamic Revolution, led by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, overthrew the Pahlavi monarchy, establishing the current theocratic system. The revolution also led to the Iran Hostage Crisis (1979–1981), straining relations with the United States [U.S. Department of State](https://history.state.gov/milestones/1977-1980/iran-hostage-crisis).

The 1980–1988 Iran-Iraq War, initiated by Iraq's invasion, devastated Iran's economy and infrastructure, resulting in hundreds of thousands of casualties. Since then, Iran has faced international sanctions, particularly over its nuclear program, though the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) briefly eased tensions before the U.S. withdrawal in 2018 [Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/what-iran-nuclear-deal).

## Current Status and Relevance

Iran remains a significant geopolitical player in the Middle East, often at odds with Western powers and regional rivals like Saudi Arabia. Its government, led by a Supreme Leader (currently Ayatollah Ali Khamenei) and an elected president (as of 2021, Ebrahim Raisi until his death in 2024), blends theocratic and democratic elements. The country faces internal challenges, including economic struggles due to sanctions, inflation, and unemployment, as well as periodic protests over political repression and social issues, such as the 2022–2023 protests following the death of Mahsa Amini in police custody [Human Rights Watch](https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/09/22/iran-security-forces-violently-repress-protests-after-mahsa-aminis-death).

Internationally, Iran supports groups like Hezbollah in Lebanon and militias in Iraq and Yemen, contributing to its reputation as a regional power broker but also drawing criticism for destabilizing actions [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/irans-regional-influence-2023-01-10/). Its nuclear ambitions continue to be a point of contention, with ongoing negotiations to revive the JCPOA as of 2023 [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/15/iran-nuclear-deal-talks-what-is-the-latest). Iran is also a key member of OPEC, possessing the world's fourth-largest proven oil reserves and second-largest natural gas reserves, making it a critical player in global energy markets [OPEC](https://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/about_us/164.htm).
