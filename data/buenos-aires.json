Located on the western shore of the Río de la Plata estuary, it serves as the political, economic, and cultural heart of the country. With a population of approximately 3 million in the city proper and over 15 million in the Greater Buenos Aires metropolitan area, it is one of the most populous urban centers in South America. Known for its European-influenced architecture, vibrant cultural scene, and historical significance, Buenos Aires is a global city that attracts millions of tourists annually [Buenos Aires Tourism](https://turismo.buenosaires.gob.ar/en).\n\n## Historical Background\n\nBuenos Aires was first founded in 1536 by Spanish explorer Pedro de Mendoza as part of the Spanish colonial empire. However, the initial settlement was abandoned due to conflicts with indigenous peoples and harsh conditions. It was re-established in 1580 by Juan de Garay under the name \"Ciudad de la Santísima Trinidad y Puerto de Santa María del Buen Aire,\" which translates to \"City of the Most Holy Trinity and Port of Saint Mary of the Fair Winds\" [History of Buenos Aires](https://www.britannica.com/place/Buenos-Aires).\n\nDuring the 17th and 18th centuries, the city grew as a key port for the Spanish Empire, facilitating trade and the export of goods like leather and beef. In 1776, it became the capital of the newly created Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata, increasing its political and economic importance [Colonial History](https://www.history.com/topics/south-america/buenos-aires). The city played a central role in Argentina's struggle for independence, which was declared in 1816, and later became the national capital in 1880 after a period of conflict over its status [Independence of Argentina](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/argentina/).\n\nThe late 19th and early 20th centuries marked a golden age for Buenos Aires, fueled by massive European immigration, particularly from Italy and Spain. This period saw rapid urbanization, the construction of grand boulevards, and the development of cultural institutions. The city became a hub for tango, a dance and music genre that remains synonymous with its identity [Tango History](https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20131025-tango-the-dance-of-passion).\n\n## Current Status and Relevance\n\nToday, Buenos Aires is the political and economic center of Argentina, housing the national government, major financial institutions, and the country's largest port.
