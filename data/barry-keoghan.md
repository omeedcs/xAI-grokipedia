Keoghan's breakthrough came with supporting roles in Christopher Nolan's *Dunkirk* (2017) as a stranded soldier and Yorgos Lanthimos's *The Killing of a Sacred Deer* (2017) as a vengeful youth, establishing him as a talent in international cinema. He achieved wider recognition for portraying the dim-witted yet manipulative Dominic Kearney in Martin McDonagh's black comedy *The Banshees of Inisherin* (2022), a performance that earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor, a Golden Globe nomination, and a win for the BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actor in 2023.

## Early life

### Family background and childhood

Barry Keoghan was born on October 18, 1992, in Dublin, Ireland. He grew up in the Summerhill neighborhood, a working-class area in inner-city Dublin known for its economic challenges. His early years were marked by family instability, primarily due to his mother Debbie's heroin addiction, which led to him and his younger brother Eric entering foster care at age five. Over the next seven years, Keoghan lived in 13 different foster homes across multiple families, experiencing frequent disruptions that contributed to his later-described trust issues.

Keoghan's mother struggled to care for her sons amid her addiction, with vivid memories including her pleading through the letterbox for money. She died of a heroin overdose when Keoghan was 12 years old, an event that profoundly impacted his childhood. His father was absent throughout his life, with no public details about his identity or involvement, leaving Keoghan without a paternal figure.

Following his mother's death and additional time in foster care, Keoghan was primarily raised by his maternal grandmother Patricia, aunt Lorraine, and cousin Gemma, whom he refers to as his older sister. This extended family provided stability in his teenage years, helping him navigate the hardships of his formative environment in Summerhill.

### Education and initial aspirations

Keoghan attended O'Connell Secondary School in Dublin, where he first engaged with performance through participation in school plays, including a 2004 Christmas production titled *The Babysitter* during his early years there. However, his time at the school was marked by behavioral issues related to ADHD, leading to him being banned from participating in school plays for "messing around," which he later reflected upon as stemming from the instability of his early circumstances.

His initial interest in acting was sparked by watching films and observing performers, drawing particular inspiration from actors like Leonardo DiCaprio in *The Basketball Diaries* and Paul Newman for their naturalistic styles, which he studied informally before any formal training. Self-taught elements came through keen observation of local theater and cinema, as well as trial-and-error in casual settings, helping him channel personal experiences into performance as an outlet amid his turbulent youth. At around age 17, he joined the Belvedere Youth Club in Dublin, where daily activities including movies and music provided structure, and he began exploring acting more deliberately through community programs.

Keoghan's first amateur acting experiences occurred in school productions at O'Connell, where his energetic stage presence was evident despite later restrictions, and culminated in a lead role as Link Larkin in the youth club's 2010 staging of *Hairspray*, marking a pivotal shift from unstructured childhood instability toward disciplined creative pursuits. These early endeavors fueled his aspirations for a professional path in performance, leading him to enroll at The Factory (now Bow Street Academy), Ireland's emerging screen acting school in Dublin, around age 18 for formal training focused on techniques for film and television. There, he honed skills in a workshop-based environment that emphasized practical screen performance, building on his self-directed foundations.

## Career

### Early roles and breakthrough (2011–2018)

Keoghan made his professional acting debut in the 2011 Irish crime drama *Between the Canals*, directed by Mark O'Connor, where he played a supporting role as one of three young criminals navigating life in Dublin's North Inner City. The film, which took three years to complete after Keoghan joined via an open casting call at age 16, marked his entry into the industry and showcased his raw, naturalistic presence on screen. Following brief appearances in shorts like *Stand Up!* (2011) and the TV soap *Fair City* (2011), he gained initial television exposure in 2013 as Wayne, a volatile young gangster, in the fourth season of the RTE crime series *Love/Hate*. His portrayal of the troubled character, notably in a shocking opening scene involving animal cruelty, earned him domestic recognition in Ireland and opened doors to further opportunities.

In the mid-2010s, Keoghan continued building his resume with supporting parts in independent films that highlighted his ability to embody edgy, working-class youth. He appeared in the 2014 thriller *'71*, set during the Troubles in Northern Ireland, playing a young delinquent alongside Jack O'Connell, which introduced him to British filmmakers and expanded his international profile. Subsequent roles included the troubled son in the 2016 family drama *Mammal*, directed by Rebecca Daly, and a small part as "Windows" in the British crime film *Trespass Against Us*, opposite Michael Fassbender and Brendan Gleeson, further demonstrating his versatility in tense, character-driven narratives. These indie projects, often shot on low budgets, allowed Keoghan to hone his craft after brief training at Dublin's Bow Street Academy, where he studied acting fundamentals.

Keoghan's breakthrough arrived in 2017 with two high-profile films that elevated him to international attention. In Christopher Nolan's World War II epic *Dunkirk*, he portrayed George Mills, a young civilian volunteer assisting in the evacuation, appearing in a poignant subplot involving a civilian boat that underscored themes of sacrifice and innocence amid chaos. Nolan praised Keoghan's audition for blending "innocence" with "sophisticated truth and maturity." Simultaneously, in Yorgos Lanthimos's psychological thriller *The Killing of a Sacred Deer*, Keoghan delivered a chilling performance as Martin, a seemingly polite teenager whose manipulative actions unravel a surgeon's family, earning widespread critical acclaim for his unsettling intensity. Lanthimos described him as "the sweetest man, but [one who] can seem sinister and dangerous in a split second." For this role, Keoghan won the Irish Film and Television Award (IFTA) for Best Supporting Actor in Film at the 2018 ceremony.

Keoghan capped the year with additional notable turns in 2018, including the real-life inspired heist docudrama *American Animals*, where he played Spencer, one of four college students attempting a daring library robbery, blending humor and moral ambiguity in a narrative that blurred documentary and fiction. He also starred as Dympna, a ruthless enforcer, in the Irish crime thriller *Calm with Horses* (filmed in 2018), portraying a volatile figure in a rural underworld that highlighted his command of complex, antagonistic characters. These performances solidified his transition from Irish indies to Hollywood, establishing him as a rising talent known for his magnetic, unpredictable screen presence.

### Rise to prominence (2019–present)

Keoghan gained significant recognition for his breakout television role as the fictionalized character Pavel, a young Soviet conscript soldier tasked with euthanizing contaminated animals and affected by radiation exposure in the aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster, in the HBO miniseries *Chernobyl* (2019). His portrayal of the vulnerable and doomed miner contributed to the series' critical acclaim, highlighting his ability to convey raw emotional depth in historical drama.

In 2021, Keoghan made his Marvel Cinematic Universe debut as the immortal Eternal Druig, a telepathic leader with a brooding intensity, in Chloé Zhao's *Eternals*. The film, which explored themes of ancient beings intervening in human history, marked Keoghan's entry into major franchise cinema and expanded his global audience, grossing over $402 million worldwide despite mixed reviews. His performance as the morally conflicted Druig was praised for adding nuance to the ensemble cast.

Keoghan's supporting role as the socially awkward and endearing Dominic in Martin McDonagh's black comedy *The Banshees of Inisherin* (2022) solidified his rising status, earning him a BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actor and an Academy Award nomination in the same category. The film, set on a remote Irish island and delving into themes of friendship and isolation, showcased Keoghan's versatility in blending pathos and humor, contributing to its nine Oscar nominations overall. Later that year, he appeared in a memorable cameo as an incarcerated Joker in Matt Reeves' *The Batman*, hinting at potential future involvement in the DC universe through his eerie, scarred portrayal of the iconic villain.

Transitioning to leading roles, Keoghan starred as the obsessive and class-obsessed Oxford student Oliver Quick in Emerald Fennell's psychological thriller *Saltburn* (2023), a performance that garnered a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy and sparked widespread discussion for its provocative exploration of privilege and desire. The film achieved commercial success, earning approximately $48 million globally amid viral buzz. In 2024, he portrayed the hot-headed American pilot Lt. Curtis Biddick in the Apple TV+ miniseries *Masters of the Air*, a World War II drama produced by Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks, where his character's arc emphasized the perils of aerial combat. That same year, Keoghan featured in Yorgos Lanthimos' anthology film *Kinds of Kindness* as Robert, a police officer grappling with paranoia in one of the surreal, allegorical segments, further demonstrating his affinity for the director's dark, absurdist style. He also starred as Bug, a chaotic single father, in Andrea Arnold's coming-of-age drama *Bird* (2024), a role that blended tenderness and menace in a gritty tale of family and transformation set in working-class England.

In 2024, Keoghan starred as Jack in the thriller *Bring Them Down*, earning a nomination for Best Actor at the 2025 National Film Awards UK. For his role in *Bird*, he received an Irish Film \u0026 Television Academy (IFTA) nomination for Best Supporting Actor in Film in 2025. He has also been cast in the upcoming *Peaky Blinders* film, directed by Tom Harper, with a planned 2026 release.

Keoghan's career trajectory since 2019 reflects a shift from character parts to high-profile leads and franchise entries, bolstered by collaborations with acclaimed directors like Lanthimos and Fennell, and successes such as *Eternals*' blockbuster scale. In late 2024, he was cast as Ringo Starr in Sam Mendes' ambitious four-part Beatles biopic series, with filming underway and a planned 2028 release, positioning him at the forefront of prestige ensemble projects.

## Personal life

### Relationships and family

Barry Keoghan began a relationship with photographer Shóna Guerin in 2017, after meeting while out in Dublin. The couple dated for three years, with Keoghan crediting Guerin for supporting his early career, before parting ways in 2020.

Keoghan began a relationship with Scottish orthodontic therapist Alyson Sandro in February 2021, after meeting her at a pub in London. The couple dated for over two years, during which Sandro provided a grounding influence, reportedly uninterested in Keoghan's rising fame at the outset. Their relationship ended in mid-2023 amid reports of growing apart, though Keoghan has since described the split as amicable.

Keoghan and Sandro welcomed their son, Brando, in August 2022, shortly after Keoghan began filming *Saltburn*. The actor has shared rare glimpses of fatherhood on social media, noting Brando's resemblance to him and expressing pride in his son's charm. Post-separation, the pair maintain a positive co-parenting arrangement, with Keoghan praising Sandro as "an incredible mother" who handles much of the day-to-day care while he balances his career. He has acknowledged the challenges of their unconventional dynamic, admitting it differs from a traditional father-son bond due to his filming schedule but emphasizing his commitment to growth as a parent.

Following his split from Sandro, Keoghan began dating American singer Sabrina Carpenter in December 2023, after they met at Paris Fashion Week. The relationship, marked by public appearances and Keoghan's cameo in Carpenter's "Please Please Please" music video, lasted until July 2024.

As of 2025, Keoghan's most recent publicly detailed long-term romantic relationship was with Carpenter, with no subsequent long-term relationships confirmed.

In his adult life, Keoghan has credited ongoing support from his older sister, Gemma, and aunt, Lorraine, who played key roles in his upbringing after the loss of his mother during his childhood. Gemma, in particular, sacrificed her career to help care for Keoghan and his brother, fostering a close family bond that continues to provide emotional stability.

### Interests, philanthropy, and incidents

Keoghan maintains a passion for amateur boxing, which he pursued during his youth in Dublin, including participation in local matches with the Cashen Vale Boxing Club in Tralee at 60kg in the Senior B class. He has continued training sporadically between acting roles, citing it as a key interest alongside football during his formative years.

A lifelong supporter of Manchester United football club, Keoghan has a family connection through a second cousin who played for the team, which he has described as a significant influence in his fandom. He publicly expressed this enthusiasm by starring in the club's 2024–25 season kit promotional campaign alongside Adidas, featuring nostalgic imagery of matchday experiences.

Keoghan serves as a brand ambassador for Burberry, appointed in March 2024 to represent the brand's heritage outerwear. He also holds an ambassadorship with Barretstown, the Irish children's charity providing camps for those with serious illnesses, which he joined in March 2022 by launching its Aladina Studios for virtual programs.

His involvement with Barretstown stems from personal experiences in foster care, where he and his brother spent time in multiple homes after their mother's death, motivating his support for vulnerable children. Keoghan has visited the charity's facilities and highlighted its role in restoring confidence and joy for ill children, drawing parallels to his own challenges.

Keoghan advocates for mental health awareness and foster care reform, sharing in interviews how his upbringing led to trust issues and abandonment fears, while emphasizing resilience for others in similar situations. In January 2025, he co-led a UK government campaign with Foreign Secretary David Lammy to promote family-based care internationally, aiming to reduce institutional placements for children.

In April 2022, Keoghan was arrested in north Dublin for public intoxication and a related public order incident after neighbors reported disruptive behavior from an apartment balcony; he was released without charges, and his representative described it as an isolated occurrence.
