Founded in 2013, DoorDash has grown to become one of the leading food delivery platforms in the United States and has expanded its services internationally. The company operates as a logistics platform, facilitating the delivery of meals, groceries, and other items through a network of independent contractors known as \"Dashers.\" Headquartered in San Francisco, California, DoorDash plays a significant role in the gig economy and the broader food delivery industry, competing with companies like Uber Eats and Grubhub [DoorDash Official Website](https://www.doordash.com/).\n\n## Historical Background\n\nDoorDash was founded in 2013 by four Stanford University students—Tony Xu, Stanley Tang, Andy Fang, and Evan Moore—in Palo Alto, California. Initially named \"PaloAltoDelivery.com,\" the idea stemmed from a class project where the founders identified a gap in the market for efficient food delivery services for small businesses. Their early efforts involved manually taking orders from local restaurants and delivering them to customers, which helped validate the demand for such a service [TechCrunch - DoorDash Founding Story](https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/27/doordash-valuation-history/).\n\nIn 2014, the company rebranded as DoorDash and received significant seed funding from venture capital firms, including Y Combinator, which helped accelerate its growth. By 2015, DoorDash had expanded to multiple cities across the United States and began forming partnerships with major restaurant chains like Taco Bell and 7-Eleven. The company went public on December 9, 2020, listing on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol \"DASH.\" Its initial public offering (IPO) raised $3.4 billion, reflecting the high demand for delivery services during the COVID-19 pandemic [CNBC - DoorDash IPO](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/09/doordash-ipo-shares-soar-as-much-as-80percent-in-debut.html).\n\n## Current Status and Relevance\n\nAs of 2023, DoorDash holds a significant share of the U.S. food delivery market, reportedly accounting for approximately 65% of the market, surpassing competitors like Uber Eats and Grubhub [Bloomberg - DoorDash Market Share](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-18/doordash-gains-market-share-in-food-delivery-as-uber-retreats). The company operates in over 7,000 cities across the United States, Canada, Australia, Japan, and Germany, partnering with over 390,000 merchants. Beyond food delivery, DoorDash has expanded into grocery delivery through partnerships with retailers like Walmart and Albertsons, as well as convenience store delivery [Reuters - DoorDash Expansion](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/doordash-expands-grocery-delivery-with-new-partnerships-2022-08-04/).\n\nDoorDash's relevance has been amplified by changing consumer behaviors, particularly during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, which saw a surge in demand for contactless delivery services. The company has also introduced subscription services like DashPass, which offers reduced delivery fees for a monthly fee, further solidifying customer loyalty [Forbes - DashPass Growth](https://www.forbes.com/sites/steveolenski/2021/03/10/doordashs-dashpass-is-a-game-changer-for-food-delivery/?sh=3f1b2e5c6d4e).\n\nHowever, DoorDash has faced criticism over its business practices, including high commission fees charged to restaurants (sometimes up to 30%) and the classification of Dashers as independent contractors rather than employees, which limits their access to benefits like health insurance and paid leave. These issues have sparked lawsuits and calls for regulatory oversight in multiple jurisdictions [The New York Times - DoorDash Criticism](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/20/technology/doordash-delivery-fees.html).\n\n## Notable Facts and Details\n\n- **Leadership**: Tony Xu remains the CEO of DoorDash, guiding the company through its rapid expansion and public offering.
