# Stripe (Company)

Stripe is a global technology company that provides payment processing software and application programming interfaces (APIs) for online businesses, enabling them to accept payments, manage subscriptions, and handle financial transactions over the internet. Founded in 2010, Stripe has grown to become one of the leading payment platforms, serving millions of businesses worldwide, from small startups to large enterprises. Headquartered in San Francisco, California, with a secondary headquarters in Dublin, Ireland, Stripe is known for its developer-friendly tools and focus on simplifying online commerce.

Stripe's mission is to "increase the GDP of the internet" by providing infrastructure that makes it easier for businesses to operate and grow online [Stripe Mission](https://stripe.com/about). Its services are integral to the digital economy, supporting e-commerce, subscription-based models, and a wide range of financial operations.

## History and Founding

Stripe was founded in 2010 by brothers Patrick and John Collison, originally under the name "/dev/payments" before rebranding to Stripe in 2011. The idea emerged from the brothers' frustration with the complexity of existing online payment systems while working on previous entrepreneurial ventures. Patrick Collison, then a student at MIT, and John Collison, studying at Harvard, aimed to create a simpler, more accessible solution for developers to integrate payment processing into their websites and applications [TechCrunch Founding Story](https://techcrunch.com/2011/09/29/stripe-launches-to-simplify-online-payments/).
