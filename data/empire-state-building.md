# Empire State Building

The Empire State Building is a 102-story Art Deco skyscraper located at 350 Fifth Avenue in Midtown Manhattan, New York City, between West 33rd and 34th Streets. Standing 1,250 feet (381 meters) tall to its roof and 1,454 feet (443 meters) to the top of its antenna, it held the title of the world's tallest building from its completion in 1931 until 1970. Designed by the architectural firm Shreve, Lamb \u0026 Harmon and constructed by Starrett Brothers and Eken, the structure spans 102 floors and over 2.8 million square feet of rentable space, serving as an enduring symbol of American ambition and New York City's skyline.

Construction of the Empire State Building began on March 17, 1930, under the leadership of a syndicate of investors headed by John J. Raskob and former New York Governor Al Smith, who became the building's president. Despite the stock market crash and the ensuing Great Depression, the project progressed at an unprecedented pace, rising at a rate of 4.5 stories per week and finishing in just 410 days at a cost of about $41 million (equivalent to roughly $840 million in 2025 dollars). The building officially opened on May 1, 1931, with a grand ceremony attended by President Herbert Hoover, who pressed a ceremonial button in Washington, D.C., to illuminate its lights remotely.

As a pioneering example of skyscraper engineering, the Empire State Building was designated a National Historic Landmark by the U.S. Department of the Interior on June 24, 1986, recognizing its architectural and cultural importance. It features two prominent observation decks—at the 86th floor (1,050 feet or 320 meters above street level) and the 102nd floor (1,250 feet or 381 meters)—which draw over 4 million visitors annually and provide views extending to six states on clear days. The building's cultural significance is amplified by its appearances in over 100 films, including the iconic 1933 movie *King Kong*, and its programmable tower lights, introduced in 1956, which have illuminated for global events from holidays to sports victories. Today, equipped with 73 high-speed elevators and sustainable features like LED lighting retrofits and LEED Gold certification, it ranks as the eighth-tallest completed building in New York City (as of 2025) and continues to embody the city's innovative spirit.

## Site and Location

### Site Selection and Preparation

The site for the Empire State Building was chosen at 350 Fifth Avenue in Midtown Manhattan, occupying the former location of the Waldorf–Astoria Hotel, which had stood there since the 1890s. This prominent address was selected for its central position within the city's emerging commercial core, offering high visibility and convenience for prospective office tenants. The location's accessibility was a key factor, with direct connections to major transportation infrastructure, including the nearby 34th Street subway station and proximity to Grand Central Terminal, approximately eight blocks north, which facilitated commuter access and supported the building's goal of becoming a hub for business activity.

In late 1928, the Waldorf–Astoria property was initially acquired by Bethlehem Engineering Corporation for an estimated $20 million, as the hotel's owners sought to relocate amid shifting urban development trends. By August 1929, John J. Raskob, a prominent industrialist and former General Motors executive, organized Empire State Inc. to purchase the site for approximately $16 million, securing it through a syndicate that included former New York Governor Al Smith. This transaction complied with prevailing New York City zoning regulations, which permitted tall structures in the area under the 1916 Zoning Resolution, emphasizing setbacks to preserve light and air. The economic rationale centered on capitalizing on Midtown's growth, with the site's strategic placement expected to draw prestigious firms by minimizing travel times to key rail and subway networks.

Prior to groundbreaking, geotechnical surveys and soil testing were performed to assess the site's suitability for a supertall structure. These investigations identified layers of fill, glacial till, and alluvium overlying Manhattan schist bedrock, with the rock layer encountered at depths varying from about 50 to 70 feet below grade across the 2-acre plot. While the relatively shallow bedrock provided a stable base for deep foundations, it posed engineering challenges, including the need to navigate inconsistent overburden soils and ensure uniform load distribution to prevent differential settlement in this urban setting.

### Midtown Manhattan Context

The Empire State Building is situated at 350 Fifth Avenue, on the west side between 33rd and 34th Streets, within the Garment District of Midtown Manhattan's commercial core. This neighborhood, encompassing roughly 34th to 42nd Streets and Fifth to Ninth Avenues, serves as a historic hub for the fashion and apparel industries, blending wholesale showrooms, design studios, and office spaces.

In the early 20th century, the Garment District underwent a significant transformation from a mixed residential and entertainment area—previously known as the Tenderloin district with its theaters and hotels—to a bustling commercial center driven by the garment industry's expansion. Immigrant workers, particularly from Eastern Europe, flooded the area around 1900, shifting it toward manufacturing and trade as factories relocated from overcrowded tenements in Lower Manhattan due to new labor and health regulations. This evolution positioned the district as a vital economic engine, with the Empire State Building's presence reinforcing Midtown's role as a dense cluster of commercial activity.

The building has profoundly shaped the surrounding skyline, standing as a defining Art Deco pinnacle that anchors Midtown's silhouette and influences views from across Manhattan. However, recent urban development has challenged its visibility; in 2024, the 860-foot residential tower at 262 Fifth Avenue, under construction south of the site, drew widespread complaints for obstructing southern vistas of the Empire State Building from points like Madison Square and stretches of Fifth Avenue below 28th Street. At street level, the structure enhances pedestrian dynamics by drawing crowds to its base, contributing to the area's high foot traffic amid nearby retail and transit hubs.

Accessibility bolsters its integration into daily urban life, with direct connections to the 34th Street–Herald Square subway station serving the B, D, F, M, N, Q, R, and W lines, facilitating easy access for commuters and visitors alike. Its central location in Midtown's commercial core has historically aided tenant attraction by offering proximity to major business districts and transportation networks.

## Architectural Design

### Structural Form and Materials

The Empire State Building's structural form is characterized by a stepped pyramid shape that rises to 102 floors, a design directly influenced by the 1916 Zoning Resolution, which mandated setbacks to ensure sunlight reached street level and prevent overly massive structures from blocking light and air. This zoning law required buildings on lots like the Empire State Building's—spanning two acres at the base—to taper progressively, creating a series of recessed setbacks that define its iconic Art Deco silhouette while maximizing usable floor area within regulatory limits.

The building employs a classic steel frame construction, consisting of riveted steel beams and columns that form a rigid grid to support its height of 1,250 feet to the roof and 1,454 feet including the antenna spire. Cladding the frame is a facade of Indiana limestone and granite over 10 million bricks, providing both aesthetic elegance and additional mass for stability. The structure incorporates approximately 57,000 tons of steel, distributed across 210 columns anchored into Manhattan's schist bedrock, which collectively bear the building's total weight of about 365,000 tons.

Engineering innovations in the design emphasize durability against environmental forces, with the riveted steel framework and integrated wind bracing enabling it to resist lateral loads from high winds—tested up to 60-mile-per-hour gales during construction—while the overall mass and flexible frame contribute to seismic resilience, as evidenced by its stability during recent low-magnitude earthquakes in the region. These features tie into the exterior limestone cladding, which not only enhances the Art Deco aesthetic but also distributes weight evenly across the steel skeleton.

### Exterior Facade and Lighting

The exterior facade of the Empire State Building exemplifies Art Deco style through its use of Indiana limestone cladding, which provides a light, blonde-toned surface, combined with aluminum spandrel panels that frame the windows and add geometric detailing. These materials were selected for their durability and aesthetic harmony, with the limestone sourced from quarries in Indiana to cover the building's vertical bands and setbacks. Symmetrical setbacks, required by zoning laws, create a stepped profile that enhances the facade's vertical emphasis and integrates decorative motifs such as cast aluminum eagles and sunburst patterns at key entry points and spandrel areas, evoking themes of progress and modernity.

The building's lighting system originated with the installation of colored floodlights in 1976 to celebrate the U.S. Bicentennial, illuminating the tower in red, white, and blue for the first time and establishing a tradition of thematic displays. This halogen-based setup was upgraded in 2012 with a state-of-the-art LED system developed by Philips Color Kinetics, replacing 204 metal halide floodlights and 310 fluorescent fixtures to enable dynamic effects like ripples, starbursts, and rainbows in over 16 million color combinations. The LED installation allows for real-time programming via computer control, facilitating tributes such as purple and gold hues in 2020 to honor basketball legend Kobe Bryant following his passing. More recently, in October 2024, the tower glowed red in partnership with the American Red Cross to support relief efforts for victims of Hurricanes Helene and Milton.

Maintenance of the facade presents ongoing challenges due to weathering from urban pollution, wind-driven rain, and thermal expansion, which have caused limestone discoloration and aluminum corrosion over decades of exposure. Restoration efforts, such as those conducted in the 1990s after 60 years of service, involved comprehensive evaluations using scaffolding and probes to assess deterioration, followed by repairs including repointing mortar joints and applying protective sealants to prevent further water infiltration. Cleaning processes typically employ low-pressure water washing and gentle chemical treatments tailored for limestone to remove grime without abrasive damage, ensuring the Art Deco details remain intact while addressing seasonal buildup from New York's harsh weather. The 2012 LED upgrade also improved energy efficiency by achieving a 73% reduction in lighting consumption compared to the previous halogen system, lowering annual costs and environmental impact without compromising the tower's visibility.

### Interior Layout and Amenities

The Empire State Building comprises 103 floors in total, with office spaces primarily occupying floors 2 through 85, encompassing approximately 2.8 million square feet of rentable area. Above these levels, the structure includes mechanical equipment and observatory facilities. The internal organization follows a classic skyscraper layout, featuring a central core housing elevators and utilities, surrounded by office areas accessed via long corridors that extend to the perimeter; each floor also incorporates restrooms, service closets, and utility spaces to support daily operations.

The main lobby, located off Fifth Avenue on the ground floor, exemplifies Art Deco design with its high-ceilinged, narrow hall clad in marble walls banded horizontally in three tiers. Key features include aluminum reliefs crafted by artist Oscar Bach, depicting medallions that honor various tradesmen involved in the building's construction, symbolizing everyday labor and human endeavor, as well as a prominent aluminum silhouette of the structure itself set against a backdrop of radiating golden beams. A central chandelier from 1931, originally designed in brass and glass, illuminates the space, drawing from Beaux-Arts influences and restored to its original staggered profile using historic sketches.

The building's vertical circulation relies on 73 elevators supplied by the Otis Elevator Company, including high-speed express units that were among the fastest and most advanced of their era when installed in 1931. These feature ornate Art Deco doors with metallic geometric patterns, enhancing the interior's aesthetic cohesion. Amenities include ground-level retail spaces integrated into the base for commercial use, though the original parking garage has been discontinued, with no on-site public parking available today. In 2018, a dedicated visitor entrance opened at 20 West 34th Street to streamline access, separating tourist flow from office tenants. The elevators have occasionally been linked to safety incidents, underscoring the challenges of maintaining historic vertical transport systems.

### Spire and Upper Features

The spire of the Empire State Building, originally conceived as a 200-foot-tall mooring mast for dirigibles, was completed in 1931 as part of the structure's Art Deco design to facilitate airship docking and passenger transfers at the skyscraper's summit. This feature, intended to capitalize on the era's fascination with lighter-than-air travel, proved impractical due to persistent high winds at that altitude, which made stable mooring hazardous and operations unfeasible. Only a single brief contact occurred in September 1931, when a privately owned dirigible touched the mast for three minutes, but no regular use or passenger disembarkations ever took place, rendering the mast largely symbolic.

In 1953, the mooring mast was repurposed with the addition of a 200-foot television antenna, extending the building's total height to 1,454 feet and transforming the spire into a key hub for broadcasting. This upgrade supported early FM radio and television transmissions, with stations such as WABC-TV (Channel 7) and WCBS-TV (Channel 2) among the initial broadcasters utilizing the facility for over-the-air signals reaching the New York metropolitan area. Today, the antenna array accommodates dozens of radio and TV stations, underscoring the spire's enduring role in media infrastructure.

Above the 102nd floor, the upper levels consist of restricted mechanical spaces and dedicated broadcast equipment rooms, inaccessible to the public and housing transmitters, cooling systems, and maintenance access for the antenna operations. These areas ensure the functionality of the broadcasting setup while preserving the building's structural integrity.

As part of a broader preservation effort, the mooring mast underwent restoration starting in November 2019, involving the temporary removal of antennas and equipment to repair and clean its historic glass panels and aluminum fins, contributing to the overall $165 million redevelopment of the observatory experience. This work restored the mast's original Art Deco appearance without altering its broadcasting capabilities.

## Construction History

### Planning and Design Evolution

The Empire State Building was conceived in 1929 by financier John J. Raskob and former New York Governor Al Smith, who formed the Empire State Inc. syndicate to create a monumental skyscraper as a symbol of economic optimism amid the looming stock market crash of October 1929. This ambitious project emerged during a real estate boom in New York City, with Raskob envisioning a structure that would restore confidence in American enterprise following the financial turbulence. The initial plans called for an 80-story tower reaching 1,000 feet, announced publicly on August 29, 1929, shortly after the syndicate acquired the site of the former Waldorf-Astoria Hotel on Fifth Avenue.

The architectural firm Shreve, Lamb \u0026 Harmon was selected to design the building, drawing on the functional efficiency of the Chicago School for its steel-frame structure and the ornate yet streamlined aesthetics of the Art Deco style for its setbacks and decorative elements. William F. Lamb, the lead designer, incorporated vertical emphasis and geometric motifs typical of Art Deco, while the overall engineering reflected Chicago School principles of rational, height-maximizing construction pioneered in earlier skyscrapers like the Woolworth Building. These influences ensured the design balanced commercial viability with symbolic grandeur, prioritizing a central core for elevators and minimal ornamentation to expedite construction.

Design iterations evolved rapidly in response to the intensifying rivalry with the Chrysler Building, whose developers secretly added a 125-foot spire in October 1929 to reach 1,046 feet and claim the title of world's tallest. To counter this, Raskob and Smith instructed the architects to incorporate a 200-foot mooring mast for dirigibles atop the structure, elevating the total height to 1,250 feet and securing supremacy; this addition also transformed the upper levels into an observatory, finalized in the revised plans by late 1929. Although the syndicate had explored even taller configurations during early brainstorming, the August 1929 outline was refined over 15 iterations to optimize for height competition while adhering to zoning laws and material availability constraints emerging from the economic downturn.

### Demolition and Foundation Work

The demolition of the original Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, which occupied the site since 1893, began on October 1, 1929, to clear space for the Empire State Building. The process involved manual labor to strip down the structure, an arduous task complicated by the hotel's unexpectedly thick walls, which delayed progress and increased disposal challenges for the rubble. Demolition was completed in approximately two months, by early December 1929, allowing excavation to commence shortly thereafter.

Following demolition, foundation work started in January 1930 with excavation reaching a depth of 55 feet to access Manhattan's solid granite bedrock. Engineers employed concrete piers sunk into the bedrock to anchor the structure securely, providing stability against wind loads and potential settling under the building's immense weight of 365,000 tons. These measures were essential for supporting the skyscraper's height and ensuring long-term integrity on the urban site.

At the peak of these early phases, a workforce of over 3,400 men labored in two 12-hour shifts, utilizing scaffolding and basic shoring techniques to manage the excavation safely amid the site's constraints. The rushed timeline, driven by competition to claim the title of world's tallest building, demanded efficient coordination, though it highlighted engineering challenges such as proximity to nearby subway lines, which necessitated careful shoring to prevent ground collapses and disruptions to underground infrastructure. Despite these hurdles, the foundation was completed by March 17, 1930, when the first steel column was erected.

### Steel Erection and Completion

Steel erection for the Empire State Building commenced on March 17, 1930, when the first of 210 steel columns was anchored into the foundation, marking the transition from groundwork to the rapid assembly of the skyscraper's skeletal frame. Despite the onset of the Great Depression, which caused economic disruptions and material shortages across the construction industry, the project maintained an aggressive schedule, completing the entire structure in just 410 days by May 1, 1931. This feat was achieved through a fast-track approach where design elements evolved concurrently with erection, allowing adjustments to optimize speed without halting progress.

The steel framework rose at an unprecedented pace, with workers averaging 4.5 stories per week at the project's peak and achieving a remarkable rate of 14 stories in just 10 days during the mid-construction phase. The process relied on traditional yet efficient techniques, including the use of multiple derricks and cranes to hoist prefabricated steel beams into position, followed by hand-riveting to secure the connections; teams of four workers—typically a heater, catcher, bucker-up, and riveter—drove the rivets using pneumatic guns while balancing on narrow beams hundreds of feet above ground. Structural steel, supplied primarily by Carnegie Steel Company and fabricated by firms like American Bridge, formed the core skeleton, with integration of the limestone cladding beginning at higher levels as lower floors were enclosed to minimize weather delays. This overlapping of trades ensured continuous momentum, culminating in the steel topping out after approximately seven months.

The workforce, peaking at nearly 3,500 unionized laborers including skilled ironworkers, operated under demanding conditions typical of the era, earning about $15 per day amid the economic hardship of the Depression. Safety measures were rudimentary, with workers forgoing harnesses and relying on experience to navigate the heights, resulting in five reported fatalities from falls or being struck by falling objects. These efforts, coordinated by contractors Starrett Brothers and Eken, exemplified the era's industrial efficiency, transforming the site into a symbol of resilience during widespread unemployment.

### Opening Ceremonies and Initial Scale

The Empire State Building was officially dedicated on May 1, 1931, in a ceremony marked by national significance and attended by approximately 350 guests, including New York Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt and former Governor Al Smith. At 11:30 a.m., President Herbert Hoover, from the White House in Washington, D.C., pressed a ceremonial button that remotely illuminated the building's lights, symbolizing its completion and ushering in an era of modern skyscraper ambition. The event highlighted the structure's role as a beacon of progress amid economic uncertainty, with speeches emphasizing its engineering feat and potential as a hub for commerce and tourism.

Despite the fanfare, the building opened to subdued initial occupancy, with only about 25 percent of its office space leased due to the ongoing Great Depression, which had dampened commercial demand following the 1929 stock market crash. Nevertheless, it was immediately celebrated as the world's tallest structure at 1,250 feet (381 meters), including its mooring mast, eclipsing the Chrysler Building's 1,046 feet (319 meters) by over 200 feet—a deliberate design choice to claim the height record through the addition of the antenna-like spire. This vertical dominance underscored the building's scale and symbolic stature, positioning it as an unparalleled urban landmark even as economic realities limited its early functionality.

Early publicity efforts amplified the building's prominence, prominently featuring its innovative mooring mast intended for dirigible docking to facilitate airship passenger transfers, though practical attempts in 1931 proved brief and ultimately unfeasible due to wind and safety issues. The mast's promotion helped market the Empire State as a futuristic gateway, drawing public fascination. Further visibility came in 1933 with the release of the film *King Kong*, which depicted the giant ape scaling the building in its climactic scene, embedding the structure in popular culture and enhancing its iconic appeal during a period of low tenancy.

## Operational History

### Early Decades: Tenants and Tourism

Upon its opening in 1931, the Empire State Building attracted a diverse mix of tenants, including broadcasting pioneer NBC, which secured space for radio and early television operations that same year, as well as firms from the nearby Garment District seeking affordable office space. Government agencies also occupied floors, contributing to the building's role as a hub for administrative and commercial activities in Midtown Manhattan. However, the onset of the Great Depression severely impacted occupancy, with only about 25% of the 2.2 million square feet of office space rented initially, earning it the nickname "Empty State Building." To combat vacancies, management offered low initial rents, averaging less than $4 per square foot in the 1930s, far below pre-Depression rates for comparable properties.

The building's 86th-floor observatory, accessible via the grand lobby and high-speed elevators, opened to the public on May 1, 1931, and immediately proved a vital revenue source amid office struggles. It drew 17,000 visitors in its first four days, with telescope usage fees alone collecting over $3,000 in the ensuing six months. By 1938, the observatory generated $1 million annually—equivalent to about $18 million today—establishing it as a cornerstone of New York City's tourism economy. Into the 1940s, annual attendance reached approximately 2 million visitors, underscoring the building's transformation into an enduring attraction that outpaced its commercial leasing challenges.

Notable events highlighted the building's experimental features and adaptive role during turbulent times. In September 1931, a privately owned dirigible briefly moored to the 200-foot spire for three minutes in 40-mph winds, a promotional stunt intended to demonstrate the mast's viability for airship docking but ultimately deemed too hazardous due to unpredictable gusts at that height. The concept, envisioned as a futuristic transit hub, was quickly abandoned after this sole attempt. During World War II, the Empire State Building participated in blackout drills and dimmed its iconic lights to comply with coastal defense measures against potential submarine threats.

Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, the Empire State Building emerged as a potent symbol of American resilience amid economic hardship and global conflict, its towering presence and innovative mooring mast featured in promotional campaigns that emphasized engineering ambition and urban progress. Despite persistent vacancies, the structure's observatories and wartime utility reinforced its status as a beacon of endurance, drawing public admiration and fostering a sense of continuity in New York City's skyline.

### Mid-20th Century: Profitability and Challenges

Following the economic recovery after World War II, the Empire State Building began to overcome its early financial struggles. Opened amid the Great Depression, the structure had earned the derisive nickname "Empty State Building" due to low occupancy rates, with less than 25% of office space rented in the 1930s and much of the 1940s, as businesses hesitated to lease amid widespread economic uncertainty. By the early 1950s, however, postwar demand for office space allowed the building to break even for the first time, marking the end of nearly two decades of unprofitability and transitioning it toward stable revenue from rentals.

A significant event in 1945 tested the building's structural integrity when a U.S. Army B-25 Mitchell bomber, lost in heavy fog while en route from Massachusetts to New Jersey, crashed into the north side of the 79th floor on July 28. The impact killed 14 people—three crew members and 11 occupants of the Catholic War Relief Services offices—and ignited fires fueled by 400 gallons of gasoline that spread across the 78th, 79th, and 80th floors, causing an estimated $1 million in damage (equivalent to about $17 million today). Despite the 18-by-20-foot hole torn in the facade and debris scattering to nearby streets, the building's steel frame and fireproofing demonstrated remarkable resilience, with no compromise to overall stability; one engine even plummeted through the structure to the 33rd floor penthouse without causing collapse. The incident prompted investigations by aviation authorities, leading to calls for enhanced pilot training in instrument flying, stricter visibility minimums for urban flights, and improved weather reporting protocols to prevent similar accidents.

The 1950s saw infrastructural upgrades that bolstered the building's role as a communications hub, including the installation of a new antenna on the spire for television, FM radio, and emergency broadcasts, which expanded transmission capabilities for multiple stations and enhanced its appeal to media tenants. This period of growth continued into the 1960s, when occupancy rates climbed from 88.6% in 1964 to nearly 100% by 1970, driven by an influx of tenants from industries such as airlines (including regional offices for carriers like Eastern Air Lines) and media companies seeking central Manhattan locations.

By the 1970s, external economic pressures reintroduced challenges, particularly during the oil embargo-fueled energy crisis, which forced the shutdown of the building's iconic floodlights from November 1973 to July 1974 to conserve electricity, dimming its nighttime visibility for the first time since the early 1930s. The decade's recession further strained operations, with vacancy rates rising to about 10.5% by 1975 as broader market downturns affected leasing, though the structure's prestige helped mitigate deeper losses compared to its early years.

### Late 20th Century: Modernization Efforts

During the late 20th century, the Empire State Building experienced significant ownership transitions that influenced its management and development. In 1961, a syndicate led by Lawrence A. Wien, along with Peter L. Malkin and Harry B. Helmsley, purchased the property for $65 million, marking a shift toward investor-driven operations that emphasized long-term stability and revenue from both office space and tourism. This group retained control for decades, navigating economic fluctuations while preserving the building's iconic status. By 1994, Donald Trump acquired a 50 percent stake in the building through a partnership that provided equity financing for its prior owners, positioning him to influence revitalization efforts amid New York's recovering real estate market.

Modernization initiatives in the 1980s and 1990s addressed aging infrastructure to enhance safety, efficiency, and appeal. The 1980s saw efforts to manage asbestos-containing materials in line with emerging health regulations, though full abatement was gradual and integrated into ongoing maintenance. In the 1990s, a comprehensive $55 million renovation program updated key systems, including overhauls to the elevators for improved reliability and speed, enhancements to HVAC systems for better climate control, and replacements of single-pane windows with double-pane versions to reduce energy loss. These upgrades not only mitigated operational challenges but also supported the building's adaptation to modern tenant needs.

Tourism emerged as a vital revenue stream during this period, bolstered by targeted marketing campaigns that highlighted the observatory decks as must-see attractions. By the mid-1990s, annual visitor numbers reached approximately 3.5 million, reflecting a surge in international interest and contributing substantially to the building's financial recovery.

Economically, the 1980s office boom in Manhattan helped reverse earlier vacancies, with occupancy climbing to nearly 100 percent by the early part of the decade as demand for affordable Midtown space grew. Entering the 1990s, the building benefited from New York's tech sector expansion, attracting small and emerging technology companies as tenants alongside traditional firms, which helped stabilize leasing amid broader market shifts.

### 21st Century: Renovations and Sustainability

In the early 2000s, following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the Empire State Building implemented enhanced security measures, including airport-style screening in the lobby to check visitors and tenants for prohibited items. These upgrades were part of broader post-9/11 efforts to bolster physical security at iconic New York landmarks, incorporating reinforced barriers and surveillance systems. In 2007, the building conducted a pilot test of LED lighting for its tower, comparing energy-efficient prototypes against traditional floodlights to assess potential for widespread adoption in reducing operational costs.

During the 2010s, the Empire State Building underwent a comprehensive $165 million renovation from 2018 to 2020, led by Empire State Realty Trust and Skanska, which modernized visitor facilities and restored historic elements. Key upgrades included a new observatory on the 80th floor with interactive exhibits and immersive storytelling kiosks, enhancements to the 102nd-floor deck for improved 360-degree views, and the restoration of the Art Deco mooring mast at the spire's summit to its original luster. These changes, part of a four-year top-to-bottom redesign, also briefly referenced expansions to the observation decks for better accessibility and engagement.

Sustainability initiatives advanced significantly in the 21st century, with the building earning LEED Gold certification for Existing Buildings from the U.S. Green Building Council in 2011, recognizing its retrofit program that integrated energy-efficient windows, HVAC upgrades, and tenant metering. The Empire State ReBuilding project achieved a verified 38% reduction in electricity use through these retrofits, saving approximately $4.4 million annually and serving as a model for retrofitting historic structures. In March 2025, the building participated in Earth Hour by turning off its tower lights from 8:30 to 9:30 p.m., highlighting its commitment to energy conservation and renewable sourcing, as it has been powered entirely by wind energy since 2011.

The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted operations, but recovery efforts marked the early 2020s, with tourism rebounding and reaching around 4 million visitors annually by 2024. In 2022, the building hosted a Netflix promotional event projecting scenes from *Stranger Things* onto its facade, creating an immersive light show that drew crowds and symbolized cultural resurgence. By 2024, it illuminated its tower in red as a tribute to victims of Hurricanes Helene and Milton, partnering with the American Red Cross to support relief efforts in the southeastern United States. In 2025, the building hosted its 46th annual Run-Up on October 8 and illuminated in red, white, and red for Latvia's Independence Day on November 11, continuing its tradition of global commemorations.

## Height Records and Comparisons

### Architectural and Overall Heights

The architectural height of the Empire State Building is defined under Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH) standards as the vertical distance from the lowest significant open-air pedestrian entrance to the structural top, including the highest parapet, mechanical penthouse, or roof level, but excluding antennas, flagpoles, and other functional-technical equipment. This measurement for the Empire State Building is 1,250 feet (381 meters) to the roof of the 102nd floor.

The overall height, or tip height per CTBUH criteria, extends to the highest point of the building, incorporating unenclosed antennas and spires integral to the structure's function. For the Empire State Building, this reaches 1,454 feet (443 meters), including a 222-foot (68-meter) antenna added in 1950 to support broadcasting needs, which was later replaced in 1985, reducing the height from 1,472 feet (449 meters) to the current 1,454 feet (443 meters). The antenna atop the spire contributes to this pinnacle measurement, distinguishing it from the architectural height while adhering to standards that prioritize functional elements in total stature assessments.

The building comprises 102 floors above ground level, with 102 usable for offices, observation, or other purposes up to the 102nd floor, supplemented by additional mechanical floors housing equipment such as elevators and utilities. Under CTBUH classifications, the pinnacle height accounts for these upper mechanical spaces within the architectural top but extends further with the antenna for the tip measurement.

The base of the Empire State Building covers a site area of 79,288 square feet (7,366 square meters), equivalent to about two acres, with floor plates varying due to the Art Deco setbacks that taper the structure upward. Lower floors at their widest offer rentable areas up to approximately 100,000 square feet, while upper levels narrow to around 13,000 square feet, reflecting the progressive reduction in width from the five-story base to the tower sections. This design results in a total rentable floor area exceeding 2.7 million square feet across the building.

### Record Achievements and Losses

Upon its completion in 1931, the Empire State Building surpassed the Chrysler Building to claim the title of the world's tallest building at an architectural height of 1,250 feet (381 meters), a record it held uninterrupted for nearly four decades until the North Tower of the World Trade Center reached its roof height of 1,368 feet (417 meters) in 1970. This 39-year reign outlasted previous records set by buildings like the Chrysler Building. The addition of a 222-foot (68-meter) television antenna in 1950 extended the building's pinnacle height to 1,472 feet (449 meters), though this did not alter its architectural height ranking under contemporary standards; the antenna was replaced in 1985, reducing the height to 1,454 feet (443 meters).

The Empire State Building's supremacy ended definitively in 1973 when the Sears Tower (now Willis Tower) in Chicago topped out at 1,451 feet (442 meters) to its roof, shifting the global record westward for the first time since 1890. As the world's first structure with over 100 floors (102 in total), it also held that milestone until the completion of the 110-story World Trade Center North Tower in 1972. In its early years, the building quickly became a premier tourist destination, far exceeding other skyscrapers of the era and establishing it as New York's most popular observation site.

As of November 2025, the Empire State Building ranks as the 8th tallest completed building in the United States by architectural height, behind modern supertalls like One World Trade Center at 1,776 feet (541 meters). This position reflects the rapid evolution of skyscraper design and construction in the intervening decades, yet the building's enduring legacy as a record-holder underscores its pioneering role in vertical architecture.

## Tenants and Visitor Experience

### Notable Long-Term Tenants

In the 1930s and 1940s, the Empire State Building attracted notable media and government tenants amid its initial operational challenges. The National Broadcasting Company (NBC) became one of the earliest long-term occupants, leasing space on the 85th floor and the mooring mast for radio and experimental television broadcasting starting December 22, 1931, and maintaining a presence through the 1950s for transmission operations. During World War II, the building housed various U.S. government agencies, including offices for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), military personnel, and war relief organizations, which helped boost occupancy from its early lows of under 25% in the 1930s to nearly 98% by the mid-1940s.

Shifting to modern eras, the Empire State Building has become a hub for tech, media, and consumer goods firms with multi-year leases. LinkedIn occupied floors 19 through 21 (expanding to additional levels) in the 2010s, securing over 100,000 square feet for its New York headquarters with collaborative workspaces and employee amenities, signing a long-term deal that underscored the building's appeal to digital companies. Beauty conglomerate Coty Inc. relocated its global headquarters to the building in 2017, leasing approximately 88,000 square feet on multiple floors for executive offices and product development, following an earlier expansion in 2012. Media companies like Shutterstock have also committed long-term, leasing the full 20th and 21st floors (85,000 square feet) since 2013 for creative studios and operations, with renewals extending their stay into the 2020s. These tenants highlight a diversification into creative and tech sectors, alongside finance and government entities like the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which maintained over 100,000 square feet from the early 2000s until its relocation in 2025.

Lease trends at the Empire State Building reflect stable, mid-length commitments, with tenants averaging about seven-year stays across small- to mid-sized offices, driven by the property's renovations and sustainability upgrades. As of late 2024, occupancy reached 95.5%, blending tech innovators, financial services, and media firms in a portfolio exceeding 2.8 million rentable square feet. This high utilization generated approximately $177 million in annual rental revenues for the building in 2023, accounting for 29.6% of Empire State Realty Trust's total rental revenue and supporting broader economic vitality in Midtown Manhattan through job creation and local spending. As of the third quarter of 2025, the overall commercial portfolio occupancy stood at 90%, reflecting ongoing leasing activity amid market changes.

### Observation Decks and Attractions

The 86th-floor observation deck, an iconic open-air platform situated at 1,050 feet (320 meters) above street level, has welcomed visitors since the Empire State Building's opening in May 1931. This heated, 360-degree outdoor deck provides sweeping views of Manhattan and beyond, enhanced by coin-operated telescopes that allow guests to magnify distant landmarks such as the Statue of Liberty and Central Park. Surrounding the viewing area are interactive exhibits that explore the building's architectural history, construction milestones, and cultural significance, immersing visitors in its legacy as a New York City symbol.

Sixteen stories higher, the 102nd-floor observatory at 1,250 feet (381 meters) offers a more intimate, enclosed vantage point with floor-to-ceiling glass walls ensuring all-weather, unobstructed 360-degree panoramas extending up to 80 miles on clear days. After a $165 million renovation completed in 2019, the deck reopened on October 12 with modern upgrades including climate control, enhanced accessibility, and multimedia displays highlighting the building's engineering feats. Access to this upper level is via a dedicated glass elevator from the 86th floor, providing a thrilling ascent through the tower's structure.

From 1994 to 2015, the New York Skyride simulator ride on the building's second floor complemented the observatories by offering a virtual aerial tour of New York City, simulating a helicopter flight past key sights in a motion-enabled theater. Despite initial popularity, the attraction closed on December 31, 2015, primarily due to operational challenges including sidewalk congestion from aggressive promoters and confusion among tourists navigating the building's entrances.

The observation decks draw around 4 million visitors annually in pre-COVID years, generating significant revenue through timed tickets starting at $49 for adults to the 86th floor, with upgrades available for the 102nd level, as of 2025. High-speed elevators ferry guests from the lobby to the 80th floor, followed by express rides to the upper decks. Since the September 11, 2001 attacks, security protocols have included mandatory bag checks, metal detectors, and restrictions on large items to ensure visitor safety.

## Incidents and Safety Measures

### Aviation and Structural Incidents

One of the most significant aviation incidents involving the Empire State Building occurred on July 28, 1945, when a U.S. Army Air Forces B-25 Mitchell bomber, piloted by Lieutenant Colonel William Franklin Smith Jr., collided with the structure's north face at the 79th floor amid dense fog that obscured visibility. The aircraft, en route from Massachusetts to New Jersey, struck at approximately 200 miles per hour, penetrating the building and igniting fires fueled by approximately 400 gallons of fuel, which spread across multiple floors. The crash resulted in 14 fatalities: the three crew members aboard the plane and 11 occupants inside the building.

The impact also caused structural damage, including an 18-by-20-foot hole in the facade and the severing of elevator cables near the 79th floor, leading to a freefall of one elevator car approximately 75 stories (over 1,000 feet) to the sub-basement. The operator, Betty Lou Oliver, survived the plunge with severe injuries due to the cushioning effect of coiled cables below and emergency brakes, marking the longest recorded elevator freefall survival. Despite the destruction, the building's steel frame and masonry cladding prevented collapse, with repairs completed within three months at a cost of about $1 million (equivalent to roughly $17 million in 2024 dollars).

During the building's construction from 1930 to 1931, five workers lost their lives, mainly due to falls from heights amid the rapid assembly of the 102-story structure by a workforce of over 3,400.

The 1945 incident spurred advancements in aviation safety, including enhanced radar systems for fog navigation, stricter air traffic regulations over densely populated areas, and improved pilot training for instrument flying. It also prompted the U.S. Army to ban low-altitude flights in poor weather over New York City. No further aviation collisions with the Empire State Building have been recorded as of November 2025.

Following the September 11, 2001, attacks, the Empire State Building underwent structural inspections as part of citywide assessments of high-rises, confirming its inherent robustness with no major vulnerabilities identified, owing to its over-engineered 1930s design featuring redundant steel supports.

### Elevator and Human-Related Events

A more recent elevator malfunction took place on January 25, 2000, when an elevator plunged approximately 40 stories due to a sheared compensating cable, which helps balance the car's weight. The two occupants, Shameka Peterson and Joe Mesoraca, sustained only minor injuries such as neck and shoulder pain, thanks to the elevator's safety brakes engaging to halt the descent on the fourth floor; they were rescued shortly after.

The building has been the site of over 30 suicide attempts by jumping from its observation decks and upper floors since opening in 1931, with most succeeding until preventive measures were implemented. A particularly infamous case was that of 23-year-old Evelyn McHale, who jumped from the 86th-floor observatory on May 1, 1947, landing on a limousine below; her composed pose in death was captured in a widely published photograph known as "The Most Beautiful Suicide."

In response to a spate of suicides, including five attempts in three weeks following McHale's death, the building's owners installed 10-foot-high wire mesh barriers around the 86th-floor observation deck in late 1947 to deter jumps. These barriers, along with vigilant security, significantly reduced incidents, though rare attempts persisted, such as Elvita Adams in 1979, who survived after strong winds blew her back onto a ledge on the 85th floor.

On August 24, 2012, a workplace dispute escalated into the Empire State Building shooting, where 58-year-old Jeffrey Johnson fatally shot his former colleague Steven Ercolino outside the Fifth Avenue entrance before police intervened. In the ensuing gunfight, officers killed Johnson, but their gunfire wounded nine bystanders with non-life-threatening injuries, highlighting security challenges in a high-traffic area.

To mitigate such risks, the Empire State Building employs comprehensive safety measures, including extensive camera surveillance throughout elevators and public areas, staff training in mental health awareness and crisis intervention at observation decks, and mandatory annual inspections of all 73 elevators by certified agencies as required by New York City regulations.

## Cultural and Economic Impact

### Iconic Status and Symbolism

Upon its opening in 1931, the Empire State Building was celebrated by contemporaries as an emblem of optimism and resilience during the onset of the Great Depression, representing a bold assertion of human progress amid economic uncertainty. Its rapid construction and towering presence captured the imagination of architects and the public alike, symbolizing the unyielding spirit of American innovation. This status was amplified by its achievement as the world's tallest building for nearly four decades, a record that underscored its role as a pinnacle of architectural ambition.

The structure endures as a profound symbol of American aspiration, embodying the nation's drive for greatness and its capacity for renewal. Frequently illuminated in the colors of national flags to honor global events and holidays, it serves as a beacon of unity and cultural exchange. In the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, attacks, the building took on added resonance as an icon of resilience, standing firm as a reminder of New York City's enduring strength and recovery.

Economically, the Empire State Building bolsters New York City's tourism sector by drawing around four million visitors each year to its observatories, fostering significant revenue and reinforcing the city's global appeal. Ownership transitioned to Empire State Realty Trust following its initial public offering in October 2013, which valued the trust's portfolio at approximately $3.2 billion and marked a new era of commercial management. The building's legacy extends to environmental advocacy, as demonstrated by its participation in Earth Hour on March 22, 2025, when its iconic tower lights were extinguished for one hour to raise awareness about climate change.

### Media Representations and Events

The Empire State Building has been a prominent feature in numerous films, often symbolizing aspiration, romance, and urban grandeur. In the 1933 classic *King Kong*, directed by Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack, the titular giant ape climbs the skyscraper's spire in the film's climactic scene, fending off biplanes while holding Fay Wray's character, Ann Darrow, establishing the building as an iconic battleground between nature and modernity. This sequence, filmed using innovative stop-motion animation by Willis O'Brien, has endured as one of cinema's most memorable spectacles, with the Empire State Building's mooring mast originally designed for dirigibles lending plausibility to the aerial pursuit.

The building's romantic allure is highlighted in mid-20th-century cinema, particularly in Leo McCarey's 1957 remake *An Affair to Remember*, starring Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr. In the film, the protagonists, Nickie Ferrante and Terry McKay, pledge to reunite at the Empire State Building's observation deck six months after their transatlantic voyage, transforming the site into a symbol of fateful love and second chances. This pivotal proposal scene, set against the New York skyline, popularized the observatory as a cinematic rendezvous point, influencing later works. Similarly, Nora Ephron's 1993 romantic comedy *Sleepless in Seattle*, featuring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, culminates in a heartfelt reunion at the same location, where characters inspired by the earlier film climb to the top on Valentine's Day, reinforcing the building's status as a beacon of serendipitous connection.

In literature and visual art, the Empire State Building evokes the era's ambitious spirit, echoing themes from F. Scott Fitzgerald's 1925 novel *The Great Gatsby*, which captures the Roaring Twenties' excess just before the skyscraper's 1931 completion; the building's rise from the era's "valley of ashes" mirrors Gatsby's illusory dreams of wealth and reinvention. Andy Warhol further immortalized it in his 1964 experimental film *Empire*, an eight-hour static shot of the illuminated tower from the Time-Life Building, critiquing consumer culture and fame through repetitive imagery, now housed in the Museum of Modern Art's collection. Warhol also produced silkscreen prints of the structure around 1966, blending pop art's bold colors with architectural iconography to comment on American urban identity.

Special events have leveraged the building's visibility for cultural tributes, including immersive projections and lightings. In May 2022, to promote the fourth season of Netflix's *Stranger Things*, a 15-minute looping projection mapping show by Superbien Studio transformed the facade into the "Upside Down" dimension, featuring rifts, red lighting, and character silhouettes visible from blocks away using 46 laser projectors. In September 2024, following James Earl Jones's death, the Empire State Building honored the actor—best known as the voice of Darth Vader—with a red-and-black lighting and a projected silhouette of the Star Wars villain on its south side, marking one of the first uses of dynamic video projection technology on the structure. Annually, the building's tower lights participate in New Year's Eve celebrations, with multicolored displays broadcast on national television networks like ABC and NBC, drawing millions of viewers to the synchronized spectacle over Manhattan.

The Empire State Building's image is commercially licensed for official replicas, such as scaled models and souvenirs sold through the on-site official store operated by Hudson Group since 2019, which generates additional revenue alongside observatory admissions by capitalizing on the landmark's global recognition.

### Economic Role and Annual Traditions

The Empire State Building plays a pivotal role in New York City's economy, primarily through its observatory operations, which generated $129.4 million in revenue in 2023, underscoring its status as a major tourism draw. This income stream not only outpaces the building's office rental revenues but also contributes substantially to the local economy by attracting millions of visitors annually, who in turn support nearby retail, hospitality, and transportation sectors. The property's net book value was approximately $692 million as of December 31, 2023, reflecting its enduring commercial significance amid evolving real estate dynamics.

The building's economic contributions extend to post-pandemic recovery efforts, with New York City tourism reaching 62.2 million visitors in 2023—93% of pre-COVID levels and a 9.6% increase from 2022—fueled in part by attractions like the Empire State Building that drive spending in Midtown Manhattan. Office tenants provide additional rental income, accounting for approximately 29.6% of the parent company's portfolio revenues, further bolstering financial stability. These factors collectively stimulate adjacent businesses, enhancing the vibrancy of the surrounding commercial district.

Annually, the Empire State Building hosts the Run-Up race, an endurance event inaugurated in 1979 that challenges participants to climb 1,576 steps across 86 flights to the 86th-floor observatory. The 2025 edition, held on October 8, featured more than 200 runners from around the world competing in designated heats, promoting fitness and community engagement while drawing public attention to the landmark. Complementing this, the building upholds a tradition of illuminating its tower lights in thematic colors for holidays, such as red and green for Christmas, with displays running nightly during the season to celebrate occasions like Thanksgiving and Chanukah.

The structure also leverages its visibility for charitable partnerships, exemplified by the 2024 lighting in solid red to support relief efforts for Hurricane Helene and Milton victims, in collaboration with the American Red Cross. These recurring traditions not only foster public connection but also amplify the building's role in civic and humanitarian initiatives, reinforcing its economic and cultural footprint.
