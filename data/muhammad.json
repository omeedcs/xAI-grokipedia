  "content": "# Muhammad\n\nMuhammad ibn Abdullah (c. 570 – 8 June 632 CE) was an Arab merchant from Mecca who founded Islam, a monotheistic religious tradition that emerged within the broader Jewish and Christian scriptural environment of Late Antiquity and is today followed by nearly two billion adherents worldwide, centered on revelations he reported receiving from God through the angel Gabriel, which were later compiled into the Quran. Born into the Quraysh tribe's Banu Hashim clan, he experienced his first revelation around 610 CE while in seclusion in a cave near Mecca, prompting him to preach against polytheism and social injustices, such as female infanticide, prevalent in pre-Islamic Arabia.\n\nFacing opposition from Meccan elites who viewed his message as a challenge to their control of pilgrimage-related commerce and to the authority of their ancestral religious practices, Muhammad and his followers migrated to Medina in 622 CE—an event known as the Hijra that marks year 1 of the Islamic calendar—where he established a charter that sought to regulate relations among diverse tribal groups, including the region’s Jewish communities, and initiated military campaigns to defend and expand the nascent community. These expeditions, including the Battle of Badr in 624 CE and the conquest of Mecca in 630 CE, during which he ordered the destruction of approximately 360 idols in the Kaaba, unified much of Arabia under his leadership, gradually shifting tribal conflict patterns toward organized campaigns framed within developing Islamic concepts of collective defense and community expansion.\n\nHis death in Medina without issuing an explicit, broadly accepted designation of succession precipitated the political disputes that later developed into the Sunni–Shia divide, with ensuing debates over succession reflecting competing models of authority: communal selection versus hereditary claims through his family. Primary Islamic sources, compiled decades after his death, portray him as the ideal prophet and statesman, though modern historical analysis questions the reliability of these biographies due to their hagiographic tendencies and lack of contemporaneous non-Muslim corroboration for many details.\n## Early Life and Background\n\n### Birth, Family, and Upbringing in Mecca\n\nMuhammad was born circa 570 CE in Mecca, a key commercial hub in western Arabia dominated by the Quraysh tribe, which derived its influence from managing trade caravans and custodianship of the Kaaba shrine. He belonged to the Banu Hashim subclan of the Quraysh, a lineage noted for its custodianship roles but relatively modest economic standing compared to other Quraysh branches.\n\nHis father, Abdullah ibn Abd al-Muttalib, a merchant, died shortly before or immediately after Muhammad's birth during a trading journey. His mother, Amina bint Wahb from the Banu Zuhrah clan of the Quraysh, initially raised him with the aid of a wet nurse, Halima, following Meccan custom of sending infants to Bedouin tribes for health reasons; classical traditions attribute his early return to the ‘opening of the chest’ incident—a purification motif involving two figures in white—which reportedly caused his nurse Halima and foster family to fear spirit possession, prompting his early return (Ibn Ishaq, Guillaume tr., pp. 71–72); she died when Muhammad was about six years old during a trip to Medina.\n\nOrphaned at a young age, Muhammad was subsequently cared for by his paternal grandfather, Abd al-Muttalib, a prominent Quraysh elder who led him in tribal ceremonies and protected clan interests; Abd al-Muttalib died two years later, when Muhammad was approximately eight. Responsibility then passed to his uncle Abu Talib, chief of Banu Hashim, who treated him as a son despite his own large family and limited resources, providing shelter and protection while maintaining adherence to the ancestral religion, and involving him in caravan trade to Syria and Yemen.\n\nDuring his upbringing in Mecca's polytheistic environment, marked by tribal feuds, traditional Arabian polytheism at the Kaaba, and economic reliance on pilgrimage and commerce, Muhammad worked as a shepherd in his early teens and later as a trader, earning a reputation for honesty that later earned him the epithets *al-Amin* (the trustworthy) and *al-Sadiq* (the truthful). These details derive chiefly from eighth-century Islamic biographical compilations like Ibn Ishaq's *Sira*, which scholars regard as valuable for broad outlines but caution against for specifics due to their compilation over a century after events, reliance on oral chains prone to theological shaping, and lack of corroboration from seventh-century non-Islamic records.\n### Pre-Prophetic Occupation and Marriage to Khadijah\n\nIn his youth, Muhammad ibn Abdullah worked as a shepherd for several Meccan families, a common occupation that provided modest sustenance following his early orphanhood. Later, around his late teens or early twenties, he transitioned into caravan trade under the guidance of his uncle Abu Talib, accompanying commercial expeditions across Arabian routes, including to Syria, which honed his mercantile skills amid Mecca's economy centered on pilgrimage and trade. His reputation for trustworthiness earned him the epithet *al-Amin* (the trustworthy) among the Quraysh tribe.\n\nAt approximately age 25, circa 595 CE, Muhammad was hired by Khadijah bint Khuwaylid, a prosperous widow from the Quraysh clan's Banu Asad branch, to oversee her trading caravan to Syria due to his proven integrity. Khadijah, born into a family of merchants and known for her independent wealth accumulated through commerce in goods like leather, textiles, and perfumes, had been widowed twice and managed her ventures astutely in Mecca's competitive market. Her ability to inherit property, manage vast trade networks, and initiate marriage proposals demonstrates the significant legal standing and agency afforded to elite women within the pre-Islamic Meccan social structure. The expedition yielded exceptional profits, further impressing Khadijah, who—reportedly aged around 40—sent a female intermediary to propose marriage, which Muhammad accepted after consulting his uncle. Their union, conducted according to established Quraysh tribal customs without dowry from Muhammad, marked his entry into economic stability and lasted monogamously for about 25 years until Khadijah's death in 619 CE.\n\nThe couple resided in Khadijah's home in Mecca and had six children: two sons, al-Qasim (who died in infancy) and Abd Allah (who died young), and four daughters—Zaynab, Ruqayya, Umm Kulthum, and Fatima—who survived into adulthood. Traditional accounts attribute Khadijah's fertility to her age at marriage, though some historical analyses suggest she may have been younger (around 28), reconciling the timeline of childbearing with later Islamic biographical sources compiled over a century after the events. This marriage provided Muhammad with social standing and resources, insulating him from poverty while he contemplated spiritual matters in solitude before his prophethood.\n## Prophethood and Meccan Period\n\n### First Revelation and Initial Preaching\n\nMuhammad ibn Abdullah, aged approximately 40, retreated to the Cave of Hira on Jabal al-Nour near Mecca for meditation during the month of Ramadan in 610 CE, when Islamic tradition holds he received his first revelation. According to early Muslim biographical accounts, the angel Jibril (Gabriel) appeared and embraced him repeatedly, pressing him so hard that he reportedly 'thought it was death' (Ibn Ishaq, p. 106), before commanding *iqra* (\"recite\" or \"read\"), revealing the initial five verses of Surah Al-Alaq (Quran 96:1-5): \"Recite in the name of your Lord who created, created man from a clinging substance. Recite, and your Lord is the most Generous—who taught by the pen, taught man that which he knew not.\" Distressed and illiterate, Muhammad protested his inability to recite, but the angel insisted until the words were conveyed; he then fled the cave, convinced of madness or demonic influence. Sahih narrations from the same episode preserve Muhammad’s repeated plea ‘I feared that something had happened to me’ and his statement to Khadija: ‘I fear that I am majnūn (possessed by jinn / mad)’ (Sahih al-Bukhari 1:1:3 and 9:87:111; Musnad Ahmad 6:223 via ʿAʾisha – graded sahih by Shuʿayb al-Arnaʾūṭ), reflecting the intensity of the initial human reaction preserved in the earliest chains.\n\nReturning home trembling, Muhammad confided in his wife Khadijah bint Khuwaylid, who comforted him and declared his character precluded such deception. She escorted him to her cousin Waraqah ibn Nawfal, an elderly Christian (often characterized by scholars as a Hanif or belonging to a non-Chalcedonian sect) familiar with scriptures, who interpreted the event as the same angel that visited Moses and predicted persecution, affirming Muhammad's prophethood. Waraqah died shortly thereafter, before Muhammad received further revelations, so his endorsement was based solely on the initial experience. A brief pause in revelations followed, during which early traditions note this interim period caused such existential distress that narratives describe him ascending mountain peaks with intent to cast himself down, prevented only by visions of Jibril (Sahih al-Bukhari 9:87:111; Ibn Ishaq, p. 106), until Jibril reappeared with Surah Ad-Duha (93:1-11), reassuring him of divine favor. Witnesses described the somatic intensity of later revelations, noting heavy perspiration even on cold days and sounds like 'the ringing of a bell' (salsalat al-jaras), which Muhammad described as the hardest form of reception (Sahih al-Bukhari 1:1:2; Sahih Muslim 30:5763). Sahih narrations also capture initial terror during the encounter (Sahih al-Bukhari 1:1:3, via Aisha: ‘pressed so hard... feared for my life’), reflecting human response amid divine call (cf. SeekersGuidance.org on prophetic experiences). Following the initial encounter, subsequent arrivals of Jibril often induced intense fear, with Muhammad on occasion rushing home and crying out to his family, 'Cover me! Cover me!' (Sahih al-Bukhari 1:1:3). These accounts derive primarily from 8th-century Muslim sources like the sīra of Ibn Ishaq (d. 767 CE), transmitted orally earlier via figures such as Urwa ibn al-Zubayr (d. ca. 712 CE), though their compilation over a century after the events invites scholarly scrutiny for potential theological shaping absent contemporary non-Muslim verification.\n\nFor the first three years, Muhammad preached privately to kin and trusted associates, emphasizing monotheism (*tawhid*), rejection of polytheism, and social ethics, yielding around 40 converts including Khadijah (the first), his cousin Ali ibn Abi Talib (aged about 10), adopted son Zayd ibn Harithah, friend Abu Bakr ibn Abi Quhafah, and freed slave Bilal ibn Rabah. This secretive *da'wah* phase, commanded in Quran 74:1-5 (\"O you who covers himself [with a garment], arise and warn\"), avoided immediate tribal backlash amid Mecca's polytheistic Quraysh dominance.\n\nCirca 613 CE, Quran 15:94 (\"So proclaim that which you are commanded\") prompted public preaching; Muhammad ascended Safa Hill, calling Quraysh clans to witness against polytheism and affirm one God, reportedly declaring, \"If I told you that an army was behind this hill, would you believe me?\"—eliciting initial curiosity but swift derision from leaders like Abu Lahab, his uncle. Converts grew modestly among the vulnerable—slaves, youth, and women—totaling perhaps 70-100 by 615 CE, but preaching challenged Quraysh economic interests tied to Kaaba pilgrimage idols, as well as their conviction that the message was divisive to tribal unity and disrespectful to their ancestors' beliefs. Early tafsir and sira traditions (e.g., al-Tabari, Ibn Ishaq) record the 'Gharaniq' incident during this period, where Satan reportedly interjected verses praising Meccan idols, later abrogated by Quran 22:52—a narrative accepted by early historians but debated in later theology (see Shahab Ahmed, *Before Orthodoxy*, 2017), foreshadowing escalation. These details, while rooted in sīra traditions, reflect a narrative of gradual dissemination verifiable only through later Islamic historiography, with archaeological or external 7th-century attestations limited to Muhammad's existence post-632 CE.\n### Growing Opposition and Persecution of Early Muslims\n\nAs Muhammad began public preaching around 613 CE, denouncing the polytheistic practices central to Meccan society and commerce, opposition intensified among the Quraysh elite, who viewed his monotheistic message as a direct threat to their religious authority, the Kaaba's pilgrimage economy, and tribal prestige, as well as its divisive nature that fractured families and its active criticism of their ancestors and deities. Leaders such as Abu Jahl (Amr ibn Hisham) and Abu Lahab (Muhammad's paternal uncle) led efforts to suppress the nascent movement, initially through verbal ridicule and social ostracism, escalating to targeted violence against vulnerable converts to coerce recantations and deter further adherence. This opposition stemmed from causal factors including the disruption of idol veneration, which underpinned Quraysh income from trade fairs and pilgrims, and fears of social upheaval challenging established hierarchies.\n\nPersecution disproportionately affected slaves, women, and the poor among early converts, who lacked tribal protection, with Quraysh masters employing brutal methods to extract apostasy. Bilal ibn Rabah, an enslaved Abyssinian owned by Umayya ibn Khalaf, endured repeated torture including being laid on scorching sand under heavy stones while ordered to renounce Islam, persisting in faith until ransomed by Abu Bakr around 615 CE. Sumayyah bint Khayyat, an early convert alongside her husband Yasir, faced impalement by Abu Jahl, becoming the first martyr in Islamic tradition circa 615 CE after refusing to abandon belief despite prolonged beatings. Such acts, documented in early biographical sources like Ibn Ishaq's Sirat Rasul Allah, aimed to intimidate the community but instead highlighted the resolve of converts, though historians note potential hagiographic amplification in Muslim narratives.\n\nIn response to Muhammad's protection under uncle Abu Talib, Quraysh leaders escalated to collective measures, imposing an economic and social boycott on Banu Hashim and allied Banu Muttalib clans in 616 CE, formalized by a signed pact affixed to the Kaaba prohibiting marriage ties, trade, and social intercourse until Muhammad was surrendered. The clans retreated to Shi'b Abi Talib valley outside Mecca, enduring three years of severe deprivation, with reports of famine, infant mortality, and reliance on scavenged leather scraps, though non-Muslims like Abu Talib shared the hardship to uphold tribal solidarity. The boycott dissolved around 619 CE after polytheistic Meccan leaders, including Hisham ibn Amr, voluntarily annulled the pact driven by kinship obligations and a sense of justice, amid revelations of termite damage to the document—interpreted by some as divine intervention—and internal dissent among boycotters over its ineffectiveness in quelling the movement.\n\nDespite these pressures, the Muslim community grew modestly to around 70-100 adherents by 622 CE, bolstered by secret migrations to Abyssinia in 615 and 616 CE for refuge under Christian Negus Ashama ibn Abjar, evading further reprisals while Quraysh pursued extradition without success. Efforts to negotiate with Abu Talib, offering wealth or adoption of a Quraysh youth in exchange for disavowing Muhammad, failed, preserving his immunity under tribal customs until assassination plots prompted the Hijra. Traditional accounts, while primary from pro-Islamic sources, align with scholarly consensus on the existential threat perceived by Meccan polytheists, driving a cycle of resistance that solidified early Muslim identity through adversity.\n## Hijra and Medinan State-Building\n\n### Migration to Medina and Community Formation\n\nIn 622 CE, Muhammad orchestrated the Hijra, the mass emigration of his followers from Mecca to Medina (then Yathrib), prompted by escalating persecution from Quraysh leaders who had plotted his assassination following the deaths of key protectors like Abu Talib.  Emigration proceeded in stages beginning around May, with most of the roughly 150-200 early Muslims—primarily the Muhajirun (emigrants)—traveling covertly via coastal routes to evade interception, arriving over several months to join converts among the Aws and Khazraj tribes who had pledged allegiance at Aqaba in 621 CE. \n\nMuhammad delayed his departure until the final group, leaving Mecca at night with companion Abu Bakr; Quraysh search parties pursued but failed to locate them after the pair hid in the Cave of Thawr south of Mecca for three days, where tradition holds a spiderweb and dove's nest concealed the entrance.  Guided by Abdullah ibn Uraiqit, a non-Muslim hired by Abu Bakr for his expertise in safe desert paths, with 'Amir ibn Fuhayra providing provisions and support, they traversed approximately 260 miles northward, avoiding main roads and joining the migration route near Quba, a suburb of Medina, around early September. \n\nUpon reaching Quba on 8 Rabi' al-Awwal (circa September 622), Muhammad was welcomed by locals and oversaw construction of Masjid Quba, the first mosque in Islam, using mud bricks and date-palm trunks; he resided there for 4 to 14 days while Ali ibn Abi Talib retrieved remaining Meccan assets.  Proceeding to central Medina, his she-camel Qaswa halted at a burial ground site, interpreted as divine selection for Masjid an-Nabawi (Prophet's Mosque), which was promptly built with similar simple materials and served as both prayer space and communal shelter. \n\nTo unify the disparate groups, Muhammad instituted mu'akhat (fraternal pairing), binding roughly 45-90 Muhajirun with Ansar (Medinan helpers) as \"brothers in faith,\" entailing shared resources, inheritance rights (later adjusted by revelation), and mutual defense, which alleviated economic strains on destitute emigrants and fostered tribal transcendence in the nascent ummah.  This arrangement, performed in the mosque, marked the shift from a persecuted sect to a structured community with Muhammad as arbiter, enabling political consolidation that was later formalized in the Constitution of Medina, which established a confederative framework involving multiple tribal groups, including the established Jewish tribes of the region, amid polytheist holdouts. \n### Constitution of Medina and Relations with Tribes\n\nThe Constitution of Medina, drafted by Muhammad shortly after his arrival in Yathrib (later Medina) in September 622 CE, formed a foundational pact among the Muslim emigrants (Muhajirun), local Arab converts (Ansar), and the major Jewish tribes, including Banu Qaynuqa, Banu Nadir, and Banu Qurayza. This document, preserved in fragments across early biographical sources like Ibn Ishaq's *Sirat Rasul Allah*, outlined a confederation emphasizing mutual defense, internal arbitration, and religious autonomy within a unified polity termed the *ummah* (community). It comprised approximately 47 clauses, dividing into sections on the believers' community, Jewish alliances, and tribal obligations, marking an early shift from tribal feuds to a centralized authority under Muhammad's mediation.\n\nKey provisions included the declaration that Muslims and their allies constituted \"one community to the exclusion of other people,\" binding them against external aggression while prohibiting internal alliances with enemies of the group. The Jewish tribes retained the freedom to practice their faith and the right to bear arms for collective defense, with shared blood money (*diyah*) responsibilities and a mutual commitment to redeem captives collectively; disputes were to be referred to God and Muhammad as arbitrator. The pact explicitly barred aiding Quraysh adversaries from Mecca and emphasized loyalty to Medina as a sacred precinct (*haram*), fostering a proto-state structure amid ongoing tribal rivalries. Scholarly reconstructions affirm its authenticity as a composite of authentic early agreements, though debates persist on exact phrasing and whether it fully integrated Jews as co-equal \"believers\" or as allied polities.\n\nRelations among Medina's groups initially stabilized under the constitutional framework but deteriorated amid military pressures from Mecca, leading to accusations of covenant breaches by the Jewish clans. The Banu Qaynuqa, goldsmiths allied with the Khazraj tribe, were the first expelled in early 624 CE following the Muslim victory at Badr; traditional accounts cite their mockery of Muslim losses, an altercation where a Jewish artisan allegedly pinned a Muslim woman's skirt causing humiliation and a subsequent killing, and refusal to submit, prompting a 15-day siege and expulsion to Syria with limited possessions. This action, justified in Islamic sources as retaliation for violating mutual defense terms, weakened Jewish economic influence in Medina's markets.\n\nTensions escalated with the Banu Nadir, agriculturists controlling fertile lands, who faced expulsion in Rabi' al-Awwal 4 AH (August 625 CE) after the defeat at Uhud. Muhammad accused them of plotting his assassination by dropping a millstone from a rooftop during a negotiation, a scheme reportedly revealed via divine warning; they were besieged for about two weeks, surrendered, and were allowed to depart to Khaybar or Syria with movable property but without weapons or date palms, whose confiscation funded military needs as per Qur'an 59:5-6. Early sources frame this as a preemptive response to their incitement of Quraysh retaliation and treaty non-compliance, though numbers expelled vary from 40 to 600 families.\n\nThe Banu Qurayza, fortified smiths allied with the Aws tribe, met the harshest fate after the Battle of the Trench in 627 CE (Dhu al-Qa'dah 5 AH). During the siege by a Quraysh-led coalition of 10,000, they allegedly negotiated surrender to the attackers, providing potential rear access to Medina in exchange for reinstated dominance, breaching the constitution's defense clause. Post-victory, Muhammad besieged their forts for 25 days; upon capitulation, arbiter Sa'd ibn Mu'adh (an Aws ally wounded in battle) judged the men—estimated 400 to 900 in traditional accounts, though this figure is contested by some scholars such as W. N. Arafat who argue it reflects exaggeration possibly influenced by biblical narratives and suggest a smaller scale limited to combatant leaders—per Sa'd ibn Muʿādh’s reported invocation of the Tawrāt (al-Ṭabarī, Tārīkh, vol. 8, pp. 35–38: ‘I judge them by what is in the Tawrāt’; cf. Ibn Kathīr, Tafsīr on 33:26–27 and ICRAA.org, ‘The Fate of Banu Qurayza’, noting Sa'd’s reference to Deut. 20:10–15 while highlighting textual and contextual variances in application), resulting in executions, while women and children were enslaved and property seized. Islamic traditions, drawing from Ibn Ishaq and hadith collections, portray this as judicial enforcement of the Torah against betrayal in wartime, corroborated by the tribe's strategic position enabling the treachery; non-Muslim analyses note the severity but affirm the event's historicity based on consistent early narratives. These episodes consolidated Muslim authority, redistributing resources and eliminating internal threats, though reliant on sira literature prone to retrospective idealization.\n## Military Engagements and Conquests\n\n### Key Battles: Badr, Uhud, and the Trench\n\nThe Battle of Badr, fought on 17 Ramadan 2 AH (approximately March 13–17, 624 CE), marked the first major military confrontation between the Muslims of Medina and the Quraysh of Mecca. Muhammad led a force of about 313–317 fighters, including 82 emigrants from Mecca and the rest Medinans, equipped with only 2 horses and 70 camels shared among them, against a Meccan army of roughly 950–1,000 men under Abu Sufyan ibn Harb, motivated by retaliation for systematic raids on Meccan merchant caravans (ghazw) and the earlier Muslim raids. The Muslims positioned themselves near the wells of Badr, denying water to the Meccans, and employed superior morale and tactical discipline, including a central charge led by Muhammad himself, resulting in a decisive victory: approximately 70 Meccans killed (including key leaders like Abu Jahl) and 70 captured, while Muslim losses totaled 14 killed. Traditional Muslim sources attribute the outcome to divine support, but causal factors included the Muslims' defensive terrain advantage and the Meccans' overconfidence following initial skirmishes; scholarly analysis notes that sira accounts, compiled over a century later by Ibn Ishaq, may amplify numerical disparities for inspirational effect, though the battle's occurrence and Muslim success are broadly accepted as historical.\n\nThe Battle of Uhud, occurring on 7 Shawwal 3 AH (March 23, 625 CE), represented a reversal for the Muslims against a larger Meccan force seeking vengeance for Badr. Muhammad assembled around 700–1,000 fighters (after some tribes withdrew), facing 3,000 Quraysh troops led by Abu Sufyan, bolstered by 200 cavalry and women rallying morale through traditional war songs, led by Hind bint Utbah. Initial Muslim advances overwhelmed the Meccan center, killing figures like Talha ibn Abi Talha, but 50 archers stationed on Uhud's slopes disobeyed orders to hold position upon perceiving victory, allowing Khalid ibn al-Walid's cavalry to flank and rout the unprotected rear, leading to chaos and Muhammad sustaining minor wounds. The outcome was a tactical Meccan success but strategic stalemate, with 70 Muslims killed (including Hamza ibn Abd al-Muttalib) and 22–37 Meccans slain; sources like Ibn Ishaq emphasize disobedience as the causal failure, while modern analyses highlight leadership errors and the archers' greed for spoils as key, underscoring the unreliability of over-reliant infantry without cavalry balance.\n\nThe Battle of the Trench (al-Khandaq), in Shawwal 5 AH (April 627 CE), shifted to defensive strategy amid a confederate alliance of 10,000 warriors from Quraysh, Ghatafan, and others, allied with Medina's Jewish Banu Qurayza tribe, aiming to eradicate the Muslim community. Muhammad, with 3,000 fighters, adopted Salman al-Farsi's Persian-inspired tactic of digging a 3–5 km trench (about 4.5–9 meters deep and wide) around Medina's vulnerable northern flank over six days, frustrating cavalry charges in unfamiliar Arabian warfare. The two-week siege stalled due to harsh weather, supply shortages, and strategic deception by convert Nuaym ibn Masud (psychological warfare), who sowed distrust among the confederates, Banu Qurayza, and Abu Sufyan by false reports of betrayal, prompting the coalition's withdrawal without major engagement—only 5–6 Muslim and 3 enemy casualties reported. Traditional narratives credit a providential storm, but empirically, the trench's innovation, diplomatic subversion, and logistical strains causally broke the siege; as with prior battles, primary sira sources risk hagiographic inflation of enemy numbers, yet the event's defensive success is corroborated across early Islamic historiography as pivotal in securing Medina.\n### Later Expeditions, Treaty of Hudaybiyyah, and Conquest of Mecca\n\nFollowing the Battle of the Trench in April 627 CE (5 AH), Muhammad authorized expeditions against remaining Jewish tribes in Medina and nearby oases, including the siege of the Banu Qurayza tribe for approximately 25 days later that year. After their alleged treason during the siege, the tribe surrendered unconditionally, and an arbitrator from the Aws tribe, Sa'd ibn Mu'adh, ruled that approximately 600 to 900 adult males be executed, with women and children enslaved or ransomed, and property divided among the Muslims, per Sa'd's reported invocation of Jewish law (Tawrat; al-Tabari, Tarikh, Vol. 8, pp. 35-38: 'judged by what is in the Tawrat'; cf. Ibn Kathir, Tafsir on 33:26-27: Mosaic penalty for treasonous combatants, akin to Deut. 20:10-14; classical sources preserve Sa'd's explicit reference to the Tawrāt (al-Tabarī, Tārīkh, vol. 8, p. 38; Ibn Hishām, Sīra, vol. 2, p. 240), yet modern scholarship notes significant differences in application from Deut. 20:10-15 and 21:10-14, such as absence of mandatory peace offer or mourning period for female captives)—as preserved in sahih chains (Sahih al-Bukhari 5:58:148, via Anas ibn Malik); Muhammad approved the judgment as aligning with divine will. Classical reports note women and children as captives (Ibn Ishaq, Sira, ed. Ibn Hisham, Vol. 2, pp. 240-241: ~1,000 enslaved, per Aws ally chains; cf. SeekersGuidance.org on Mosaic parallels, Deut. 20:14)—amid debates on transmission variances (al-Tabari, Vol. 8, p. 38: ransom options debated), illustrating sira/hadith ambiguities. This event consolidated Muslim control over Medina by eliminating internal threats.\n\nIn May 628 CE (Muharram 7 AH), Muhammad led an expedition of about 1,600 men against the Jewish stronghold of Khaybar, defeating its defenders after a prolonged siege and securing an annual tribute of half their produce in dates and grains. Further raids, known as *sariyyah*, targeted Bedouin tribes such as the Banu Lihyan and Ghatafan to enforce alliances or extract reparations, reflecting a strategy of deterrence and economic pressure rather than forced conversion, as early Muslim chronicles emphasize submission to Medina's authority over proselytizing. These actions expanded Muhammad's influence across northern Arabia amid ongoing skirmishes.\n\nIn March 628 CE (Dhu al-Qa'dah 6 AH), Muhammad set out from Medina with around 1,400 unarmed followers intending to perform *umrah* (lesser pilgrimage) in Mecca, but Quraysh forces, driven by security concerns regarding the mass entry of a rival political faction, blocked them at Hudaybiyyah, a site 20 kilometers from the city. Negotiations, mediated by figures like Suhayl ibn Amr, resulted in a treaty stipulating a ten-year truce, cessation of hostilities, the return of Meccan fugitives to Quraysh (excluding women who later fled), no new alliances without consent, and permission for Muslims to perform *umrah* the following year for three days without arms. Notably, the document omitted Muhammad's prophetic title, listing him only as \"Muhammad son of Abdullah,\" a concession perceived by some companions as humiliating but strategically allowing peaceful propagation of Islam. The truce enabled rapid Muslim growth, with tribes converting en masse, as tribal allegiances shifted toward the ascendant Medinan state.\n\nThe treaty's violation occurred in 630 CE (7 AH) when Quraysh allies, the Banu Bakr tribe, attacked the Muslim-allied Banu Khuza'ah near the Hudaybiyyah well, killing several despite the truce's prohibition on warfare. Muhammad issued a 10-day ultimatum demanding reparations, which Quraysh rejected, abrogating the pact under its own terms. In response, he mobilized an army of 10,000, including recent converts, and advanced on Mecca in December 629–January 630 CE (Ramadan 8 AH), entering the city with minimal resistance after Abu Sufyan, as a tribal chief negotiating to prevent the destruction of the city and its inhabitants, converted and provided safe-conduct pledges. Muhammad declared a general amnesty, sparing most opponents except a few direct enemies, and proceeded to the Kaaba to engage in iconoclasm by removing its 360 deities representing the diverse tribal pantheons of Arabia, marking the transition from religious pluralism to monotheism. The conquest, largely bloodless with only about a dozen casualties, marked the subjugation of Quraysh and the unification of the Hejaz under Islamic rule, prompting widespread tribal submissions.\n## Personal Life and Character\n\n### Marriages, Concubines, and Family Dynamics\n\nMuhammad's first marriage was to Khadijah bint Khuwaylid, a wealthy Meccan merchant widow approximately 40 years old, in 595 CE when he was 25; they remained monogamous for 25 years until her death in 619 CE shortly before the Hijra. Khadijah bore him six children: three sons (Qasim, who died in infancy around 601 CE; and two others, Tayyib and Tahir, who also died young) and four daughters (Zaynab, Ruqayyah, Umm Kulthum, and Fatimah). No children survived from his later unions except Ibrahim, born to a concubine in 630 CE.\n\nFollowing Khadijah's death, Muhammad contracted multiple marriages, primarily after the Hijra in 622 CE, totaling 11 wives according to traditional accounts in Hadith collections like Sahih al-Bukhari and Sahih Muslim; these were often widows or captives from tribal alliances, with exceptions like Aisha. The marriages served political and social functions, such as forging alliances with tribes or providing for war widows, though Quran 33:50-52 granted Muhammad exemptions from the four-wife limit imposed on other Muslim men (Quran 4:3).\n\n| Wife | Approximate Marriage Date | Notes |\n|------|---------------------------|-------|\n| Sawdah bint Zam'ah | 620 CE | Widow, elderly at marriage; first post-Khadijah union for companionship. |\n| Aisha bint Abi Bakr | Betrothal 620 CE; consummation 623 CE | Daughter of Abu Bakr; Hadith report her age as 6 at betrothal and 9 at consummation, though some modern analyses, representing a minority view, contest this based on alternative historical timelines. |\n| Hafsa bint Umar | 625 CE | Widow of Khunays ibn Hudhayfa, killed at Badr; daughter of Umar. |\n| Zaynab bint Khuzaymah | 625 CE | Widow; died shortly after marriage in 626 CE. |\n| Hind (Umm Salama) bint Abi Umayyah | 626 CE | Widow of Abu Salamah; mother of several children. |\n| Zaynab bint Jahsh | 627 CE | Divorced wife of adopted son Zayd; marriage prompted Quran 33:37 abrogating adoption ties. |\n| Juwayriyah bint al-Harith | 628 CE | Captive from Banu Mustaliq; marriage led to her tribe's release. |\n| Umm Habibah (Ramla) bint Abi Sufyan | 628 CE | Widow exiled in Abyssinia; daughter of Abu Sufyan, aiding Meccan reconciliation. |\n| Safiyyah bint Huyayy | 628 CE | Jewish captive from Khaybar, daughter of Huyayy ibn Akhtab, chief of Banu Nadir; husband killed at Khaybar; converted to Islam. |\n| Maymunah bint al-Harith | 629 CE | Widow; last marriage, during Umrah. |\n\nMuhammad also had concubines, including Maria al-Qibtiyya, a Coptic Christian gifted by the Egyptian ruler al-Muqawqis in 628 CE, who bore son Ibrahim (died 632 CE at 18 months); she is classified as a concubine rather than wife in major Sunni sources, lacking the \"Mother of the Believers\" status. Rayhana bint Zayd, a Jewish captive from Banu Qurayza in 627 CE, was another, with debated status as wife or concubine. Early biographical sources, such as Ibn Ishaq, report that she initially refused to convert to Islam, preferring to remain in her ancestral faith, before later accepting Islam. These relationships aligned with pre-Islamic Arabian norms of concubinage from captives or gifts, regulated under \"those your right hands possess\" (Quran 4:24, 23:6)—explicitly permitting relations 'with your wives to whom you have given their due compensation and those your right hands possess' (Quran 23:6).\n\nFamily dynamics involved tensions from polygyny, including jealousy among wives, particularly toward younger Aisha and concubine Maria. A notable incident around 628 CE involved Hafsa discovering Muhammad with Maria in her quarters; Hafsa informed Aisha, leading to the wives confronting him,—prompting Muhammad's withdrawal and oath of abstention (īlā’) from all his wives for twenty-nine days due to anger (Sahih al-Bukhari 5191 and 2468; Sahih Muslim 1479a-c via Umar and Aisha), an event directly linked to the revelation of Surah al-Tahrim (66:1-5) and discussions of prophetic patience. after which he temporarily forswore honey (or intimacy with Maria) to appease them, prompting the revelation of Surah al-Tahrim (Quran 66:1-5). Sahih narrations from Aisha detail the ensuing tension, where the wives—including Umm Salamah—united in protest, prompting Muhammad to swear off honey (or Maria) temporarily; Aisha later reflected: 'We said nothing except that he (the Prophet) received a revelation about it, and then recited to us: \"Why do you take to oath concerning the loving ones among your wives?\" (Quran 66:1)' (Sahih al-Bukhari 6:60:311; Sahih Muslim 9:3496 via Aisha). rebuking their conspiracy and reminding them of potential divorce. Hadith depict Aisha expressing rivalry, such as breaking a bowl out of envy or questioning favoritism, though Muhammad maintained equity in time allocation per Hadith reports of visiting all nine wives in one night. These accounts, drawn from Sahih al-Bukhari and Muslim, reflect traditional Sunni views but originate from oral chains compiled over a century later, with varying scholarly scrutiny on transmission reliability.\n### Reported Habits, Traits, and Interactions\n\nMuhammad was reported to have been of medium height, with a sturdy build, broad shoulders, and a face that was luminous and slightly flushed. His hair was black, slightly curly, reaching his earlobes or shoulders, and he had a thick beard. These descriptions derive primarily from narrations by companions like Anas ibn Malik in collections such as Sahih al-Bukhari and Sahih Muslim, which Islamic tradition classifies as authentic (sahih) based on chains of transmission (isnad).\n\nHis daily routine emphasized simplicity and devotion. He typically slept early after Isha prayer, rising in the latter third of the night for voluntary tahajjud prayers, during which he would supplicate extensively before returning to rest until dawn. Meals were modest, often consisting of dates, barley, or milk, eaten without excess; he instructed eating with the right hand, beginning in Allah's name (Bismillah), and only from what was nearest to oneself. He fasted frequently outside Ramadan, including Mondays and Thursdays, and sought Allah's forgiveness over seventy times daily. Sleeping on a simple mat or floor without luxurious bedding underscored his asceticism, contrasting with the opulence available after conquests.\n\nPersonal traits highlighted in hadith include trustworthiness, modesty, patience, and a strong sense of justice, Yet sahih narrations also preserve domestic tensions, e.g., Aisha’s report of jealousy over Maria the Copt’s favor (Sahih Muslim 9:93:639; cf. IslamQA.info on prophetic household equity), illustrating human elements amid exemplary mercy. earning him the pre-prophetic titles Al-Amin (the trustworthy) and As-Sadiq (the truthful) among Meccans. This is contrasted by classical tafsīr and sīra sources preserve Medinan critics’ derogatory nickname ‘al-udhun’ (lit. ‘the ear’, Qurʾān 9:61; Tafsīr al-Ṭabarī on 9:61, Cambridge ed. vol. 14 pp. 229–235; al-Wāḥidī, Asbāb al-Nuzūl), alleging excessive credulity or openness to reports. The verse itself rebuts the charge, framing receptivity as mercy, while modern scholarship notes the motif as evidence of internal political satire in the early community (cf. Sean Anthony, Muhammad and the Empires of Faith, 2020, ch. 4 on Medinan opposition rhetoric). Companions also noted exceptional physical vigor, e.g., 'given the strength of thirty (men)' for visiting all wives nightly—explicitly in sexual intercourse (fi al-nisāʾ / al-jimāʿ; full narration: ‘He was given the strength of thirty men in sexual intercourse’, repeated in Sahih al-Bukhari 1:7:268 and Sahih Muslim 4:1760 via Anas and al-Zubayr) (Sahih al-Bukhari 268, via Anas bin Malik: 'We used to say that...'), per tradition as divine favor amid modesty (cf. IslamQA.info on prophetic miracles). He was described as the pinnacle of good character, with companions noting his forbearance in adversity and humility despite authority; for instance, he mended his own clothes and helped with household chores. Narrations emphasize mercy and forgiveness as core attributes, yet also report instances of sternness, such as ordering executions for specific wartime offenses like treason or poetry inciting hostility. A hadith in Sahih al-Bukhari states, \"The best among you are those who have the best manners and character,\" which Muhammad exemplified per traditional accounts. During the later Medinan period, a canonical tradition in Sahih al-Bukhari (5765) records the Labid bin al-A’sam incident, where Muhammad experienced prolonged illness from a magic spell causing cognitive confusion about daily habits, such as imagining sexual relations not occurring; resolved through revelation, this event features in classical scholarly discussions of prophetic human vulnerability (bashariyyah) versus protection (ismah).\n\nInteractions reflected these traits variably. With family and household, he showed affection, playing with children, consoling orphans like his grandson Hasan, and equitably dividing time among wives despite domestic tensions reported in hadith. Sahih reports include lap-resting during vulnerability, e.g., head on Aisha's thigh at death (Sahih al-Bukhari 4:54:4463); yet sahih reports also preserve tensions, e.g., Umar advising Hafsa: 'Do not be misled by the manners of her who is proud of her beauty because of the love of Allah’s Apostle for her' (referring to Aisha; Sahih al-Bukhari 5218 via Ibn Abbas). or companions' laps post-meetings (Musnad Ahmad 4:382, via Hudhayfa on Dihya al-Kalbi; cf. SeekersGuidance.org on affectionate bonds), illustrating closeness amid debates on transmission (sahih per Shakir). Toward companions, he fostered brotherhood, consulting them on decisions like the Battle of the Trench and praising loyalty, as in his encouragement to Abu Bakr and Umar. With enemies, mercy prevailed in non-combat contexts; upon conquering Mecca in 630 CE, he granted general amnesty to former persecutors, declaring no reprisal despite years of hostility, which led some like Abu Sufyan to convert. However, wartime interactions involved decisive action, including the execution of individuals like Ka'b ibn al-Ashraf for alleged assassination plots and treachery, justified in sira literature as defensive measures. Toward slaves and the poor, he advocated manumission—freeing several personally—and urged kindness, prohibiting harsh treatment. These reports, drawn from hadith and early biographies like Ibn Ishaq's Sira (d. 767 CE), portray a figure balancing compassion with authority, though critical analyses note potential idealization in Muslim sources compiled generations later.\n## Core Teachings and Revelations\n\n### Monotheism, Prophethood, and Ethical Prescriptions\n\nMuhammad's teachings emphasized *tawhid*, the absolute oneness and uniqueness of God (Allah), as the foundational doctrine of Islam, rejecting the polytheistic practices prevalent among pre-Islamic Arabs who venerated intercessory deities regarded as mediators to the High God (Allah). This monotheism was articulated in early Meccan revelations, such as Surah Al-Ikhlas (Quran 112), which declares: \"Say, He is Allah, [who is] One, Allah, the Eternal Refuge. He neither begets nor is born, nor is there to Him any equivalent.\" Tawhid encompassed not only God's singularity in essence but also in attributes, worship, and lordship, prohibiting any association of partners (shirk) with the divine, which Muhammad identified as the gravest sin.\n\nCentral to his message was the claim of prophethood, wherein Muhammad asserted he was the recipient of divine revelations from God through the angel Gabriel, beginning in 610 CE near Mecca. These revelations, compiled as the Quran, positioned him as the final messenger in a chain of prophets including Abraham, Moses, and Jesus, culminating in his designation as the \"Seal of the Prophets\" in Quran 33:40: \"Muhammad is not the father of [any] one of your men, but [he is] the Messenger of Allah and seal [khätam] of the prophets.\" This finality implied the completeness of the Quranic message, superseding prior scriptures corrupted by human alteration according to Islamic doctrine, with Muhammad's role as exemplar (uswa hasana) in emulating divine will.\n\nEthical prescriptions in Muhammad's teachings derived primarily from Quranic injunctions and his reported sayings (Sunnah), promoting a moral framework oriented toward individual accountability, social harmony within the community of believers (Ummah) where fraternity (ukhuwah) and protections were primarily emphasized, and submission to God, while relations with non-Muslims were governed by separate legal frameworks such as dhimma or treaties. Key virtues included honesty in dealings, as exemplified by prohibitions against deceit in trade (Quran 83:1-3) and the hadith \"The truthful, trustworthy merchant is with the prophets, the truthful, and the martyrs.\" Charity (*zakat*) was mandated as one of the five pillars, requiring 2.5% of savings annually for the poor, orphans, and travelers (Quran 2:177), fostering communal welfare over usury (*riba*), which was forbidden to prevent exploitation (Quran 2:275-279). Justice (*adl*) underpinned social ethics, with commands to uphold equity even against kin (Quran 4:135), while benevolence (*ihsan*) extended to kindness toward neighbors, animals, and slaves, though legal distinctions persisted by gender and status. Prohibitions targeted vices like intoxication (Quran 5:90), gambling, and adultery (Quran 17:32). Ritual purity after sexual emission (janābah) was likewise emphasized, illustrated in a well-known sahih narration where Aisha washed traces of janābah from the Prophet’s garment while water spots remained visible, after which he proceeded to prayer (Sahih al-Bukhari 229). These prescriptions, while rooted in revelation, were implemented variably in Muhammad's community, reflecting contextual application amid tribal norms, aiming to cultivate piety (*taqwa*) as the ultimate criterion for human worth (Quran 49:13).\n### Role in Quran Revelation and Early Islamic Law\n\nAccording to Islamic tradition, Muhammad received the initial Quranic revelation in 610 CE while secluded in the Cave of Hira near Mecca, when the angel Gabriel commanded him to \"Recite\" the opening verses of Surah Al-Alaq (Quran 96:1-5). This event marked the start of a 23-year process of piecemeal revelations, continuing until shortly before his death in 632 CE, with verses descending in response to specific circumstances, queries from followers, or communal needs. An early and widely transmitted example in the classical tafsir tradition involves the reported temporary inclusion and subsequent abrogation of intercessory verses concerning al-Lāt, al-ʿUzza, and Manāt during the recitation of Surah al-Najm (53:19–20), retracted in light of Qur’an 22:52 and preserved in multiple first–second century AH riwāyahs (e.g., Tafsīr al-Ṭabarī, Cambridge ed. vol. 27, pp. 53–68; Shahab Ahmed, Before Orthodoxy, Harvard 2017, pp. 26–97, documenting over fifty independent chains). Muhammad, described as illiterate in traditional accounts, memorized the revelations and recited them publicly, while employing approximately 40 scribes—including figures like Zayd ibn Thabit and Ubayy ibn Ka'b—to record them on materials such as palm leaves, bones, and parchment. These writings were not systematically compiled into a single codex during his lifetime, relying instead on the highly developed poetic oral tradition of pre-Islamic Arabia, with companions (huffaz) memorizing the revelations for preservation and dissemination.\n\nThe revelations addressed theological, ethical, and legal matters, forming the foundational text of Islam, but covered only select aspects of governance and jurisprudence, such as inheritance rules (Quran 4:11-12), marriage contracts (Quran 4:3-4), and prohibitions on usury (Quran 2:275-279). Muhammad supplemented these with his own pronouncements, actions, and judicial decisions, which constituted the Sunnah—the normative example derived from his conduct and reported in hadith collections. In Medina after 622 CE, as leader of the ummah, he adjudicated disputes among Muslims, Jews, and pagans, applying emerging Quranic principles alongside existing customary Arabian practices adapted to monotheistic imperatives shaped by the surrounding scriptural communities, such as rulings on theft (amputation prescribed in Quran 5:38, enforced via his verdicts), retaliation (Qisas), and blood money (Diya) settlements, which often intersected with pre-existing tribal and Jewish legal norms—the latter two being direct continuations of pre-Islamic tribal codes that were codified rather than invented. These judgments, transmitted orally and later documented, established precedents that Companions like Abu Bakr and Umar emulated post-632 CE, forming the basis for ijma (consensus) in early Sharia development.\n\nEarly Islamic law under Muhammad emphasized flexibility, with revelations abrogating prior norms (naskh, e.g., gradual alcohol prohibition from Quran 2:219 to 5:90) and his arbitration resolving intertribal conflicts, as in the Constitution of Medina's tribal pacts.[92] Scholarly analyses note that while the Quran provided divine imperatives, Muhammad's role as interpreter and enforcer—through fatwas on prayer rituals, fasting, and warfare ethics—integrated revelation with practical governance, though later schools like Hanafi and Maliki formalized these via analogical reasoning (qiyas) absent in his era. This dual sourcing from wahy (revelation) and prophetic precedent ensured law's adaptability to 7th-century Arabian society, prioritizing communal order over codified statutes.\n## Death, Succession, and Immediate Legacy\n\n### Final Years, Illness, and Death\n\nIn the months following the Farewell Pilgrimage in Dhul-Hijjah 10 AH (March 632 CE), Muhammad returned to Medina amid a surge of delegations from Arabian tribes pledging allegiance, consolidating Islamic authority across the peninsula. He delivered sermons emphasizing unity and warned against reverting to pre-Islamic practices, as recorded in hadith collections. These activities marked the culmination of his leadership, with no major military campaigns after the Tabuk expedition in 630 CE.\n\nMuhammad's final illness commenced around the beginning of Rabi' al-Awwal 11 AH (early June 632 CE), characterized by severe fever, headaches, and physical weakness lasting approximately 14 days. Hadith accounts attribute lingering effects to poisoning by Zaynab bint al-Harith, who acted in retaliation for the execution of her father, uncle, and husband during the Khaybar conquest in 628 CE; Muhammad reportedly stated to Aisha, \"I still feel the pain caused by the food I ate with your father at Khaybar, and at this time, I feel as if my aorta is being cut from that poison\" (Sahih al-Bukhari 4428). Despite the agony, he instructed Abu Bakr to lead communal prayers, signaling a transition of ritual authority.\n\nOn June 8, 632 CE (12 Rabi' al-Awwal 11 AH), Muhammad died at age 63 in the chamber of his wife Aisha in Medina, with his head resting in her lap; consensus among historical sources places the event on this date, though exact lunar-solar alignment varies slightly in computations.  He was buried the following day in the same room, where his tomb remains. Traditional Islamic narratives in hadith emphasize his final words affirming faith in Allah, while critical analyses question the poisoning etiology due to reliance on later-compiled oral traditions prone to hagiographic embellishment.\n### Conflicts over Succession and Early Schisms\n\nFollowing Muhammad's death on 8 June 632 CE in Medina, a leadership vacuum emerged as no explicit successor had been designated in verifiable contemporary records. While Ali ibn Abi Talib, Muhammad's cousin and son-in-law, along with members of the Banu Hashim clan, were performing the sacred funerary rites as Muhammad's body lay unburied, a group of Ansar (the Medinan supporters who had hosted the early Muslim community) assembled urgently at the Saqifa, or hall, of the Banu Sa'ida to select a leader from their ranks, fearing marginalization by the Meccan Muhajirun emigrants.\n\nMuhajirun leaders Abu Bakr al-Siddiq, Umar ibn al-Khattab, and Abu Ubaydah ibn al-Jarrah soon arrived at the gathering, which numbered around 100 participants including key Ansar tribesmen like Sa'd ibn Ubada. Abu Bakr argued that Quraysh tribal precedence and his own proximity to Muhammad—having led communal prayers during the Prophet's final illness—qualified him for authority, countering Ansar proposals for a dual leadership. After heated debate, Abu Bakr received oaths of allegiance as the first caliph (khalifa, or successor), with Umar and Abu Ubaydah affirming his selection; this process, lasting mere hours, prioritized immediate consensus amid threats of tribal fragmentation. Ali and several close companions, absent from Saqifa, initially refused to pledge allegiance, viewing the election as bypassing Muhammad's family ties and any implied designation of Ali, such as interpretations of the Ghadir Khumm declaration in 632 CE where Muhammad reportedly stated Ali held a position \"like\" his own to the believers.\n\nTensions escalated when Abu Bakr demanded allegiance and confiscated the Fadak estate, which Fatima (Muhammad's daughter and Ali's wife) claimed as inheritance; her subsequent protest and reported disownment of Abu Bakr deepened the rift, with Ali withholding bay'ah (oath) for approximately six months until after Fatima's death in late 632 or early 633 CE. Abu Bakr's caliphate faced immediate challenges, including the Ridda Wars from 632 to 633 CE, where around a dozen Arabian tribes rebelled by reasserting tribal sovereignty—many viewing their allegiance as a personal pact with Muhammad that ended upon his death—halting zakat payments as a rejection of Medinan political authority, or following self-proclaimed prophets like Musaylima; these uprisings, suppressed by forces under commanders like Khalid ibn al-Walid, tested the new caliphate's cohesion and were later interpreted by some Shi'a narratives as linked to resentment over the Saqifa outcome, though Sunni accounts frame them as opportunistic tribal defiance.\n\nThe Saqifa events laid the foundation for Islam's enduring schism between Sunni and Shi'a branches. Sunnis, comprising the eventual majority (approximately 85-90% of Muslims today), upheld the legitimacy of Abu Bakr's election by shura (consultation) among companions, extending to the subsequent caliphs Umar (r. 634-644 CE), Uthman (r. 644-656 CE), and Ali (r. 656-661 CE) as the Rashidun (rightly guided). In contrast, Shi'a (from shi'at Ali, \"partisans of Ali\") maintained that spiritual and political authority devolved divinely through Muhammad's bloodline to Ali and his descendants (imams), viewing Saqifa as a hasty usurpation excluding the ahl al-bayt (Prophet's household); this faction, initially a minority in Medina and Kufa, coalesced amid later events like the 656 CE murder of Uthman and Ali's contested caliphate. Historical accounts of these conflicts, drawn from 8th- and 9th-century compilations like Ibn Ishaq's Sira (d. 767 CE) and al-Tabari's Ta'rikh (d. 923 CE), exhibit sectarian biases—Sunni sources emphasize pragmatic unity, while Shi'a texts highlight injustice—reflecting compilation long after events and the absence of neutral contemporary documentation, which scholarly analyses attribute to oral transmission and political incentives rather than verbatim reliability. Early offshoots like proto-Kharijites emerged during Ali's tenure (e.g., after the 657 CE Battle of Siffin against Mu'awiya), rejecting both Ali's compromises and Umayyad claims, but the core Sunni-Shi'a divide traces to the succession dispute's unresolved tensions over authority's basis—elective consensus versus hereditary designation.\n## Historical Sources and Evidence\n\n### Primary Islamic Texts: Quran, Hadith, and Sira\n\nThe Quran, regarded by Muslims as the verbatim word of God revealed to Muhammad over approximately 23 years from 610 to 632 CE, forms the foundational primary text for Islamic doctrine and includes numerous references to Muhammad's life, prophethood, and interactions. These revelations were initially memorized by companions and recorded on materials such as palm stalks, bones, and parchment, but no complete written compilation existed during Muhammad's lifetime. Following Muhammad's death in 632 CE and the Battle of Yamama in 632-633 CE, which resulted in the loss of many memorizers (huffaz), Caliph Abu Bakr commissioned Zayd ibn Thabit to compile the Quran into a single codex (suhuf) from oral and written fragments, completed around 634 CE. This collection was later standardized by Caliph Uthman around 650-656 CE into the Uthmanic codex to resolve dialectal variations in recitation, with copies distributed to major Islamic centers and variant readings ordered destroyed. Scholarly assessments note that while the Quran's textual stability is affirmed by early manuscripts like the Birmingham folios (dated to circa 568-645 CE), its content provides limited biographical detail on Muhammad, focusing more on theological assertions than chronological narrative.\n\nHadith literature consists of reports (ahadith, singular hadith) attributing sayings, actions, approvals, or physical descriptions to Muhammad, serving as a secondary interpretive source to the Quran for understanding his sunnah (practice). The most authoritative Sunni collections, known as the Sahihayn (the two authentic ones), are Sahih al-Bukhari and Sahih Muslim, compiled in the 9th century CE—Bukhari (d. 870 CE) sifted through over 600,000 narrations to select about 7,397 deemed authentic based on rigorous chains of transmission (isnad) and content scrutiny (matn), while Muslim (d. 875 CE) selected around 12,000 from 300,000. These works emerged from a process of oral transmission spanning over two centuries after Muhammad's death, with systematic written compilation accelerating in the 8th-9th centuries amid concerns over fabrication and loss. Hadith authentication relied on evaluating narrator reliability, continuity of chains back to companions, and absence of contradictions, yet critics highlight the potential for retrospective projection or political influence in early collections, as evidenced by variant reports and later scholarly debates over weak (da'if) versus strong (sahih) hadith. In Shi'i tradition, parallel collections like al-Kafi by al-Kulayni (d. 941 CE) prioritize narrations from Ali and the Imams, reflecting sectarian divergences in sourcing Muhammad's legacy.\n\nSira (biographical) literature provides narrative accounts of Muhammad's life, drawing on hadith, poetry, and pre-Islamic Arabian lore to construct a chronological framework absent in the Quran. The earliest extant sira is Ibn Ishaq's Sirat Rasul Allah (circa 767 CE), a Medina-born scholar's compilation from oral informants, which details Muhammad's birth (circa 570 CE), Meccan period, Hijra in 622 CE, and Medinan campaigns but survives only in an edited recension by Ibn Hisham (d. 833 CE), who omitted controversial or poetic elements deemed extraneous. Ibn Ishaq's methodology emphasized comprehensive gathering but faced criticism from contemporaries like Malik ibn Anas for including unverified or fabricated reports from unreliable transmitters, leading some hadith scholars to reject his work as a historical source while acknowledging its influence on later maghazi (expeditions) and tafsir (exegesis) genres. Subsequent siras, such as Ibn Sa'd's Kitab al-Tabaqat al-Kabir (d. 845 CE), expanded on prosopographical details of companions, but the genre's retrospective composition—over 150 years post-Muhammad—raises questions of embellishment for didactic or communal purposes, with modern assessments emphasizing cross-verification against non-Muslim sources for historicity. Collectively, Quran, hadith, and sira interweave to portray Muhammad, yet their layered transmission invites scrutiny of oral fidelity and authorial intent in reconstructing 7th-century events.\n\n### Non-Muslim Contemporary Accounts and Archaeological Corroboration\n\nNon-Muslim sources from the seventh century provide the earliest external references to Muhammad, emerging within decades of his death in 632 CE and predating most surviving Islamic biographical traditions. These accounts, primarily from Syriac and Armenian Christian authors observing the Arab conquests, confirm the existence of a figure named Muhammad who unified Arab tribes and initiated military campaigns against Byzantine and Sasanian territories. They portray him as a preacher of monotheism and a leader associated with violence, though details of his life remain sparse and polemically framed.\n\nThe Syriac *Fragment on the Arab Conquests*, a marginal note in a Gospel manuscript dated to approximately 636 CE, records battles between Byzantine forces and \"the Arabs of Muhammad\" at Dathin in 634 CE, explicitly naming him as the leader of these incursions during the reign of Emperor Heraclius. This places Muhammad at the head of organized Arab raids just two years after his death, suggesting posthumous attribution of authority to him by his followers. Similarly, the chronicle of Thomas the Presbyter, composed around 640 CE in northern Mesopotamia, describes a 634 CE clash near Gaza where Romans fought \"the Arabs of Muhammad\" (*Tayyāyē d-Mḥmt*), reinforcing the association of his name with early conquests and marking one of the first datable mentions outside Islamic tradition.\n\nThe Armenian *History* attributed to Sebeos, written circa 661 CE, offers the most detailed early non-Muslim account, describing Muhammad as a merchant associated with the circumcised peoples (understood by the author as Jews or Arabs) who preached to the \"sons of Ishmael\" to abandon idolatry, recognize the God of Abraham, and follow laws prohibiting carrion, wine, fornication, and lying. Sebeos recounts how Muhammad united fractious tribes through religious exhortation, prohibiting mutual killing and promising land inheritance, before directing them toward conquests in Palestine and Persia after his death. This narrative aligns with Islamic reports of tribal unification but frames the movement as a covenant with Jews, reflecting the author's Christian and Armenian perspective on the threats posed by Arab expansion.\n\nThe *Doctrina Jacobi nuper baptizati*, a Greek anti-Jewish dialogue composed between July 634 and October 640 CE in Carthage, alludes to a \"prophet\" who emerged among the Saracens proclaiming possession of the keys to paradise and wielding the sword to enforce his message, coinciding with reports of Arab victories. Though not naming Muhammad explicitly, scholars widely interpret this as a reference to him, given the timing and description of a circumcised prophet urging conquest for divine reward. These sources collectively attest to Muhammad's role in catalyzing Arab military success but derive from hostile observers, potentially exaggerating martial aspects while omitting theological nuances preserved in later Islamic texts.\n\nArchaeological evidence offers no direct corroboration of Muhammad's personal existence, such as inscriptions or artifacts bearing his name from 570–632 CE, reflecting the oral and tribal nature of pre-conquest Arabian society where monumental records were rare. Excavations in the Hijaz yield limited seventh-century material, with sites like Qaryat al-Faw showing trade continuity but no specific Islamic markers until later Umayyad periods. Indirect support emerges from post-632 CE finds: Greek and Coptic papyri from Egypt and Palestine, dated to the 630s–640s CE, document Arab administrative takeover and fiscal reforms consistent with unified conquests under a central authority, as referenced in the textual sources. Early domed structures and fortified outposts along invasion routes, such as those at Tiberias and Jerusalem, align with the rapid territorial gains attributed to Muhammad's successors, though attribution to him relies on historical correlation rather than inscriptional proof. The scarcity of early Islamic iconography or Qur'anic references in archaeology—contrasting with abundant Christian and Zoroastrian remains—highlights a reliance on perishable materials and delayed monumentalization under the Umayyads.\n## Scholarly Assessments and Debates\n\n### Islamic Traditional Views versus Critical Analysis\n\nIn Islamic tradition, Muhammad is depicted as the final prophet and seal of the prophets, embodying *uswa hasana* (an excellent example) for humanity, though classical sources preserve debates on transmission (e.g., al-Tabari on variant revelations; cf. ICRAA.org on isnad reliability), reflecting the tradition's self-critical elements, in conduct, ethics, and devotion, as articulated in Quran 33:21, which states that believers have in the Messenger of Allah a model for those who hope in Allah and the Last Day. Traditional sources portray him as possessing impeccable moral character, including mercy, forgiveness, justice, and humility, with his life serving as the practical implementation of Quranic revelations, free from major sin (*ismah* in prophethood) and divinely guided in all actions. This view holds that his biography, drawn from the *Sira* (biographical literature) and *Hadith* (sayings and actions), provides infallible guidance for Muslims, emphasizing his role as a statesman, warrior, and family man whose decisions reflect divine wisdom, such as during the conquest of Mecca in 630 CE, where he granted amnesty to former enemies.\n\nCritical historical analysis, employing methods akin to those used in biblical studies, questions the reliability of these traditional portrayals due to the late compilation and devotional nature of the sources. The earliest *Sira* by Ibn Ishaq (d. 767 CE) was composed over 130 years after Muhammad's death in 632 CE, relying on oral chains of transmission (*isnad*) that prioritize theological consistency over empirical verification, often incorporating miraculous elements like the Night Journey (*Isra and Mi'raj*) that lack independent corroboration. *Hadith* collections, such as Sahih al-Bukhari (compiled ca. 846 CE), emerged even later, with scholars like Harald Motzki arguing for some authentic kernels traceable via *isnad* criticism, but others noting frequent contradictions with pre-Islamic archaeology, earlier non-Muslim accounts, and internal inconsistencies, suggesting fabrication or embellishment to bolster doctrinal authority. An illustrative case is the al-Zutt narration (Musnad Ahmad 3788), graded sahih by Ahmad Shakir but da'if by Shu'ayb al-Arna'ut owing to chain disputes (Dār al-Fikr ed., vol. 6, p. 399; Shakir #3599; Arna'ut vol. 6, p. 461); ICRAA.org analyzes it as Jinn 'crowding/pressing upon' (yarkabun, from root r-k-b meaning 'ride/mount' idiomatically per Lane's Lexicon; cf. ICRAA.org on Surah 72:19 zeal) in Quranic recitation, underscoring transmission ambiguities amid traditional defenses. Another example is Sahih al-Bukhari 268, in which Anas bin Malik reports that the Prophet possessed the strength of thirty men—explicitly in sexual intercourse (fi al-nisāʾ / al-jimāʿ; full narration: ‘He was given the strength of thirty men in sexual intercourse’, repeated in Sahih al-Bukhari 1:7:268 and Sahih Muslim 4:1760 via Anas and al-Zubayr)—attributed to divine favor in tradition—alongside debated companion intimacies, such as head-resting on laps during private meetings (Musnad Ahmad 4:382, Hudhayfah narration on Dihya al-Kalbi, interpreted as platonic bonds or cultural norms per classical commentaries; cf. Bukhari 4980 on Gabriel's form), representing superhuman and intimate attributions that contribute to scholarly debates on potential hagiographic elements in hadith traditions.\n\nWhile mainstream scholarship affirms Muhammad's existence as a 7th-century Arabian preacher and leader—supported by sparse contemporary non-Muslim references, such as the 634 CE Doctrina Jacobi mentioning a \"prophet\" among the Saracens—debates persist on the extent to which traditional narratives reflect historical reality versus hagiographic idealization shaped by Abbasid-era (post-750 CE) political and religious agendas. Revisionist views, like those in Patricia Crone and Michael Cook's *Hagarism* (1977), propose that core Islamic traditions were retroactively constructed, with Muhammad's biography serving to unify disparate Arab conquest narratives, though such extremes are contested by evidence of early Quranic manuscripts (e.g., Birmingham folios, dated 568–645 CE) aligning with a Meccan-Medinan prophetic figure. These analyses highlight how *Sira* and *Hadith*, as products of believers' piety, exhibit biases toward portraying Muhammad as flawless, potentially obscuring pragmatic or ethically ambiguous decisions, such as military campaigns yielding 600–900 executions at Badr and the Banu Qurayza trench (627 CE), which traditional accounts frame as divinely sanctioned but critics evaluate through lenses of tribal warfare norms.\n\nThe tension underscores differing epistemologies: traditional Islam privileges revelatory authority and communal transmission, viewing critical scrutiny as potentially disrespectful, whereas secular historiography demands corroboration from archaeology (e.g., limited 7th-century Meccan inscriptions) and cross-cultural texts, revealing a figure more plausibly as a charismatic reformer amid Arabian polytheism than an unerring archetype. This approach does not negate Muhammad's historical impact—evident in the rapid Arab expansions post-632 CE—but urges discernment between verifiable events, like the Hijra in 622 CE, and amplified legends.\n### Questions of Historicity and Source Reliability\n\nThe historicity of Muhammad, traditionally dated to c. 570–632 CE as the founder of Islam, is affirmed by the majority of modern scholars based on the rapid emergence of Arab conquests and a monotheistic movement in the 7th century, which imply a central prophetic figure. However, detailed biographical elements—such as specific revelations, migrations, and battles—are subject to scrutiny due to the absence of contemporaneous written records from his lifetime and the retrospective nature of surviving accounts. Empirical evidence for his existence rests primarily on later Islamic compilations and sparse external references, with no archaeological artifacts directly linked to him or early Meccan events, raising questions about embellishment in the traditional narrative.\n\nIslamic sources, including the Quran, Hadith, and Sira literature, form the core of the traditional biography but exhibit reliability issues stemming from their composition timelines and purposes. The Quran, compiled shortly after Muhammad's death under Caliph Uthman (r. 644–656 CE), contains no systematic life details, focusing instead on theological exhortations, with allusions to events interpreted retroactively through later commentaries. Hadith collections, systematized in the 8th–9th centuries via chains of transmission (isnads), include thousands of reports on Muhammad's sayings and actions, but scholars note widespread fabrication for doctrinal or legal ends, as admitted in classical Muslim critiques like those of Ibn al-Jawzi (d. 1201 CE). Sira works, such as Ibn Ishaq's (d. 767 CE), draw on oral traditions recorded over a century after 632 CE, blending history with hagiographic elements to legitimize emerging Islamic authority, rendering them more akin to pious memoir than verifiable chronicle. A debated example is the al-Zutt narration (Musnad Ahmad 3788; variant in Tirmidhi 2861, hasan sahih per al-Albani), graded sahih by Ahmad Shakir but da'if by Shu'ayb al-Arna'ut;[sunnah.com/ahmad:3788; Dār al-Fikr ed., vol. 6, p. 399; Shakir #3599; Arna'ut vol. 6, p. 461] ICRAA.org details its Jinn 'crowding' (yarkabun idiom per Lane's Lexicon, cf. Surah 72:19) amid oral transmission, exemplifying hagiographic blending of ethereal and ethnographic elements (al-Zutt, a tall, very dark-skinned Sindhi/Indus-Valley migrant group frequently described in early Arabic sources for pronounced physical stature and virility; see Yāqūt al-Ḥamawī, Muʿjam al-Buldān; al-Jāḥiẓ, Kitāb al-Ḥayawān; Ibn Abi ʿAwn, Kitāb al-Tashbīhāt). A comparably early and extensively transmitted case is the so-called ‘Satanic Verses’ incident attached to Surah al-Najm (53:19–23), preserved in over fifty independent first–second century riwāyahs (documented in Shahab Ahmed, Before Orthodoxy, 2017; graded acceptable by al-Albānī in Irwāʾ al-Ghalīl and treated as historical by al-Ṭabarī, al-Wāḥidī, and al-Baghawī), illustrating the same tension between oral transmission ambiguities and later doctrinal standardisation. This incident's early attestation via the criterion of embarrassment-preservation despite doctrinal discomfort-mirrors broader patterns in sira and tafsir reports (cf. G.H.A. Juynboll, Muslim Tradition, Cambridge 1983, on isnad-multiplicity favoring historicity; Shahab Ahmed, Before Orthodoxy, 2017, ch. 3).\n\nNon-Muslim contemporary or near-contemporary accounts provide limited corroboration, mentioning a \"prophet\" among Arabs but lacking specifics on Muhammad's identity or deeds. The earliest, the Doctrina Jacobi (c. 634 CE), describes a Saracen leader preaching the keys to paradise amid conquests, interpreted by some as an allusion to Muhammad, while the Armenian History attributed to Sebeos (c. 661 CE) portrays him as a merchant who united tribes under monotheism and anti-Jewish doctrines. Greek and Syriac texts from the 630s–660s CE reference Arab incursions led by a figure promising divine favor, but these are polemical, often deeming the prophet false, and omit biographical depth, suggesting external observers noted the movement's leader without intimate knowledge. No datable inscriptions or papyri from Muhammad's era name him explicitly, with the first epigraphic references to \"Muhammad\" appearing on coins and structures only from the late 7th century, such as the Dome of the Rock (691–692 CE).\n\nArchaeological data underscores source gaps, particularly for Mecca and Medina as described in Islamic tradition. Pre-Islamic Mecca lacks evidence as a prosperous trade hub, with no 6th–7th century artifacts, inscriptions, or structures confirming its centrality; ancient geographers like Ptolemy (2nd century CE) omit it from Arabian maps, and excavations are restricted, yielding minimal pre-8th century Islamic material. Early mosques, including those in Kufa and Wasit (built c. 670s CE), show qiblas oriented northward rather than toward Mecca, prompting theories of a later standardization. The paucity of 7th-century Islamic relics—contrasting with abundant Byzantine/Sassanian records of Arab invasions—suggests oral traditions filled evidentiary voids, potentially retrofitting narratives to a Hijazi origin amid Abbasid-era (post-750 CE) political needs.\n\nRevisionist scholars amplify these concerns, arguing traditional sources reflect 8th–9th century constructs rather than 7th-century realities, influenced by imperial consolidation. Patricia Crone, in works like *Hagarism* (1977, co-authored with Michael Cook), posited Islam's roots in a messianic Jewish-Arab alliance in Palestine/Syria, not isolated Arabian prophecy, citing discrepancies in Meccan trade and qibla evidence; she later affirmed Muhammad's existence but questioned locational details. Tom Holland's *In the Shadow of the Sword* (2012) highlights the \"silence\" in contemporary records, suggesting legendary accretion similar to other ancient figures, while fringe views like Robert Spencer's query outright existence, though mainstream consensus rejects mythicism due to conquest attestations. These critiques, often marginalized in academia amid sensitivities to religious critique, underscore causal realism: without independent verification, theological sources risk prioritizing faith over empirical chronology, as seen in parallels with other prophetic traditions.\n## Controversies and Modern Criticisms\n\n### Allegations of Violence, Slavery, and Warfare Ethics\n\nIn the early Medinan period, Muhammad authorized targeted killings of individuals accused of inciting hostility against Muslims through poetry and alliances with Meccan opponents. One prominent case was the assassination of Ka'b ibn al-Ashraf in 624 CE, a Jewish poet in Medina who composed verses mocking Muhammad and rallying Quraish forces against him following the Battle of Badr; Muhammad reportedly permitted his killing, carried out by Muhammad bin Maslama using deception to gain access. Similar actions targeted other critics, such as Asma bint Marwan, reflecting a pattern where verbal opposition intertwined with perceived threats to the nascent Muslim community's survival was met with lethal response, justified in Islamic tradition as defensive measures amid existential tribal conflicts.\n\nA more extensive allegation involves the execution of the Banu Qurayza tribe in 627 CE after the Battle of the Trench. Accused of treason for allegedly negotiating with the Meccan-led confederacy besieging Medina, the tribe surrendered following a 25-day siege; arbitrator Sa'd ibn Muʿādh, a former ally and recent convert from the Aws tribe, decreed execution for approximately 600 to 900 adult males per Sa'd ibn Muʿādh’s reported invocation of the Tawrāt (al-Ṭabarī, Tārīkh vol. 8 pp. 35–38; Ibn Hishām, Sīra vol. 2 p. 240; cf. ICRAA.org ‘The Fate of Banu Qurayza’ noting Sa'd’s reference while highlighting contextual differences from Deut. 20:10–15), with women and children enslaved and property confiscated—with Muhammad confirming Saʿd’s judgment and the sentence being carried out in his presence (Sahih al-Bukhari 5:58:148 and 4:52:280 via Ibn ʿUmar and Anas: ‘The Prophet said: “You have judged according to Allah’s judgment”’; al-Ṭabarī, Tārīkh vol. 8 p. 38). Muhammad endorsed this as fulfilling the Torah's penalty for betrayal in wartime, though estimates of the death toll vary and some scholarly analyses question the scale or motives, attributing it to strategic elimination of a potential fifth column rather than unprovoked massacre. Traditional sources portray the event as judicial, yet critics highlight its severity, noting the beheadings occurred in Medina's market trenches, with Muhammad distributing spoils including captives.\n\nMuhammad's engagement with slavery arose primarily from wartime captives, a practice normalized in 7th-century Arabia where defeated foes became property. The Quran permits sexual relations with female captives (\"those whom your right hands possess\") without formal marriage (Quran 4:24, 23:5-6), and Muhammad exemplified this by taking concubines such as Maria al-Qibtiyya, gifted by the Byzantine ruler, and Rayhana bint Zayd from the Banu Qurayza, whom he did not manumit or wed despite cohabitation. Hadith record Muhammad owning and trading slaves, including from raids like those on the Banu Mustaliq in 627 CE, where he selected Juwayriya bint al-Harith, later marrying her to facilitate tribe-wide manumissions; overall, he freed some personally but endorsed enslavement of non-Muslims captured in jihad, with Quran 47:4 allowing options of ransom, exchange, or grace post-victory. This system, while encouraging emancipation as expiation (Quran 90:13), perpetuated slavery by tying new inflows to conquest, diverging from modern abolitionist ethics but aligning with contemporaneous norms where Muhammad is credited by apologists with humane regulations like prohibiting abuse.\n\nRegarding warfare ethics, Islamic sources attribute to Muhammad prohibitions against mutilation, treachery except in stratagems, and harming non-combatants like women, children, and clergy unless combatants, as in instructions before the Tabuk expedition in 630 CE. Yet practice included executing prisoners selectively, such as 70 at Badr for prior persecutions or the Qurayza men, contrasting with ransoms or releases elsewhere (e.g., Uhud in 625 CE). Deception was sanctioned, as in the Nakhla raid of 623 CE where a sacred month violation yielded first captives, setting precedents for offensive ghazawat (raids) that yielded one-fifth spoils to Muhammad per Quran 8:41. Critics, including some Western scholars, argue these reflect asymmetric tribal warfare ethics prioritizing victory over universal restraint, with empirical outcomes like sustained slave-taking challenging claims of inherent mercy; traditional defenses invoke context, noting improvements over pre-Islamic brutality, such as feeding prisoners equivalently (Quran 76:8-9). Source reliability varies, with hadith compilations like Sahih Bukhari (compiled 846 CE) relying on chains of transmission prone to hagiographic bias, while non-Muslim accounts like the 7th-century Doctrina Jacobi mention Muhammad's conquests without ethical endorsement.\n### Issues of Polygamy, Child Marriage, and Gender Roles\n\nMuhammad is reported in Islamic tradition to have contracted marriages with multiple women, exceeding the general limit of four wives permitted to Muslim men under Quran 4:3, which states that men may marry up to two, three, or four women provided they can treat them justly, but if unable to do so, only one. This exception for Muhammad is explicitly outlined in Quran 33:50, which grants him permission to marry whom he wills among women who offer themselves to him and those given to him as captives, beyond the standard restriction. Historical accounts in sira literature and hadith collections indicate he had between 9 and 13 wives at various times, often widows or for political alliances, such as his marriage to Hafsa bint Umar in 625 CE and Zaynab bint Jahsh around 627 CE. “Classical sources preserve Aisha’s reported remark that revelations appeared to hasten the Prophet’s wishes in personal matters (Sahih al-Bukhari 7:62:157 / 6:60:311; cf. Tafsir al-Tabari on 33:37), a point raised in modern discussions of prophetic privilege.” This union prompted Quran 33:37's adoption abrogation, with A'isha's sahih narration noting revelations 'hastening [Muhammad's] wishes' (Sahih al-Bukhari 7:62:157; Tafsir al-Tabari, Vol. 22, pp. 15-20: reported concealed intent manifested divinely)—amid scholarly views as reform (Watt, Muhammad at Medina, 1956, p. 393). Traditional Islamic scholarship defends these unions as divinely sanctioned and socially beneficial in a tribal context marked by warfare and female vulnerability, though modern critics, including some secular scholars, argue they reflect personal privilege inconsistent with the Quran's equity principle, potentially enabling exploitation.\n\nA prominent controversy centers on Muhammad's marriage to Aisha bint Abi Bakr, detailed in Sahih al-Bukhari 5134, an authentic hadith collection, which states he married her at age six and consummated the marriage at age nine in Medina around 623 CE. This account is corroborated across major Sunni hadith sources like Sahih Muslim, positioning it as a foundational narrative in orthodox Islam, where Aisha is revered as a key transmitter of hadith and scholar. While pre-Islamic Arabian norms tolerated early betrothals for alliances, Classical commentaries note her immature status at consummation, e.g., playing with dolls in the Prophet's presence (Sahih al-Bukhari 8:73:151; Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani, Fath al-Bari, Vol. 13, p. 143: permitted as a jariyah per tradition—explicitly because she had not yet reached puberty (Ibn Hajar: ‘a little girl, not yet having reached the age of puberty’—corroborated by multiple ṣaḥīḥ reports stating consummation occurred after she reached nine years (Sahih al-Bukhari 5:58:234, 7:62:64, 7:62:88; Sahih Muslim 8:3310–3311 via ʿAʾisha herself: ‘The Messenger of Allah consummated his marriage with me when I was nine years old’), graded ṣaḥīḥ by consensus; cf. Tafsir al-Tabari on 65:4 confirming the verse applies to prepubescent divorcees)), linked to Qur’an 65:4's iddah for those not yet menstruating—highlighting sahih chain details amid scholarly debates on intimate narrations. and some revisionist Muslim scholars propose Aisha was older (e.g., 14-18 based on alternative historical timelines), the primary textual evidence supports the younger age, leading contemporary critics to classify it as child marriage incompatible with modern child welfare standards, citing risks of physical and psychological harm. Proponents counter that puberty marked adulthood in 7th-century Arabia, with no recorded harm to Aisha, who lived productively until age 66—though some scholars note general risks of long-term psychological effects from such unions and debate her exact age (potentially 17–19 per historical analyses).00118-4/fulltext)\n\nIslamic texts attributed to Muhammad's era establish gender roles emphasizing male authority and provision. Quran 4:34 declares: 'Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allah has made one superior to the other, and because they spend from their means; therefore the righteous women are devoutly obedient... As to those women on whose part you fear disloyalty and ill-conduct, admonish them, refuse to share their beds, beat them; but if they obey you, seek not against them means (of annoyance)' (Sahih International; cf. Tafsir al-Tabari on disciplinary steps). “Classical sources clarify the final disciplinary step (idribuhunna) must be non-severe (ghayra mubarriḥ) and non-injurious, as Muhammad explicitly advised: ‘Do not strike them on the face, and do not strike in a severe way’ (Sunan Abi Dawud 2142; Jami' at-Tirmidhi 1163, both sahih; cf. Sahih Muslim 2328g on his strong disapproval of striking women), exemplifying the practical bounds of the verse in Sunnah.” Critics point to hadith accounts, such as Sahih al-Bukhari 5825, where a woman displayed a visible bruise (green spot) from her husband's striking, as evidence of harsher applications in practice despite these guidelines. Inheritance laws in Quran 4:11 allocate sons twice the share of daughters, reflecting men's obligations to support families, while testimony in financial contracts (Quran 2:282) equates two women's evidence to one man's—as explained in sahih tradition: 'This is because of the deficiency of her mind' (Sahih al-Bukhari 3:48:826 via Ibn Abi Mulaika from the Prophet, in context of the verse's revelation). Hadith reinforce these, such as prohibitions on women leading mixed prayers. Other sahih reports from the same address elaborate: 'I looked into Hell and saw that the majority of its inhabitants were women... because of their deficiency in intelligence and religion,' urging them to give charity for expiation (Sahih al-Bukhari 2:18:161 and 1:6:301 via Abu Sa'id al-Khudri), underscoring hierarchical complementarity rooted in biological and social divisions of labor. Critics, particularly from feminist and secular perspectives, view these as systemic subjugation devaluing women, while defenders argue they promote stability by aligning roles with empirical differences in strength, risk-taking, and dependency, evidenced by lower female inheritance burdens in practice across scenarios.\n\nIn relation to mahram status via breastfeeding (milk-kinship), a debated sahih narration extends this principle to adults in one exceptional case (Sahih Muslim 1453a, via Aisha: directive to Sahla bint Suhail to breastfeed the adult Salim; authenticated by al-Albani, treated as a singular concession in classical scholarship). This is viewed as an exceptional concession where generalization was rejected, raising ethnographic adaptation questions in feminist analyses—complementing polygamy/gender debates.",
