# Kevin Durant

Kevin Durant (born September 29, 1988; age 37) is an American professional basketball player who stands 6 ft 11 in (2.11 m) and plays as a small forward for the Houston Rockets of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Widely regarded as one of the greatest scorers in basketball history, Durant has won two NBA championships, the 2014 NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award, two NBA Finals MVP Awards, and four Olympic gold medals, while amassing 30,882 career points with elite efficiency. His career is defined by exceptional scoring versatility, including four NBA scoring titles, and his pivotal roles in leading teams to contention across multiple franchises.

Born in Washington, D.C., Durant grew up in a single-parent household raised by his mother, Wanda Durant, and honed his skills at Montrose Christian School in Rockville, Maryland, where he averaged 23.1 points, 10.2 rebounds, and 4.7 assists per game as a senior. He committed to the University of Texas for college, playing one standout freshman season in 2006–07, during which he averaged 25.8 points and 11.1 rebounds per game, earning unanimous Associated Press Player of the Year and all major national honors before declaring for the NBA Draft. Selected second overall by the Seattle SuperSonics (who relocated to become the Oklahoma City Thunder) in the 2007 NBA Draft, Durant won Rookie of the Year honors in 2008 after averaging 20.3 points per game and quickly emerged as a franchise cornerstone.

Durant's NBA career spans 19 seasons as of 2025, beginning with nine years in Oklahoma City (2007–2016), where he led the Thunder to the 2012 NBA Finals and earned six All-NBA First Team selections, including his MVP season in 2013–14 when he averaged 32.0 points per game. He joined the Golden State Warriors in 2016, forming a dynamic partnership that resulted in NBA championships in 2017 and 2018, earning Finals MVP honors both years with averages of 35.2 and 28.8 points per game, respectively. After stints with the Brooklyn Nets (2019–2023), where he reached the 2021 Finals but was hampered by a 2019 Achilles injury, and the Phoenix Suns (2023–2025), Durant was traded to the Houston Rockets in a landmark seven-team deal on July 6, 2025, in exchange for Jalen Green, Dillon Brooks, the No. 10 pick in the 2025 draft, and multiple second-round picks; he later signed a two-year, $90 million contract extension with Houston on October 19, 2025. Through 1,135 regular-season games, Durant holds career averages of 27.2 points, 6.9 rebounds, and 4.4 assists per game, shooting 50.2% from the field, 39.0% from three-point range, and 88.2% from the free-throw line, placing him among the league's all-time elite in scoring volume and efficiency.

Internationally, Durant is the most decorated U.S. male basketball player in Olympic history, capturing gold medals with Team USA in 2012 (London), 2016 (Rio), 2020 (Tokyo), and 2024 (Paris), where he became the first American man to win four golds. He holds the all-time U.S. Olympic records for career points (518) and three-pointers (90), including a 19.5 points per game average in 2012 and a 20.7 points per game mark in Tokyo that set a single-Olympics U.S. record. Named USA Basketball Male Athlete of the Year in 2016 (co-winner) and 2021, Durant's Olympic dominance underscores his status as a global basketball icon.

## Early life

### Family background

Kevin Durant was born on September 29, 1988, in Washington, D.C., to Wanda Durant, a single mother, and Wayne Pratt, who left the family when Durant was an infant. Raised primarily by his mother in a low-income household, Durant experienced financial hardships as Wanda worked multiple jobs, including overnight shifts as a postal worker, to support her children.

Durant grew up with three siblings: an older brother, Tony Durant, who also pursued basketball and played college ball at Towson University; a sister, Brianna Pratt; and a half-brother, Rayvonne Pratt. The family relocated to Prince George's County, Maryland, where Wanda instilled values of perseverance amid economic challenges, often relying on assistance from Durant's grandmother, Barbara Davis, who played a pivotal role in his upbringing and provided emotional stability. At around age eight, Durant was introduced to basketball through local recreational programs, marking the beginning of his passion for the sport.

In 2001, when Durant was 13, his father Wayne Pratt reentered his life after years of absence, leading to a period of reconciliation and forgiveness that strengthened their bond despite the initial emotional turmoil of abandonment. This family dynamic, centered on his mother's resilience and eventual paternal involvement, profoundly shaped Durant's personal development during his early years.

### High school career

Kevin Durant began his high school basketball career at National Christian Academy in Fort Washington, Maryland, during his freshman and sophomore years (2002–2004), where he quickly emerged as a standout talent. Seeking greater competition, he transferred to the prestigious Oak Hill Academy in Mouth of Wilson, Virginia, for his junior season in 2004–05. At Oak Hill, a national powerhouse known for developing elite prospects, Durant averaged 19.6 points, 8.8 rebounds, 4.3 assists, and 2.0 blocks per game while shooting 60% from the field and 43% from three-point range, contributing to the team's strong performance.

For his senior year in 2005–06, Durant transferred again to Montrose Christian School in Rockville, Maryland, to play closer to home and under a demanding coaching staff that would further challenge his skills. At Montrose, he dominated with averages of 23.6 points, 10.2 rebounds, and 3.0 steals per game, showcasing his versatility as a 6-foot-9 forward with exceptional scoring ability from all ranges. One of his most memorable performances came in a nationally ranked matchup against his former school, Oak Hill, where he scored 31 points and grabbed 9 rebounds to lead Montrose to a 74-72 upset victory. His family provided crucial support during these transitions, with his mother Wanda Durant encouraging his pursuit of higher-level competition.

As a top national recruit ranked No. 2 in the class of 2006, Durant participated in the McDonald's All-American Game, where he earned co-MVP honors after scoring 25 points to lead the West team to victory. He was also named a first-team Parade All-American and received widespread acclaim as one of the premier high school prospects. During the recruitment process, Durant chose the University of Texas over offers from powerhouses like Kansas, North Carolina, and Kentucky, drawn by coach Rick Barnes' vision for his development.

## College career

### University of Texas

In November 2005, highly recruited prospect Kevin Durant from Montrose Christian School in Maryland signed a national letter of intent to join the University of Texas Longhorns men's basketball program under head coach Rick Barnes, drawn by the opportunity to develop in a competitive environment suited to his versatile skill set.

As a freshman forward on the 2006–07 Texas team, Durant integrated smoothly with key teammates such as fellow incoming freshman point guard D.J. Augustin, helping build team chemistry within a talented recruiting class that propelled the Longhorns to a 25–10 record and the NCAA Tournament's Sweet 16.

Durant balanced the rigors of college basketball with academics, maintaining a GPA above 3.0 to earn Big 12 Commissioner's Honor Roll recognition in both the fall 2006 and spring 2007 semesters.

On April 10, 2007, shortly after the conclusion of the season, Durant announced his decision to declare for the 2007 NBA Draft, forgoing his remaining college eligibility as a projected top selection.

### 2006–07 season

In the 2006–07 season, Kevin Durant emerged as a dominant force for the Texas Longhorns as a freshman forward, averaging 25.8 points, 11.1 rebounds, 1.3 assists, and 1.9 blocks per game across 35 appearances. His shooting efficiency included a 47.3% field goal percentage and 40.4% from three-point range, contributing to 20 double-doubles on the year, a remarkable feat for a first-year player as he became the first freshman in NCAA history to lead a major conference in both scoring and rebounding. These performances underscored Durant's versatility, blending elite scoring with rebounding prowess rarely seen from a freshman.

The Longhorns, bolstered by Durant's impact, compiled a 25–10 overall record and finished third in the Big 12 Conference with a 12–4 mark, advancing to the second round of the NCAA Tournament as a No. 4 seed. Durant's double-double averages highlighted his centrality to the team's success, as his production helped Texas reach the Big 12 Tournament championship game despite facing stiff competition.

Key highlights included a 37-point, 10-rebound effort in an overtime loss to No. 1 Kansas during the Big 12 Tournament semifinals on March 11, 2007, where Durant also recorded six blocks. Earlier, on March 3, he tallied 32 points and nine rebounds against the same opponent in a regular-season defeat. In the NCAA Tournament, Durant scored 30 points and grabbed nine rebounds in a 87–68 second-round loss to USC on March 18, 2007, marking the end of Texas's postseason run.

Durant's exceptional season earned him unanimous Big 12 Player of the Year and Freshman of the Year honors, unanimous Associated Press Player of the Year, Naismith College Player of the Year, along with NABC National Player of the Year and the Wooden Award winner as the nation's top player. These accolades cemented his status as a generational talent in just one college season.

## Professional career

### Oklahoma City Thunder (2007–2016)

Kevin Durant was selected with the second overall pick in the 2007 NBA draft by the Seattle SuperSonics. In his rookie season of 2007–08, he averaged 20.3 points per game, earning unanimous NBA Rookie of the Year honors. The franchise relocated to Oklahoma City following the 2007–08 season and rebranded as the Thunder ahead of the 2008–09 campaign.

Durant's scoring prowess quickly elevated the Thunder into contenders. He captured his first NBA scoring title in the 2009–10 season, leading the league with 30.1 points per game, and went on to win three more consecutive titles from 2010–11 through 2011–12 and again in 2013–14. During the 2012–13 season, he joined the exclusive 50–40–90 shooting club by posting 51.0% field goal shooting, 41.6% from three-point range, and 90.5% from the free-throw line while averaging 28.1 points per game.

The Thunder made the playoffs every year from 2010 through 2016, marking a period of sustained excellence. In 2011, they advanced to the Western Conference Finals but fell to the Dallas Mavericks in five games. The following year, Durant led Oklahoma City to its first NBA Finals appearance since relocating, where they lost to the Miami Heat in five games. In 2014, after reaching the Western Conference Finals again, the Thunder were defeated by the San Antonio Spurs in six games.

Central to the Thunder's core was Durant's partnership with point guard Russell Westbrook, drafted fourth overall in 2008, and shooting guard James Harden, selected third overall in 2009. This trio propelled Oklahoma City to 50-plus wins in three straight seasons from 2010–11 to 2012–13, but financial constraints led to Harden's trade to the Houston Rockets in October 2012. The 2013–14 season saw Durant claim NBA Most Valuable Player honors, averaging 32.0 points, 7.4 rebounds, and 5.5 assists per game.

Injuries disrupted the team's momentum in subsequent years. Durant suffered a Jones fracture in his right foot during the 2014 preseason, requiring surgery and causing him to miss the first 17 games; complications from the injury sidelined him for most of the season after a brief return in December. Despite the setback, the Thunder bounced back in 2015–16, finishing with 57 wins and advancing to the Western Conference Finals, where they led the Golden State Warriors 3–1 before losing the series in seven games.

Following the 2015–16 season, Durant entered free agency and signed a two-year contract with the Golden State Warriors on July 4, 2016, drawing intense backlash from Thunder fans, who burned his jerseys in public displays of discontent.

### Golden State Warriors (2016–2019)

In July 2016, Kevin Durant signed a two-year, $54.3 million contract with the Golden State Warriors, joining a roster that featured All-Stars Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green after the Thunder's loss to the Warriors in the Western Conference Finals. This move, announced via The Players' Tribune, immediately transformed the Warriors into a dominant force, with Durant's scoring versatility complementing the team's motion offense and defensive schemes led by Green.

During the 2016–17 season, Durant averaged 25.1 points, 8.3 rebounds, and 4.8 assists per game across 62 appearances, helping the Warriors achieve a league-best 67–15 regular-season record. In the playoffs, he elevated his performance, averaging 28.5 points per game, and earned Finals MVP honors after posting 35.2 points, 8.2 rebounds, and 5.4 assists per game against the Cleveland Cavaliers in a 4–1 series victory, securing the franchise's first championship since 1975. The following year, Durant re-signed on a two-year, $61.5 million deal with a player option and averaged 26.4 points, 6.8 rebounds, and 5.4 assists in 68 games, contributing to a 58–24 record. He repeated as Finals MVP in 2018, averaging 28.8 points, 10.8 rebounds, and 7.5 assists against the Cavaliers in another 4–1 win, highlighted by efficient playoff shooting of 53% from the field, 47% from three-point range, and 88% from the free-throw line across 21 games.

In the 2018–19 season, Durant maintained elite production with 26.0 points, 6.4 rebounds, and 5.9 assists per game in 78 outings, aiding a 57–25 finish and the top Western Conference seed. However, his tenure ended amid injury setbacks during the playoffs: a right calf strain sidelined him from late May onward, and he returned prematurely for Game 5 of the NBA Finals against the Toronto Raptors in June, scoring 11 points in 12 minutes before rupturing his Achilles tendon, which forced his free agency opt-out shortly after.

Durant's arrival drew widespread criticism for forming a "superteam," exacerbating the Warriors' dominance after their record 73-win 2015–16 season and casting him as a league villain despite the back-to-back titles that solidified a dynasty. The Warriors' 207 combined regular-season wins from 2016 to 2019 underscored this era's unparalleled success, though internal tensions from his Thunder exit lingered briefly.

### Brooklyn Nets (2019–2023)

On July 7, 2019, Kevin Durant signed a four-year, $164 million contract with the Brooklyn Nets via a sign-and-trade deal with the Golden State Warriors, joining Kyrie Irving to form the core of a potential superteam. However, Durant ruptured his right Achilles tendon in Game 5 of the 2019 NBA Finals while with the Warriors, sidelining him for the entire 2019–20 season as he underwent rehabilitation. The Nets finished 35–39 that year, missing the playoffs despite adding players like Spencer Dinwiddie and Jarrett Allen to bolster the roster around Irving.

Durant made his Nets debut on December 13, 2020, after 552 days of recovery, and in the 2020–21 season, he appeared in 35 games, averaging 26.9 points, 7.1 rebounds, and 5.6 assists per game while shooting 53.7% from the field. The Nets acquired James Harden in a blockbuster four-team trade on January 14, 2021, assembling a star trio that propelled them to a 48–24 record and the No. 2 seed in the Eastern Conference. In the playoffs, Brooklyn defeated the Boston Celtics 4–1 in the first round, with Durant averaging 31.7 points per game, before losing to the Milwaukee Bucks 4–3 in the Eastern Conference semifinals, where he posted 35.4 points, 10.6 rebounds, and 5.4 assists per game despite the team's injury-riddled series.

The 2021–22 season brought further challenges, as Irving's refusal to get vaccinated against COVID-19 violated New York City's mandate, barring him from all 41 home games and limiting him to 29 appearances overall. Harden, frustrated with the situation, requested and was granted a trade to the Philadelphia 76ers on February 10, 2022, in exchange for Ben Simmons and others. Durant played 55 games, averaging 29.9 points, 7.4 rebounds, and 5.8 assists per game on 58.0% shooting, but the Nets limped to a 44–38 record as the No. 7 seed and were swept 0–4 by the Celtics in the first round, with Durant averaging 26.3 points per game.

In 2022–23, Irving's indefinite suspension in November 2022 for promoting an antisemitic film on social media further disrupted team chemistry. Durant played 47 games, averaging 26.0 points, 6.0 rebounds, and 5.1 assists per game, before suffering a sprained MCL in his right knee on January 8, 2023, against the Miami Heat, which sidelined him for the remainder of the season. The Nets finished 45–37 and lost in the first round to the Philadelphia 76ers 4–0 without their star duo intact. Amid ongoing dysfunction, including Irving's trade request and the failed superteam vision, Durant requested a trade on February 5, 2023, citing a desire for a new direction, leading to his departure from Brooklyn.

### Phoenix Suns (2023–2025)

On February 9, 2023, the Phoenix Suns acquired Kevin Durant from the Brooklyn Nets in a blockbuster trade, sending Mikal Bridges, Cam Johnson, Jae Crowder, four unprotected first-round picks (2023, 2025, 2027, 2029), and a 2028 pick swap in return, along with T.J. Warren joining Durant in Phoenix. The move paired Durant with All-Stars Devin Booker and Chris Paul, forming a veteran-led "Big Three" aimed at immediate contention in the Western Conference.

Durant debuted for the Suns on March 17, 2023, and played eight regular-season games, averaging 26.0 points, 6.0 rebounds, and 5.1 assists per game while shooting 58.5% from the field and 42.9% from three-point range. In the 2023 playoffs, Phoenix advanced past the Los Angeles Clippers in the first round before falling to the Denver Nuggets in the Western Conference semifinals in six games, with Durant averaging 29.3 points, 9.7 rebounds, and 5.0 assists per game in the series despite the 2-4 defeat. The loss highlighted early integration challenges for the high-powered Suns lineup, which finished the regular season with a 51-31 record but struggled against Denver's balanced attack led by Nikola Jokić.

In the 2023–24 season, Durant established himself as the Suns' scoring focal point, averaging 27.1 points, 6.6 rebounds, and 5.0 assists across 75 games while earning All-NBA Second Team honors for the third time in his career. On March 21, 2024, he surpassed Shaquille O'Neal's 28,596 points to enter the NBA's top eight all-time scorers, reaching 28,598 points on a midrange jumper against the Philadelphia 76ers. However, the Suns' postseason run ended abruptly in the first round with a 4-0 sweep by the Minnesota Timberwolves, as Durant's 26.7 points per game could not overcome team-wide offensive stagnation and defensive lapses.

Durant's 2024–25 campaign peaked in individual milestones amid mounting team frustrations, as he became the eighth player in NBA history to reach 30,000 career points on February 12, 2025, with a free throw against the Memphis Grizzlies. He averaged 26.6 points, 6.0 rebounds, and 4.2 assists in 62 games, shooting 52.7% from the field, 43.0% from three, and 91.0% from the free-throw line—his most efficient full season since 2013. Despite these efficiencies, Phoenix compiled a disappointing 36-46 record, missing the playoffs for the first time since 2020 due to chemistry issues, inconsistent rotations under coach Mike Budenholzer, and injuries to key role players.

On July 6, 2025, the Suns traded Durant to the Houston Rockets as part of a record seven-team deal, receiving young guard Jalen Green, forward Dillon Brooks, the No. 10 pick in the 2025 NBA Draft, and additional draft assets in exchange, signaling a shift toward roster retooling after failing to meet championship expectations.

### Houston Rockets (2025–present)

On July 6, 2025, Kevin Durant was traded from the Phoenix Suns to the Houston Rockets in a historic seven-team deal, in exchange for Jalen Green, Dillon Brooks, the No. 10 pick in the 2025 NBA Draft, and several second-round picks along with expiring contracts. The move came after the Suns finished the 2024–25 season with a 36–46 record, missing the playoffs for the first time since 2020. Shortly after, on October 19, 2025, Durant agreed to a two-year, $90 million contract extension with the Rockets, including a player option for the 2027–28 season.

In his new role with Houston, Durant has served as a mentor to the team's young core, particularly forward Jabari Smith Jr. and center Alperen Şengün, providing guidance on footwork, shot creation, and professional habits during offseason sessions and early practices. As of November 2025, Durant has averaged 25.9 points, 4.7 rebounds, and 3.4 assists per game while shooting 51.0% from the field, contributing to the Rockets' strong start to the season.

The Rockets, who posted a 52–30 record in 2024–25 to secure the No. 2 seed in the Western Conference before a first-round playoff exit, are leveraging Durant's veteran leadership in coach Ime Udoka's offense-heavy system to push for a deeper postseason run. During the offseason, Durant emphasized training for durability to address past injury concerns that limited him to 62 games the prior season. Off the court, he has engaged with the Houston community, teaming up with local rapper Bun B in August 2025 to support flood relief efforts in Texas Hill Country following severe July storms.

## International career

### FIBA World Championships

Kevin Durant represented the United States at the 2010 FIBA World Championship in Turkey, where he emerged as a pivotal figure in securing the gold medal—the first for Team USA since 1994. At just 21 years old, Durant started all nine games, averaging 22.8 points per game to rank third in tournament scoring, while contributing 6.1 rebounds and 1.8 assists per game. His efficiency was notable, shooting 56.0% from the field, 41.7% from three-point range, and 88.9% from the free-throw line, helping the undefeated American squad dominate with an average margin of victory exceeding 30 points.

Durant's impact peaked during the knockout stages, showcasing his scoring prowess under pressure. In the quarterfinal against Russia, he tallied 33 points; in the semifinal versus Lithuania, he erupted for a U.S. single-game record of 38 points on 14-of-25 shooting, including five three-pointers, propelling Team USA to an 89-74 victory. In the final against host nation Turkey, Durant added 28 points, including seven three-pointers, to lead a 81-64 win and claim tournament MVP honors as the youngest recipient in FIBA World Championship history. His leadership and versatility as a small forward were instrumental in restoring USA Basketball's supremacy on the international stage.

Following the 2010 triumph, Durant did not participate in subsequent FIBA World Championships, including the 2014 edition in Spain from which he withdrew due to physical and mental fatigue ahead of the NBA season, as well as the 2019 and 2023 tournaments amid a strategic emphasis on Olympic cycles and demanding professional schedules. This shift allowed him to prioritize Olympic appearances, where he continued to excel for Team USA.

### Olympic Games

Kevin Durant has been a cornerstone of the United States men's national basketball team in the Olympics, contributing to four gold medals and establishing himself as the all-time leading scorer for Team USA in Olympic competition with 518 points across 28 games. His scoring prowess and clutch performances have been instrumental in maintaining USA Basketball's dominance, particularly in high-stakes matchups against international rivals like Spain and France.

In the 2012 London Olympics, Durant started all eight games for the undefeated U.S. team, averaging a team-high 19.5 points per game while adding 5.8 rebounds and 2.6 assists. He tallied 156 points overall, setting a U.S. Olympic single-tournament record at the time, and capped the gold medal run with 30 points in the final against Spain, tying for the third-highest single-game scoring total in U.S. Olympic history. This performance helped secure an 107-100 victory, defending the Americans' title from Beijing.

Durant continued his excellence at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics, leading the U.S. in scoring with 19.4 points per game over eight contests, alongside 5.0 rebounds and 3.5 assists. Overall, he shot 57.8% from the field and 58.1% from three-point range. In the medal rounds, he averaged 23.7 points per game. His tournament highlight came in the gold medal game against Serbia, where he scored 30 points to secure a 96-66 win and the Americans' third consecutive Olympic title.

At the 2020 Tokyo Olympics—delayed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic—Durant averaged 20.7 points per game in six appearances, ranking second on the team and marking the highest U.S. Olympic scoring average in his career to that point. Despite the disruptions, he delivered pivotal scoring bursts, including 29 points in the quarterfinal victory over Spain and another 29 in the gold medal game against France, helping the U.S. overcome an early tournament loss to claim their fourth straight gold with an 87-82 final win.

Durant returned for the 2024 Paris Olympics, where he averaged 13.8 points, 3.2 rebounds, and 2.3 assists in six games, often coming off the bench due to an injury recovery. During the tournament, he surpassed Lisa Leslie to become Team USA's all-time Olympic scoring leader with a basket against Brazil in the quarterfinals, finishing with 15 points in the gold medal game victory over France. This achievement solidified his legacy as the first male basketball player to win four Olympic golds, underscoring his enduring impact on USA Basketball's international success.

## Playing style

### Offensive prowess

Kevin Durant has established himself as one of the NBA's most versatile and efficient scorers, leveraging his 6-foot-11 frame and smooth shooting mechanics to dominate from multiple ranges. His mastery of mid-range shooting stands out as a signature element of his offensive arsenal, where he has consistently shot over 50% in several seasons, including a league-leading 57.1% during the 2022-23 campaign. This efficiency is particularly evident in his pull-up jumper, a move that combines his quick release and length to create separation against defenders, allowing him to score effectively off the dribble in isolation situations.

Durant's development as a three-point shooter further underscores his offensive evolution, improving from a rookie-season mark of 28.8% in 2007-08 to a career 38.7%. This progression reflects his adaptation to the modern NBA's emphasis on perimeter shooting, culminating in two 50-40-90 shooting seasons—achieved in 2012-13 (51.0% FG, 41.6% 3P, 90.5% FT) and 2022-23 (56.0% FG, 40.4% 3P, 91.9% FT)—joining an elite group of players who have met these benchmarks for field goals, three-pointers, and free throws in a single season.

His scoring prowess is quantified by four NBA scoring titles (2010, 2011, 2012, 2014) and surpassing 30,000 career points, a milestone reached in February 2025, placing him among the league's all-time greats in offensive output. Durant's height advantage enables him to excel in isolation plays, where he generates points through his ability to rise over contests or utilize his handle for drives. In the playoffs, this elevates further, with a career 1.28 points per possession in isolation possessions, demonstrating his capacity to deliver in high-stakes scenarios. When faced with double-teams, Durant counters by distributing, averaging 4.4 assists per game over his career to keep defenses honest.

### Defensive role

Kevin Durant's defensive contributions have been marked by his exceptional length and versatility, allowing him to disrupt plays across multiple positions. With a 7-foot-5 wingspan, he has effectively guarded players from point guards to power forwards throughout his career, leveraging his quickness and reach to contest shots on the perimeter. His career average of 1.0 steals per game underscores his ability to generate turnovers, often by poking at the ball during drives or passing lanes.

At the rim, Durant's 1.1 blocks per game highlight his shot-altering presence, particularly against taller opponents where his elevation and timing allow him to reject attempts from above. During his time with the Golden State Warriors, he excelled in weak-side help defense, rotating to contest drives and protecting the basket as the last line of defense, which contributed to opponents shooting just 36.4% at the rim in key playoff matchups. This rim protection was especially vital in high-stakes games, where his positioning forced misses even when isolated on weaker defenders.

Durant's rebounding prowess adds another dimension to his defensive impact, with a career average of 7.0 rebounds per game that ranks as elite for a forward of his archetype. In Oklahoma City, he peaked at 8.0 rebounds per game during the 2011-12 season, including strong offensive board work of 0.7 per game in 2010-11, where he capitalized on his positioning to secure second-chance opportunities.

Despite these strengths, Durant's slender 240-pound frame has presented limitations, particularly in navigating screens and handling physical post-ups, where he concedes higher points per possession. In later years, occasional lapses in defensive effort have drawn criticism, especially as his offensive responsibilities sometimes reduced his intensity on that end. Post-2019 Achilles injury, his mobility has been impacted, affecting his lateral quickness and overall defensive endurance. In the 2024-25 season with the Suns and early 2025-26 with the Rockets, Durant has maintained versatile defense while focusing more on help rotations due to reduced burst speed.

## Off the court

### Personal life

Kevin Durant was born on September 29, 1988, in Washington, D.C., to Wanda Durant and Wayne Pratt. His parents separated when he was an infant, and he was primarily raised by his mother, Wanda, alongside his older brother Tony in Prince George's County, Maryland. Durant also has two half-siblings, Brianna and Rayvonne, from his father's side, and he maintains close ties with his family, often crediting Wanda's sacrifices for his success while keeping their personal lives out of the public eye. He has no children as of 2025.

In his romantic life, Durant has largely maintained privacy, with his most notable relationship being his engagement to WNBA player Monica Wright. The couple met in 2006 at the McDonald's All-American Game and began dating around 2011–2012; Durant proposed in 2013, but they ended the engagement in 2014. Since then, Durant has been linked to several women through rumors, including model Raven Trujillo in the early 2010s, but he has not confirmed any long-term partnerships and has expressed reluctance toward marriage, citing a preference for independence.

Durant's residences have followed his NBA career moves. He lived in Oklahoma City from 2007 to 2016 during his tenure with the Thunder, then relocated to the San Francisco Bay Area from 2016 to 2019 while playing for the Warriors. From 2019 to 2023, he resided in Brooklyn with the Nets, followed by Phoenix from 2023 to 2025 with the Suns, and he now lives in Houston after joining the Rockets in 2025.

Outside of basketball, Durant enjoys gaming and serves as a long-term partner with NBA 2K, collaborating on game development and appearing as a cover athlete for NBA 2K Mobile. He is an avid reader of articles and news, which helps him stay informed and reflective. Additionally, he has developed an interest in film production through his company Thirty Five Ventures, producing acclaimed shorts like the Oscar-winning *Two Distant Strangers* in 2021. On social media, he maintains an active Instagram presence under @easymoneysniper, with over 14 million followers as of November 2025, where he shares glimpses of his life and interests.

Durant values his privacy, particularly regarding family matters, and has avoided exposing them to media scrutiny. In 2017, he faced a public scandal when he accidentally revealed a burner Twitter account (@KDTrey5) used to defend himself online against critics following his move to the Warriors, leading to widespread memes and discussions about his social media habits. Despite this, he continues to use anonymous accounts occasionally but emphasizes protecting his inner circle. His philanthropic efforts, such as through the Kevin Durant Charity Foundation, occasionally tie back to supporting his family's community roots in D.C.

### Philanthropy and business

Durant established the Durant Family Foundation (DFF) in 2013 to enrich the lives of at-risk youth from low-income backgrounds through educational, athletic, and social programs. The foundation's initiatives often emphasize support for education and families facing challenges similar to those Durant experienced growing up in a single-parent household. Through its BUILD IT AND THEY WILL BALL program, DFF has renovated and built basketball courts in underprivileged communities, including multiple facilities in the Washington, D.C., area such as those at Potomac Gardens and Benning Terrace in 2018.

In 2021, DFF committed $10 million over 10 years to College Track, an organization aiding low-income students in achieving college completion, to establish the Durant Center in Prince George's County, Maryland—Durant's hometown. The donation supports after-school programming for underserved high school students, focusing on academic preparation, mentorship, and college access. Durant has also engaged in activism, notably supporting the Black Lives Matter movement in 2020 by partnering with Degree to donate $1 million to 10 social justice organizations addressing racial equity and youth development. In August 2025, DFF partnered with rapper Bun B to support victims of the Hill Country Floods and donated $500,000 to Bowie State University for renovations to its basketball arena.

On the business front, Durant co-founded Boardroom in 2020 with business partner Rich Kleiman, a media platform exploring the intersections of sports, entertainment, and culture through podcasts, articles, and events. Through his investment firm Thirty Five Ventures (35V), established in 2017, he has backed numerous tech startups, including early investments in Coinbase and Postmates, as well as ventures in health tech like Whoop. In 2025, 35V invested in sparkling water company Spindrift in July, a minority stake in Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) through a partnership with Qatar Sports Investments in June, and a strategic investment in youth basketball operator MADE Hoops in November. Durant has also invested in esports, acquiring stakes in organizations such as Andbox in 2021, which fields teams in the Overwatch League (NYXL) and Call of Duty League.

Durant's endorsement portfolio includes a landmark partnership with Nike since his 2007 rookie season, initially a seven-year, $60 million deal that has extended into a lifetime agreement in 2023, reportedly worth over $300 million cumulatively including royalties. He signed with Jay-Z's Roc Nation Sports in 2013 for representation and branding, leading to collaborations in music and entertainment. Additionally, his ongoing partnership with Degree since around 2020 has supported philanthropic efforts, including joint donations for youth sports and social causes.

### NBA playoffs

Kevin Durant has established himself as one of the most prolific scorers in NBA playoff history, accumulating 5,028 points over 171 games for a career average of 29.4 points per game, the highest among active players. His postseason rebounding average stands at 7.9 per game, with 4.3 assists, underscoring his all-around impact in high-stakes environments. These totals reflect his consistency across 13 playoff appearances, where he has navigated intense defensive schemes while maintaining elite scoring volume.

Durant's playoff narrative includes pivotal series that highlight his performance under pressure. In the 2012 NBA Finals with the Oklahoma City Thunder, he averaged 30.6 points, 6.0 rebounds, and 2.2 assists across five games, but the team fell to the Miami Heat in five. He elevated his game in the 2017 NBA Finals after joining the Golden State Warriors, posting 35.2 points, 8.2 rebounds, and 5.4 assists in five games to secure a championship and Finals MVP honors in a 4-1 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers. Durant repeated as Finals MVP in 2018, averaging 28.8 points, 10.8 rebounds, and 7.5 assists in a four-game sweep of the Cavaliers. Later, in the 2021 Eastern Conference Semifinals with the Brooklyn Nets, he delivered 35.4 points, 10.6 rebounds, and 5.4 assists over seven games against the Milwaukee Bucks, though the Nets lost the series 4-3.

Advanced metrics further illustrate Durant's playoff efficiency, with a career points per possession (PPP) of 1.15, demonstrating his effectiveness in generating scoring opportunities. However, his efficiency has occasionally dipped in series losses, as seen in the 2023 playoffs with the Phoenix Suns, where he averaged 29.0 points, 8.7 rebounds, and 5.5 assists over 12 games amid a first-round win over the Los Angeles Clippers and a second-round defeat to the Denver Nuggets.
