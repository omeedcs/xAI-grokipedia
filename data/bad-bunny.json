  "content": "# Bad Bunny\n\nBenito Antonio Martínez Ocasio (born March 10, 1994), known professionally as Bad Bunny, is a Puerto Rican rapper, singer, and songwriter prominent in reggaeton and Latin trap genres.\nEmerging in the mid-2010s through social media videos, he achieved international breakthrough with his 2018 debut album *X 100pre*, blending trap beats with introspective lyrics sung exclusively in Spanish.\nBad Bunny set streaming records as the first non-English-language artist to become Spotify's most-streamed globally in 2022, accumulating over 18.5 billion streams that year.\nHis catalog has surpassed 100 million equivalent album sales, driven by hits from albums like *Un Verano Sin Ti* and recent releases such as *Debí Tirar Más Fotos*.\nAmong his accolades are three Grammy Awards for Best Música Urbana Album and 11 wins at the 2025 Billboard Latin Music Awards, including Artist of the Year.\nBad Bunny's career features eclectic genre fusions, distinctive vocal style, and public stances on Puerto Rican political issues, including critiques of U.S. territorial policies, which have sparked backlash amid his selection for the 2026 Super Bowl halftime show.\n\n## Early life\n\n### Childhood in Vega Baja\n\nBenito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, known professionally as Bad Bunny, was born on March 10, 1994, in the Almirante Sur barrio of Vega Baja, Puerto Rico, approximately 30 miles west of San Juan. He was raised in a lower middle-class household by his father, Tito Martínez, a truck driver, and his mother, Lysaurie Ocasio, an English schoolteacher. The family included two younger brothers, Bernie and Bysael Martínez Ocasio, with Benito as the eldest.\n\nMartínez Ocasio grew up in a Catholic household influenced by his mother's strong religious devotion, which involved regular church attendance and participation in the local church choir until age 13. Music permeated family life, with exposure to salsa and merengue from his father's preferences, alongside pop and ballads favored by his mother, including artists like El Gran Combo, Héctor Lavoe, and Juan Gabriel.\n\nAs a child, he developed interests in reggaeton pioneers such as Vico C, Tego Calderón, and Daddy Yankee, which sparked his early songwriting around age 13. These influences, combined with Puerto Rico's ongoing economic pressures—including a recession that began in the mid-2000s—contributed to a environment of resourcefulness in his formative years in rural Vega Baja.\n\n### Education and initial interests\n\nBenito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, known professionally as Bad Bunny, attended local schools in Vega Baja, Puerto Rico, during his childhood, where he developed an early interest in music through participation in his local Catholic church choir until his early teenage years. Influenced by his devout Catholic mother, this involvement honed his vocal abilities without formal training, exposing him to structured singing in a religious context.\n\nIn his teens, Martínez transitioned from choir participation to self-taught freestyling and beat-making, often practicing alone in his room while drawing inspiration from reggaeton artists like Daddy Yankee and Vico C, as well as genres such as salsa, merengue, and rock. These pursuits reflected his rejection of traditional religious musical outlets in favor of urban genres, prioritizing personal experimentation over institutional guidance in Puerto Rico's economically constrained environment.\n\nFollowing high school, he enrolled in the audiovisual communications program at the University of Puerto Rico at Arecibo around 2013, aiming for a conventional career path amid limited local opportunities. However, after a brief period—approximately one semester—he dropped out in 2014 to dedicate himself fully to music production and performance, forgoing degree completion despite familial concerns, as he later recounted convincing his mother of his commitment despite the risks. This decision underscored his resourcefulness, leveraging self-acquired skills in beat creation to bypass formal education and industry barriers.\n\n## Musical beginnings\n\n### 2013–2016: Independent releases and SoundCloud era\n\nIn 2013, Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, then a teenager working part-time as a supermarket bagger in Vega Baja, Puerto Rico, created a SoundCloud account and began uploading original tracks under the stage name Bad Bunny. The pseudonym originated from a childhood photograph capturing him at around age six, dressed unwillingly in a bunny costume for an Easter event and displaying a visibly angry expression, which family and friends teasingly labeled \"el conejo malo.\" These initial releases emphasized a raw, self-taught production style, with Martínez experimenting on home computers using accessible digital audio workstations, blending traditional reggaeton beats with nascent trap influences amid Puerto Rico's protracted economic downturn, which featured youth unemployment rates exceeding 25% by 2013.\n\nEarly visibility remained confined to local online circles, achieved primarily through freestyle rap videos posted on Facebook and YouTube, where Martínez demonstrated improvisational skills over popular instrumentals without professional backing or promotion. This grassroots approach aligned with a broader DIY ethos among Puerto Rican urban youth navigating fiscal austerity and limited access to recording studios, fostering a scene reliant on free platforms for distribution rather than established industry channels. Tracks from this period, such as informal freestyles and demos, circulated modestly within island-based social networks, accruing hundreds rather than thousands of plays initially.\n\nThe turning point arrived in 2016 with the self-produced single \"Diles,\" uploaded to SoundCloud on January 25, which marked Bad Bunny's first notable viral success through organic shares in Puerto Rico's trap and reggaeton communities. Featuring explicit lyrics on fleeting relationships over a minimalist trap-reggaeton hybrid beat, the track resonated with local listeners for its unpolished authenticity, eventually surpassing 1 million streams on the platform by mid-year while Martínez remained unsigned and self-managed. Despite this breakthrough, commercial infrastructure eluded him, as \"Diles\" spread via peer-to-peer digital sharing without radio play or label investment, underscoring the era's independence from mainstream gatekeepers.\n\n### 2016–2017: Mixtapes and first collaborations\n\nIn 2016, Bad Bunny released the track \"Diles\", featuring Ozuna, Farruko, Arcángel, and Ñengo Flow, which gained traction on SoundCloud and attracted the attention of DJ Luian. This led to his signing with Hear This Music, DJ Luian's independent label, marking a shift from independent uploads to structured label support while he continued working a day job.\n\nDuring this period, Bad Bunny built underground credibility through collaborations with established Puerto Rican trap and reggaeton artists, including Arcángel on tracks like \"Tu No Vive Así\" and \"Me Acostumbré\", the latter released in February 2017 under Pina Records. These features integrated him into the local scene, fostering organic networking without major promotional pushes.\n\nHis early output fused trap's raw, melodic flows with reggaeton rhythms, often exploring themes of street life, personal hardships, and relational tensions, which resonated in Puerto Rico's underground circuits and hinted at broader potential amid the rising Latin trap wave. This phase emphasized grassroots momentum through SoundCloud shares and local remixes rather than mainstream exposure.\n\n## Rise to prominence\n\n### 2018: Breakthrough singles and YHLQMDLG precursors\n\nIn 2018, Bad Bunny achieved significant crossover exposure through high-profile collaborations that introduced his trap-reggaeton fusion to broader U.S. and international audiences. His feature on Cardi B's \"I Like It,\" alongside J Balvin, was released on May 25 as part of her debut album *Invasion of Privacy*, marking a pivotal track that blended Latin rhythms with hip-hop and topped charts in multiple countries due to its viral appeal on platforms like YouTube and Spotify. The song's live debut at Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival on April 22, during Cardi B's set in Weekend 2, showcased Bad Bunny's energetic stage presence to a massive festival crowd, amplifying his visibility beyond Latin markets. Later that year, his collaboration with Drake on \"MIA,\" released October 11, further propelled his profile; the track's romantic trap sound and Drake's global draw generated millions of streams, highlighting Bad Bunny's ability to merge Puerto Rican urban styles with mainstream pop sensibilities.\n\nAmid these breakthroughs, Bad Bunny released standalone singles that foreshadowed the eclectic, genre-blending approach of his later project *YHLQMDLG*. \"Estamos Bien,\" dropped on June 28, served as an anthem for Puerto Rican resilience post-Hurricane Maria, which struck in September 2017; the track juxtaposed upbeat perreo rhythms with lyrics addressing recovery struggles and government neglect, including a pointed critique of then-President Trump's response. Its music video, filmed in Puerto Rico, captured everyday scenes of community rebuilding, resonating virally on social media where fans shared it as a symbol of defiance rather than polished escapism. Bad Bunny performed it on *The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon* on September 26, dedicating it explicitly to Maria's victims and noting over 3,000 deaths, which broadened his narrative beyond party anthems to socially conscious commentary.\n\nThese releases built momentum toward *YHLQMDLG* through Bad Bunny's grassroots tactics, emphasizing raw freestyles and direct digital engagement over traditional label promotion. He frequently shared unpolished freestyles and song snippets on Instagram and Twitter, fostering organic hype by interacting with fans and adapting to viral trends, such as remixing popular beats in real-time. This authenticity-driven strategy, rooted in Puerto Rico's urban music scene, contrasted with mainstream marketing and cultivated a loyal following that anticipated his experimental pivot in subsequent work, evident in the improvisational energy of tracks like \"Estamos Bien.\"\n\n### 2019: X 100pre and collaborations with major artists\n\nBad Bunny's debut studio album *X 100pre*, released independently on December 24, 2018, via Rimas Entertainment, garnered substantial acclaim in 2019, culminating in a win for Best Urban Music Album at the Latin Grammy Awards on November 14. The project included guest appearances from artists such as Drake on \"MIA,\" Diplo on \"200 MPH,\" and El Alfa, blending trap, reggaeton, and Latin influences to establish his versatile sound. This recognition marked a pivotal validation of his independent approach amid rising commercial pressures.\n\nSupporting the album's momentum, Bad Bunny launched the *X 100pre Tour* on March 8, 2019, in San Juan, Puerto Rico, extending across North America, Latin America, and Europe before concluding on December 8 in Tampa, Florida. The 53-date trek sold 664,747 tickets, generating $55.1 million in revenue and demonstrating his burgeoning live draw beyond streaming dominance.\n\nThroughout 2019, strategic partnerships with established reggaeton figures amplified Bad Bunny's crossover appeal, including features on J Balvin's album *Oasis* such as \"Qué Pretendes\" alongside Jhay Cortez, which contributed to the project's chart-topping success. Collaborations like \"Una Locura\" with Ozuna, J Balvin, and Chencho Corleone further solidified his position, with the track reaching number one on the Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart. These alliances, paired with profiles in outlets like GQ highlighting his barrier-blurring persona, underscored a transition from Puerto Rican underground roots to international prominence.\n\n## Mainstream success\n\n### 2020: YHLQMDLG, Las que no iban a salir, and El Último Tour del Mundo\n\nIn 2020, Bad Bunny released three albums amid the COVID-19 pandemic, leveraging streaming platforms for unprecedented dominance. His second studio album, *YHLQMDLG* (an acronym for *Yo Hago Lo Que Me Da La Gana*, translating to \"I Do What I Want\"), dropped on February 29, generating 179,000 equivalent album units in its debut week and peaking at No. 2 on the Billboard 200, the highest position then achieved by a Spanish-language album. The project emphasized themes of youthful rebellion and personal autonomy, featuring collaborations such as Daddy Yankee on \"La Santa\" and production blending reggaeton with trap and rock elements.\n\nOn May 10, Bad Bunny surprise-dropped the compilation *Las Que No Iban a Salir* (\"The Ones That Were Not Meant to Come Out\"), a 10-track release without prior announcement that saw all songs debut simultaneously on the Hot Latin Songs chart. This unheralded project continued his experimental streak, incorporating leftover tracks and freestyles that highlighted introspective and raw lyrical content amid lockdown isolation.\n\nCapping the year, *El Último Tour del Mundo* arrived on November 27, debuting at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 with entirely Spanish-language tracks, marking the first such album to top the chart in its 64-year history. Shifting toward more contemplative themes of existential reflection and relationships, it included guest spots like Residente on \"Bellacoso\" remixes tied to the era's output, though primarily self-produced.\n\nThese releases shattered streaming benchmarks during the pandemic, with *YHLQMDLG* amassing over 3.3 billion Spotify streams to become the platform's most-streamed album of 2020, propelling Bad Bunny to the top global artist with 8.3 billion total streams. Virtual adaptations sustained engagement, exemplified by his September 20 mobile concert on a flatbed truck through New York City streets, drawing over 10 million live viewers while adhering to restrictions. This approach underscored a pivot to digital innovation, bypassing canceled live tours and amplifying his quarantine-era cultural impact.\n\n### 2021: Continued chart dominance and global tours\n\nIn 2021, Bad Bunny sustained his chart dominance through lingering success from prior releases, including the track \"HAWÁI,\" which had topped the Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart earlier and continued to accumulate streams globally. He secured the Artist of the Year award at the Billboard Latin Music Awards, marking one of ten wins that year and underscoring his lead in Latin music metrics. This recognition highlighted his unprecedented streaming figures, as he ranked among Billboard's Greatest Pop Stars of 2021, driven by fan-driven plays on platforms like Spotify.\n\nAdapting to post-pandemic live performances, Bad Bunny headlined the \"P FKN R\" concert on December 10 and 11 at Estadio Hiram Bithorn in San Juan, Puerto Rico, drawing approximately 50,000 attendees per night in a stadium-filling event that featured surprise guests and a three-hour setlist. Announced on August 18, the shows emphasized Puerto Rican pride and marked a significant return to large-scale touring, with rapid sell-outs reflecting robust fan engagement via social media announcements.\n\nBad Bunny expanded beyond music into acting with his debut role in the third season of Netflix's *Narcos: Mexico*, released on November 5, portraying a minor narco figure in a cameo that showcased his versatility amid his rising profile. This venture aligned with his strategy of diversifying public presence while maintaining focus on authentic fan connections through platforms like Instagram, where he teased performances and interacted directly with supporters.\n\n## Peak commercial era\n\n### 2022: Un Verano Sin Ti and record-breaking streams\n\nUn Verano Sin Ti, Bad Bunny's fourth studio album, was released on May 6, 2022, comprising 23 tracks entirely in Spanish that drew from reggaeton, bachata, and other Latin genres to evoke a summer aesthetic. The project debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, marking his second consecutive chart-topping album, with first-week equivalent album units of 274,000 in the United States.\n\nThe album achieved unprecedented streaming dominance, becoming Spotify's most-streamed album globally for 2022 and the first to surpass 10 billion streams on the platform by a Latin artist. Standout tracks included \"Me Porto Bonito\" featuring Chencho Corleone, which topped Billboard's Hot Latin Songs chart for 20 weeks and reached No. 4 on the Hot 100, while \"Titi Me Preguntó\" debuted at No. 1 on the Hot 100, Bad Bunny's first such entry as lead artist. These milestones highlighted the album's role in elevating Spanish-language music on U.S. charts, driven by verifiable streaming metrics rather than promotional narratives.\n\nSupporting the album's rollout, Bad Bunny launched the World's Hottest Tour in August 2022, selling out multiple North American stadiums including SoFi Stadium and generating over $435 million in gross revenue across 81 dates that year, setting a record for the highest-earning tour by a Latin artist. Concurrently, Bad Bunny was named Spotify's most-streamed artist globally for the third consecutive year, accumulating 18.5 billion streams in 2022 as the first non-English-language act to achieve this streak, underscoring a data-backed surge in Latin music's international consumption.\n\n### 2023: Nadie Sabe Lo Que Va a Pasar Mañana and wrestling crossover\n\nOn October 13, 2023, Bad Bunny released his fifth studio album, *Nadie Sabe Lo Que Va a Pasar Mañana*, which marked a return to trap influences while emphasizing introspective themes of uncertainty, personal growth, and reflection on fame's toll. The 22-track project debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart with 184,000 equivalent album units in its first week, securing Bad Bunny's third consecutive album to top the list and also claiming the top spot on the Top Latin Albums chart. Despite this strong opening, the album's first-week sales fell short of the 274,000 units achieved by his prior release *Un Verano Sin Ti* in 2022, signaling a slight dip in peak commercial momentum amid a shift toward more vulnerable lyrical content over mainstream pop-reggaeton hooks.\n\nParallel to his music output, Bad Bunny deepened his involvement in professional wrestling through WWE, culminating in a high-profile singles victory that highlighted both the appeal and physical hazards of such crossovers. On May 6, 2023, at WWE Backlash held in San Juan, Puerto Rico's Coliseo de Puerto Rico José Miguel Agrelot, Bad Bunny defeated Damian Priest in a San Juan Street Fight main event, marking his first one-on-one win in the promotion after interference from the Latino World Order (LWO) stable turned the tide with a low blow and assistance in executing a piledriver onto a chair. The match, featuring weapons like kendo sticks, chairs, and tables, drew massive crowd energy in Bad Bunny's homeland, where he hosted the event and entered to his track \"Chambea\" amid cultural tributes to Puerto Rican heritage.\n\nThis wrestling foray underscored diversification opportunities, expanding Bad Bunny's visibility beyond music to global sports entertainment audiences, yet it also exposed risks including legitimate injuries sustained during the bout. Bad Bunny later recounted in interviews experiencing severe pain from chair shots and falls, fearing temporary paralysis and requiring medical evaluation, which illustrated the physical demands clashing with his primary career as a performer. No major fan-related legal actions directly tied to these 2023 wrestling events emerged, though Bad Bunny's heightened public profile from such ventures amplified scrutiny on his interactions with supporters, evolving his persona toward a multifaceted entertainer blending music, athletics, and cultural iconography.\n\n## Recent activities\n\n### 2024–2025: DeBÍ Tirar Más Fotos, Puerto Rico residency, and Super Bowl performance\n\nIn January 2025, Bad Bunny released his sixth solo studio album, *DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS*, on January 5, comprising 17 tracks that interpolate traditional Puerto Rican genres such as salsa, plena, and bolero, while serving as a personal homage to the island's cultural roots.  The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart and later returned to the top spot following a vinyl edition release, marking it among the year's top-selling releases with strong streaming performance driven by tracks evoking nostalgia and island identity. \n\nFrom July 11 to September 20, 2025, Bad Bunny headlined the \"No Me Quiero Ir de Aquí\" residency at the José Miguel Agrelot Coliseum in San Juan, Puerto Rico, featuring 31 sold-out performances that drew international audiences and generated hundreds of millions in economic activity for the territory.  The series boosted local tourism, hotel occupancy, and related sectors, prompting Moody's to revise its 2025 GDP growth forecast for Puerto Rico upward to 0.4% partly due to the influx of visitors and spending. Guest appearances by artists like Rauw Alejandro and Marc Anthony, alongside celebrity attendees such as LeBron James, enhanced the events' cultural draw, though ticket access favored residents, limiting some tourism spillover. \n\nOn September 28, 2025, the NFL, Apple Music, and Roc Nation announced Bad Bunny as the headliner for the Super Bowl LX halftime show on February 8, 2026, at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California, highlighting his status as a three-time Grammy winner with global streaming records.  The selection elicited backlash from some conservative commentators and fans citing concerns over his past advocacy for progressive causes, use of Spanish-language content potentially alienating non-Spanish speakers, and prior controversies including profane social media posts, though NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell affirmed on October 22, 2025, that the booking would not be reconsidered.  Amid ongoing streaming success from *DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS*, Bad Bunny teased potential returns to WWE events, building on his 2023 crossover appearances.\n\n## Artistry\n\n### Musical style and production techniques\n\nBad Bunny's music is fundamentally rooted in reggaeton and Latin trap, genres defined by the dembow rhythm—a syncopated pattern of booming kicks, sharp snares, and hi-hats that originated in dancehall and forms the backbone of tracks like \"La Romana,\" which explicitly blends trap's gritty edges with dembow's danceable pulse.  Vocal production frequently employs auto-tune for a melodic, pitched-up effect, enhancing the urban trap aesthetic while allowing rhythmic flow over sparse, bass-heavy beats.\n\nProduction credits highlight close collaborations with specialists like Tainy (Marco Masis), who crafted foundational beats for early breakthroughs and continued through hits emphasizing reggaeton's electronic percussion layers, and Sky Rompiendo (Alejandro Ramírez), who co-produced tracks such as \"UN PESO\" with J Balvin, integrating melodic synths and trap snares.   These partnerships prioritize beat construction starting with layered kick patterns and dembow loops, often built in digital audio workstations to achieve a polished, club-ready sound.\n\nHis sonic evolution shifted from the raw, electronic grit of initial Latin trap releases—featuring minimalistic hi-hat rolls and sub-bass drops—to broader fusions incorporating rock guitar riffs, bachata guitar plucks, and sampled 90s salsa horn stabs for textural depth.  Later works emphasize hybrid techniques, blending synthetic rhythms with organic elements; for instance, *Un Verano Sin Ti* (2022) merges computer-generated drum racks with live-recorded flows to simulate concert energy.\n\nBy *DeBÍ Tirar Más Fotos* (2025), production techniques pivoted toward prominent live instrumentation, recorded entirely in Puerto Rico with horns, percussion ensembles, and orchestral arrangements by conductor Carlitos López, including six-minute salsa instrumentals backed by student orchestras for authentic timbral richness over traditional electronic backings.   This approach deploys microphones on live ensembles during sessions and tours, capturing nuanced dynamics while retaining core dembow foundations in fused tracks.\n\n### Influences and thematic elements\n\nBad Bunny's artistic influences stem from Puerto Rican urban music traditions and broader Latin sounds. He has cited Vico C as a formative early inspiration, recalling at age five being drawn to the rapper's \"clean\" era of conscious, positive messaging in reggaetón precursors like hip-hop-infused tracks. This exposure shaped his appreciation for lyrical depth amid rhythmic energy. Similarly, he acknowledges Tego Calderón as a key forebears in raw, socially aware reggaetón, influencing his blend of street narratives and cultural pride. Family listening habits introduced salsa icons like El Gran Combo de Puerto Rico and Héctor Lavoe, embedding bolero ballads and Afro-Caribbean rhythms into his eclectic style.\n\nEarly thematic elements in Bad Bunny's work emphasize hedonism, celebrating nightlife, sensuality, and escapism through perreo beats and trap cadences, as seen in tracks promoting unbridled pleasure and relational conquests. These motifs recur alongside identity explorations, grappling with Puerto Rican *boricua* roots, masculinity, and diaspora tensions in a globalized context. Subtle anti-colonial undertones appear via references to island folklore, urban legends, and resistance to cultural erasure, without dominating the narrative.\n\nPost-2022 releases mark a pivot toward vulnerability, with lyrics delving into heartbreak, self-doubt, and emotional rawness—exemplified in *Un Verano Sin Ti*'s meditations on lost love and isolation, personifying personal turmoil as broader existential drift. This introspective turn contrasts earlier bravado, prioritizing candid reflection over performative toughness. While public activism highlights colonial critiques, his music largely eschews didactic political messaging, favoring implicit cultural assertions and personal catharsis until overt infusions in 2025's *DeBÍ Tirar Más Fotos*, where relational metaphors evoke Puerto Rico's post-colonial scorn and historical grievances.\n\n### Lyrical content and criticisms\n\nBad Bunny's lyrics frequently feature explicit vulgarity and sexual content, often depicting women in objectifying roles within reggaeton's party-centric narratives. In tracks like \"Safaera\" from *YHLQMDLG* (2020), he raps lines such as \"Tú 'tás pa' mí, yo pa' ti, baby, yo te lo meto hasta el cuello\" (\"You're for me, I'm for you, baby, I'll put it in you up to your neck\"), emphasizing dominance and physical conquest, which aligns with reggaeton's historical emphasis on male bravado and perreo (grinding dance) culture. Similar themes appear in \"La Noche de Anoche\" (2020) with Rosalía, where he describes aggressive sexual encounters, contributing to over 80% of his songs containing profane language according to analyses of his discography up to 2022. This explicitness necessitates radio edits; for instance, Spotify data from 2021 shows that clean versions of hits like \"Dákiti\" remove references to drugs and sex to comply with broadcast standards, reducing playtime by up to 20% in censored formats.\n\nCritics, particularly from feminist perspectives, have accused Bad Bunny of normalizing misogyny through lyrics that portray women as disposable objects for male pleasure, contrasting with his occasional \"empowering\" tracks. In \"Yo Perreo Sola\" (2020), he advocates for women dancing independently—\"Si no sabe perrear, no lo invite a bailar\" (\"If he doesn't know how to perrear, don't invite him to dance\")—which some outlets praised as progressive, yet this is undermined by dominant themes in songs like \"Booker T\" (2020), where he boasts \"Te cojo como a una fan en el mitin\" (\"I fuck you like a fan at the rally\"), glorifying exploitative encounters. Media analyses, including a 2022 study by the University of Puerto Rico's gender studies department, found that 65% of his verses reduce female characters to sexual props, arguing this perpetuates cultural degradation in Latin urban music despite his self-proclaimed feminism. Such critiques highlight a pattern where defenses frame the content as \"authentic reggaeton realism,\" reflecting island party life, but empirical review shows selective empowerment narratives often serve commercial appeal rather than consistent worldview shifts.\n\nWhile Bad Bunny addresses mental health in introspective tracks like \"Si Veo a Tu Mamá\" (2020), expressing depression—\"Yo sé que duele, pero pa' eso estamos\" (\"I know it hurts, but that's what we're here for\")—this self-awareness does not causally resolve contradictions in his broader lyrical output. Supporters cite these as evidence of evolution, yet data from lyric databases like Genius indicate persistent objectification rates above 50% across albums post-2020, suggesting performative rather than substantive change amid rising global scrutiny. Feminist critics in outlets like Remezcla argue this duality—vulnerability paired with vulgar dominance—reinforces a male-centric narrative under the guise of emotional depth, with no verifiable decline in explicit misogynistic tropes by 2023's *Nadie Sabe Lo Que Va a Pasar Mañana*.\n\n## Public persona\n\n### Fashion and cultural aesthetics\n\nBad Bunny's early fashion aesthetic drew from streetwear roots, featuring bold, colorful patterns, oversized silhouettes, and casual staples like distressed jeans and monogrammed Louis Vuitton accessories, which aligned with his emergence in the mid-2010s Puerto Rican trap scene.  This evolved into high-fashion integrations by the late 2010s, including floral-print Gucci suits that transitioned from vibrant street ensembles to more refined tailoring, as seen in red carpet appearances. His 2022 Met Gala debut in a custom Burberry suit, designed by Riccardo Tisci to evoke Gilded Age opulence with metallic accents and structured lines, marked a pivot toward avant-garde luxury while retaining personal flair through accessories like oversized hats.\n\nCentral to his aesthetic is a gender-fluid approach, incorporating elements like Jacquemus skirts, crop tops, and painted nails in public and performance contexts, presented as authentic self-expression rather than explicit activism.  These choices challenge conventional menswear norms, blending feminine silhouettes with masculine staples such as leather bombers, as demonstrated in his 2025 courtside appearance wearing flowy shorts paired with custom Adidas Ballerina sneakers in bold gold. Such styling extends to commercial partnerships, like the Adidas collaborations starting in 2023, where reimagined Forum Low sneakers sold out immediately upon release, reflecting measurable demand for his hybrid aesthetic.\n\nThe empirical footprint of his style includes high-profile media exposure, such as a solo cover for *Vogue Mexico* in May 2025—the first for a male artist in the publication's history—and features in *Vogue* slideshows cataloging his red carpet evolution.  While this has broadened menswear discussions toward fluidity, his rapid shifts from punk-inflected streetwear to designer endorsements have drawn observations of trend alignment over enduring innovation, though sales metrics like instant sell-outs underscore commercial viability without necessitating deeper cultural substantiation. \n\n### Business ventures and endorsements\n\nBad Bunny has pursued several commercial partnerships that extend his brand beyond music, leveraging his global popularity to secure lucrative endorsement deals. In March 2021, he entered a long-term collaboration with Adidas Originals, resulting in multiple sneaker releases including the Forum Low \"First Café,\" Gazelle Indoor, Adizero SL72, and a Puerto Rico-inspired Gazelle Cabo Rojo, alongside custom silhouettes like the Ballerina honoring his cultural roots. This partnership expanded in October 2024 with a co-branded collection alongside Lionel Messi, blending music and soccer iconography, and continued into 2025 with motorsport-inspired lines tied to Mercedes.\n\nAdditional endorsements include campaigns with Calvin Klein for Icon Cotton Stretch apparel in 2025, Gucci for fashion lines, Crocs for a Classic Clog collaboration, Cheetos for community-tied promotions, and Corona as part of broader lifestyle branding. These deals, often emphasizing cultural authenticity and streetwear aesthetics, have positioned Bad Bunny as a desirable endorser for luxury and consumer brands seeking Latin market penetration.\n\nMerchandise sales represent another revenue stream, with Bad Bunny generating over $500,000 in product sales during his initial WWE involvement in 2023, highlighting the profitability of crossover merchandising tied to non-music appearances. His estimated net worth reached $50 million by 2025, derived primarily from endorsement revenues, streaming royalties, and brand extensions rather than sole dependence on record label advances.\n\nSuch diversification reflects strategic acumen in mitigating risks inherent to music industry volatility, including fluctuating streams and label disputes; unlike artists locked into major label ecosystems with limited ownership, Bad Bunny's independent alignment with Rimas Entertainment—coupled with brand deals—enables greater control over intellectual property and income, avoiding pitfalls observed in peers reliant on traditional distribution without parallel ventures.\n\n## Activism and philanthropy\n\n### Political stances and public endorsements\n\nBad Bunny has expressed opposition to Puerto Rico becoming the 51st U.S. state, stating in early 2025 that he does not want the island to lose its distinct identity through full political integration, and criticizing pro-statehood advocates for favoring foreign investments and tax incentives that prioritize outsiders over local communities. He has also urged Puerto Ricans to increase voter participation in island elections, highlighting declining turnout as a concern in September 2024.\n\nThe artist has been outspoken in criticizing former President Donald Trump's administration for its response to Hurricane Maria in 2017, which devastated Puerto Rico and resulted in an estimated 2,975 to 4,645 deaths according to government and academic studies; Bad Bunny highlighted the perceived inadequacy of federal aid and Trump's visit where paper towels were distributed to victims as symbolic gestures. In October 2024, following a Trump campaign rally where comedian Tony Hinchcliffe made derogatory remarks about Puerto Ricans, Bad Bunny endorsed Kamala Harris for president by sharing her campaign video outlining support for Puerto Rico, including infrastructure improvements and economic aid. \n\nBad Bunny has used social media to advocate for feminism, such as posting messages emphasizing women's empowerment, and for LGBTQ+ rights, including wearing skirts in music videos and receiving the GLAAD Vanguard Award in 2023 for his allyship toward transgender individuals and broader queer visibility in Latin music.  His stances, however, focus predominantly on U.S. policy critiques and progressive social issues while showing limited commentary on governance failures under left-leaning administrations in Puerto Rico or broader Latin America, such as persistent corruption or economic mismanagement despite socialist-leaning policies.\n\nThese positions have drawn backlash from conservative commentators, who describe Bad Bunny as a \"Trump hater\" and anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activist for opposing deportation policies and incorporating anti-Trump imagery in his work, leading to polarized reactions including calls to reconsider his 2026 Super Bowl halftime performance announcement in September 2025. His global fanbase, predominantly young Latinos with over 70 million Instagram followers, reflects this divide, as evidenced by conservative media outrage contrasting with support from progressive Latino audiences amid broader cultural debates over his unapologetically Spanish-language, politically charged content. \n\n### Charitable efforts and the Good Bunny Foundation\n\nThe Good Bunny Foundation, formally established as Fundación Good Bunny Inc. in 2021 with operations dating to 2018, focuses on enhancing opportunities for underserved youth in Puerto Rico through initiatives in arts, music, sports, and education. Its efforts include post-Hurricane Maria disaster relief, such as partnering with Maestro Cares and UNICEF USA in 2019 to fund over $1.6 million for rebuilding community baseball fields damaged in the 2017 storm. Additional programs encompass annual distributions of sports equipment, art supplies, and musical instruments; for instance, in 2022, the foundation provided 20,000 such gifts to children during holiday drives.\n\nFinancial filings reveal variable funding levels, with total revenue reaching $2.4 million in 2022 and $1.3 million in 2023, predominantly directed toward program expenses—over 88% in 2023 ($1.9 million out of $2.15 million total). The foundation pledged $1 million in 2020 to the Know Your Rights Camp for youth legal education and has supported summer camps emphasizing creative and athletic development. However, administrative details are limited, and net assets remained under $1 million across recent years, indicating reliance on annual inflows rather than sustained endowments.\n\nWhile these activities deliver tangible short-term aid, such as equipment to thousands of children, verifiable long-term outcomes—like measurable improvements in youth skill acquisition, school retention, or community athletic participation—lack independent evaluation in public records. Engagements often align with seasonal events amid the founder's substantial personal wealth accumulation, potentially constraining scalability beyond immediate distributions.\n\n### Criticisms of activism\n\nBad Bunny's activism has faced accusations of hypocrisy, particularly from critics who argue that his public stances against U.S. colonialism and economic exploitation in Puerto Rico are undermined by his personal financial arrangements and associations with symbols of the wealth he condemns. For instance, in 2023, commentators highlighted his romantic link to Kendall Jenner, a member of a prominent American business dynasty, as inconsistent with his advocacy for Puerto Rican empowerment against elite-driven gentrification and tourism overload. Similarly, reports emerged that Bad Bunny utilized U.S. tax incentives like Act 60, which he has publicly criticized for favoring wealthy investors over local residents, prompting claims that he privately benefits from the same systems he rails against in songs and statements.\n\nFurther scrutiny arose in 2025 over his selection for the Super Bowl halftime show, where detractors labeled him a hypocrite for performing in a high-profile U.S. event shortly after expressing reluctance to tour there amid political tensions, including his anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) rhetoric and support for Latino immigrants fleeing socialist regimes.  Conservative outlets, such as the New York Post, argued this reflects performative opposition to American institutions while capitalizing on their platforms for profit, contrasting his calls for decolonization with his global commercial success under U.S.-based labels.\n\nCritics have also pointed to indirect ties between Bad Bunny's record label, Rimas Entertainment, and Venezuela's Hugo Chávez regime, whose founder reportedly served in governmental roles under the administration, raising questions about selective anti-colonialism that overlooks the economic collapses and authoritarianism in Latin American socialist states like Venezuela and Cuba—failures exacerbated by policies Bad Bunny has not publicly condemned despite advocating for regional immigrant solidarity.  These connections, per investigative reports, suggest a potential blind spot in his activism, where U.S.-centric critiques dominate without addressing comparable or worse governance issues in ideologically aligned nations, potentially prioritizing narrative over comprehensive causal analysis of underdevelopment.\n\nEmpirical assessments of his activism's tangible effects remain sparse, with high-visibility efforts like the 2019 protests against Governor Ricardo Rosselló contributing to the leader's resignation but yielding no sustained shifts in Puerto Rico's structural metrics, such as poverty rates hovering around 43% or persistent outmigration exceeding 50,000 residents annually post-Hurricane Maria, as tracked by official data. Critics contend this indicates limited follow-through beyond symbolic gestures, such as voter mobilization drives that correlated with modest turnout increases in 2020 elections but failed to alter long-term political dynamics or policy outcomes in areas like disaster recovery funding. Such observations, drawn from conservative and independent analyses, underscore claims of virtue-signaling over substantive reform, where cultural influence amplifies rhetoric without verifiable causal impact on root causes like fiscal oversight or federal-territorial relations.\n\n## Controversies\n\n### Legal disputes and public altercations\n\nIn January 2023, Bad Bunny was recorded throwing a fan's cellphone into a body of water at a beach in the Dominican Republic after the fan extended the device toward him while he was in a vehicle, prompting widespread criticism and claims of assault. Bad Bunny responded via Instagram, stating the action stemmed from a \"lack of respect\" for invading his personal space during private time, emphasizing that fame does not entitle others to disregard boundaries. No criminal charges were filed against him in connection with the incident, though it highlighted tensions between celebrity privacy and public expectations.\n\nBad Bunny initiated a copyright infringement lawsuit in March 2024 against a Spanish fan who uploaded videos of 10 songs from his February 2024 concert at Utah's Delta Center to YouTube without permission, seeking damages for bootleg distribution that allegedly harmed official recordings. The suit was voluntarily dismissed in April 2024 after the fan removed the content, illustrating Bad Bunny's efforts to control unauthorized dissemination of his performances amid his strict no-phone policy at shows.\n\nIn March 2023, Bad Bunny's former partner, Carliz De La Cruz Hernández, filed a $40 million lawsuit against him in Puerto Rico, alleging unauthorized use of her voice memos from a 2013 relationship in his 2022 track \"Si Veo a Tu Mamá,\" claiming he sampled them without consent or credit despite her retaining ownership. The suit accused him of unjust enrichment and emotional distress, pointing to the song's commercial success; as of late 2025, the case remains unresolved in court records, reflecting disputes over personal recordings in music production.\n\nBad Bunny faced a $1 million lawsuit in September 2025 from 84-year-old Puerto Rican homeowner Román Carrasco Delgado, who claimed the artist filmed his Humacao residence without full permission for a short film tied to the 2023 album *Nadie Sabe Lo Que Va a Pasar Mañana* and then recreated it for his Puerto Rico concert residency, leading to privacy invasion and unwanted tourist traffic. The plaintiff sought up to $6 million in damages for breach of contract and emotional harm, with allegations that signatures were forged on expanded usage agreements; this case underscores risks in location scouting for entertainment visuals.\n\nAdditional suits include a May 2025 copyright claim by Nigerian artist Joeboy over an uncleared Afrobeats sample in Bad Bunny's \"Mercedes Carota,\" filed after prior accusations, and a 2024 federal case against Bad Bunny and other reggaeton artists for infringing a dembow beat from \"Fish Market.\" Bad Bunny also sued a Florida brewery in 2025 for trademark infringement by using \"San Benito\"—his legal name—on beer labels and merchandise without authorization, potentially confusing consumers. These disputes, often involving intellectual property, reveal patterns where his rapid output intersects with claims of inadequate clearances, though court outcomes frequently favor quick settlements over prolonged litigation.\n\n### Accusations of misogyny and lyrical vulgarity\n\nBad Bunny's lyrics have faced accusations of misogyny due to their frequent depiction of women in explicit, objectifying sexual scenarios, as seen in the track \"Safaera\" from his 2020 album *YHLQMDLG*, which includes graphic references to non-consensual acts and female subservience that critics argue reinforce harmful gender stereotypes. Similar content appears in other songs, such as those analyzed for implicit sexism in portraying women as disposable partners, contributing to broader claims that his work perpetuates machismo within reggaeton's stylistic norms. These elements align with reggaeton's historical emphasis on hypersexual narratives rooted in urban Puerto Rican and Latin American street culture, where explicit vulgarity serves as a form of raw expression rather than deliberate endorsement of subordination.\n\nAn onstage incident during a 2019 performance with Dominican singer Natti Natasha drew specific allegations of inappropriate touching, where Bad Bunny was accused of groping her without consent while performing, prompting public outcry over boundary violations in live settings. Women's advocacy groups in Latin America have cited such lyrics and behaviors as contributing to normalized gender violence, with organizations in the Dominican Republic pushing for bans on Bad Bunny's tracks alongside other urbano artists for promoting misogynistic themes amid rising femicide rates. In response to these pressures, municipal authorities in Chihuahua, Mexico, enacted a 2023 ordinance fining performers up to $71,133 for delivering lyrics deemed sexist or violent toward women, explicitly targeting reggaeton content like Bad Bunny's that references degradation or objectification.\n\nDefenders, including cultural analysts, argue that criticisms overlook reggaeton's genre conventions, where vulgarity mirrors socioeconomic realities of marginalized communities rather than universal advocacy for misogyny, and note Bad Bunny's public condemnations of machismo, such as his 2020 Billboard Music Awards speech urging an end to sexist violence. However, this defense has been challenged as inconsistent, given the persistence of explicit content in his discography, sparking debates on whether Latin music's tolerance for such tropes clashes with evolving global standards on consent and equality, evidenced by regional play bans but limited international streaming restrictions. The tension highlights causal links between lyrical normalization and cultural attitudes, though empirical data on direct behavioral impacts remains contested, with some studies suggesting genre traditions evolve slowly amid commercial success.\n\n### Political backlash and cultural debates\n\nBad Bunny's selection as the headliner for the Super Bowl LX halftime show, scheduled for February 8, 2026, at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California, sparked intense political backlash from conservative and MAGA-aligned figures. President Donald Trump publicly denounced the choice as \"absolutely ridiculous,\" stating he had \"never heard\" of the artist despite Bad Bunny's global prominence. This criticism was amplified by concerns over Bad Bunny's history of opposing Trump administration policies, including anti-immigration measures highlighted in his music video for \"Nuevayol,\" which featured commentary on deportation risks, and his decision to skip U.S. mainland tour dates in 2025 citing fears of ICE actions against fans.\n\nA core point of contention was Bad Bunny's announcement of an all-Spanish performance, with no plans to include English to accommodate non-Spanish-speaking viewers, which critics framed as exclusionary in an event tied to American cultural identity. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene described him as a \"perverse\" and \"unwanted\" pick, calling for English to be designated the official language of the Super Bowl halftime show. Organizations like Turning Point USA proposed counterprogramming, while Newsmax host Greg Kelly urged an NFL boycott, accusing Bad Bunny of hating America, Trump, and ICE. A Change.org petition to replace him with country singer George Strait amassed over 70,000 signatures by late October 2025, signaling measurable discontent among conservative NFL enthusiasts who viewed the booking as prioritizing identity politics over broad accessibility.\n\nNFL Commissioner Roger Goodell rebuffed calls to reconsider, affirming the selection was \"carefully thought through\" to reflect the league's diversifying audience. Bad Bunny addressed detractors during his October 4, 2025, *Saturday Night Live* monologue, suggesting they \"change the channel\" if uninterested in his performance. Left-leaning outlets like Rolling Stone characterized the conservative response as an \"unhinged meltdown,\" but such dismissals overlook empirical indicators of division, including the petition's traction and online conservative forums decrying the choice as elitist for sidelining English-dominant traditions in a U.S.-centric spectacle.\n\nCultural debates extended to identity politics in music, with right-leaning critiques portraying Bad Bunny's unapologetic Puerto Rican and Spanish-language focus as challenging assimilation norms, despite his U.S. citizenship as a Puerto Rican. Some discussions invoked cultural appropriation inversely, questioning his global reggaeton promotion as diluting American event standards, though these claims persist unsubstantiated given his authentic island roots and reggaeton's Puerto Rican origins. The controversy underscored a polarized fanbase, with conservative voices emphasizing perceived anti-patriotism and linguistic barriers over Bad Bunny's commercial draw, which includes topping global streaming charts annually since 2020.\n\n## Personal life\n\n### Family background\n\nBenito Antonio Martínez Ocasio was born on March 10, 1994, to Tito Martínez, a truck driver, and Lysaurie Ocasio, a retired English schoolteacher, in Vega Baja, Puerto Rico. His father's labor-intensive occupation as a truck driver instilled a rigorous work ethic in the household, which Martínez Ocasio has credited with shaping his own perseverance in pursuing music amid early financial constraints. The family maintained a stable, low-key existence in rural Puerto Rico, free from major public scandals or disruptions that might have drawn media attention.\n\nMartínez Ocasio grew up alongside two younger brothers, Bernie and Bysael, who have largely stayed out of the spotlight despite their sibling's global prominence; Bernie has occasionally pursued modeling but avoids high-profile involvement in entertainment. The siblings were raised in a devout Catholic environment, particularly under their mother's influence, which emphasized traditional values and early exposure to music through church and home activities. This religious foundation provided continuity and moral structure, contrasting with aspects of Martínez Ocasio's later artistic expressions that challenge conventional norms, though the family's cohesion remained intact without reported internal conflicts.\n\n### Romantic relationships\n\nBad Bunny maintained significant privacy surrounding his romantic relationships, rarely confirming details publicly and allowing much information to emerge through media sightings or indirect references in his work. From 2017 to late 2022, he was in a long-term relationship with Gabriela Berlingeri, a Puerto Rican jewelry designer and musician who collaborated with him professionally. Berlingeri received co-writing credits on multiple tracks from Bad Bunny's 2020 album *YHLQMDLG*, including \"Si Veo a Tu Mamá\" and \"La Noche de Anoche,\" and appeared in the music video for \"Yo Perreo Sola\" from the same project. Their partnership remained largely out of the public eye until subtle acknowledgments in his music, with no official announcement of their split, though it coincided with Bad Bunny's subsequent high-profile links.\n\nIn early 2023, Bad Bunny began dating supermodel Kendall Jenner, with the relationship first evidenced by paparazzi photos of a double date with Justin and Hailey Bieber on February 18 in Los Angeles. Further confirmation came via public outings, including attendance at a Gucci event in Los Angeles on September 9, 2023, and horseback riding in Costa Rica later that month. The couple separated in December 2023 after approximately seven months together, reconciled in May 2024 following multiple sightings, but ultimately ended the relationship amid reports of a \"step back\" by September 2024.\n\nThese relationships highlight Bad Bunny's pattern of shielding personal details from scrutiny while inadvertently drawing attention through leaked images and event appearances, contrasting his deliberate artistic references to past partners with a post-breakup emphasis on discretion.\n\n### Speculation on sexuality\n\nSpeculation about Bad Bunny's sexuality has primarily arisen from his gender-nonconforming fashion choices, such as wearing skirts and crop tops, and performances involving drag, including his appearance in full drag for the music video of \"Yo Perreo Sola\" in March 2020, where he embodied a female character to promote women's autonomy in nightlife settings. These elements, combined with lyrics employing female pronouns to advocate for women dancing independently without male intrusion, have led some observers to interpret his work as signaling personal bisexuality or homosexuality, despite the song's explicit heterosexual framing of club dynamics. \n\nBad Bunny has addressed such interpretations by emphasizing that his sexuality remains fluid and undefined by rigid labels, stating in a 2020 interview that he does not know if he might be attracted to men in the future, but that heterosexuality does not fully encapsulate his identity. He has rejected accusations of \"queerbaiting\"—using queer aesthetics for attention without authentic identification—while noting that his style invites sexist and homophobic backlash in Puerto Rico's traditionally macho reggaeton culture, where such expressions challenge entrenched gender norms without implying same-sex orientation. His public romantic involvements have exclusively involved women, providing behavioral evidence contra to rumors of closeted homosexuality, though he has expressed disinterest in explicitly debunking speculation to fans. \n\nWithin the reggaeton genre's hyper-masculine milieu, Bad Bunny's allyship toward LGBTQ causes—evident in anti-homophobia messaging—has amplified media narratives framing him as a \"queer icon,\" yet this label persists amid scant empirical substantiation beyond performative elements like on-screen kisses in films such as *Cassandro* (2023).  Outlets with progressive leanings have highlighted fluidity to align him with identity politics, but causal analysis reveals no verified same-sex relationships or self-identification as non-heterosexual, underscoring how stylistic rebellion against machismo does not equate to altered sexual conduct. This disconnect highlights broader tendencies in entertainment reporting to infer orientation from aesthetics rather than actions, perpetuating unproven conjecture in the absence of concrete proof.\n\n## Professional wrestling\n\n### Entry into WWE and key appearances\n\nBad Bunny, a self-professed lifelong WWE fan from Puerto Rico, made his initial foray into professional wrestling through promotional appearances rather than competitive training, marking a high-profile crossover from music to sports entertainment. His first WWE television exposure occurred at the Royal Rumble event on January 31, 2021, where he performed his song \"Booker T\" live, capitalizing on his recent track dedicated to wrestling legend Booker T to generate buzz among fans. This appearance quickly translated into on-screen involvement, as Bad Bunny engaged in a scripted rivalry with wrestlers The Miz and John Morrison on Monday Night Raw starting in February 2021, including an episode on February 1 where he appeared on \"Miz TV\" and introduced ally Damian Priest.\n\nThese segments culminated in Bad Bunny's in-ring debut at WrestleMania 37 on April 10, 2021, in Tampa, Florida, where he teamed with fellow Puerto Rican Damian Priest in a tag team match against The Miz and John Morrison. Though untrained as a wrestler, Bad Bunny executed several maneuvers, including a dive from the top rope, emphasizing spectacle and celebrity draw over technical proficiency; the match highlighted his novice status while drawing significant viewership through his global music fame. WWE officials cited his participation as a means to boost merchandise sales—he became the top seller in February 2021—and ratings via crossover appeal, aligning with Bad Bunny's stated interest in honoring his Puerto Rican roots by associating with Priest and diversifying beyond reggaeton into entertainment ventures.\n\nBuilding on this novelty, Bad Bunny returned for the Royal Rumble pay-per-view on January 29, 2022, entering the men's battle royal at position 27 as a surprise participant, eliminating competitors including Sheamus before being ousted by Brock Lesnar. This appearance, held in St. Louis, Missouri, further amplified hype through integrated music elements, such as his entrance attire and crowd energy, underscoring WWE's strategy to leverage celebrity entrants for event prestige rather than sustained athletic competition. Bad Bunny later reflected on these outings as fulfilling a childhood passion for wrestling, driven by cultural pride and the thrill of risking performance in a new arena, though they remained episodic spectacles tied to his primary music career.\n\n### Championships and notable matches\n\nBad Bunny captured the WWE 24/7 Championship on February 15, 2021, during a segment on *Raw*, pinning R-Truth after Akira Tozawa's distraction allowed him to capitalize amid the title's chaotic chase rules. He held the title briefly before returning it to R-Truth on the March 15 episode of *Raw*, marking his sole WWE championship reign as a celebrity crossover performer with no prior professional wrestling training.\n\nIn his limited in-ring career, Bad Bunny participated in three competitive matches, earning praise for his athletic showmanship and crowd engagement despite critiques of his unpolished technique rooted in minimal preparation. His debut match came on the February 15, 2021, *Raw*, defeating Tozawa in a quick bout that transitioned into the 24/7 title opportunity.\n\nAt WrestleMania 37 on April 10, 2021, Bad Bunny teamed with Damian Priest to defeat The Miz and John Morrison in a tag team match, securing victory with a top-rope splash assisted by Priest's setup, highlighting his agility and alliance with Priest against Miz's earlier antagonism. This win positioned him as a supportive figure in Priest's feuds without direct pursuit of tag team titles, though he later aided Priest in segments against Miz and Morrison.\n\nBad Bunny's most prominent singles match headlined Backlash on May 6, 2023, in a San Juan Street Fight against Priest at the Coliseo de Puerto Rico in San Juan, where personal tensions from Priest's perceived disrespect to Puerto Rican culture escalated the bout. Bad Bunny retained his undefeated streak by winning via interference, as Carlito and Savio Vega attacked Priest, allowing Bad Bunny to deliver a final kendo stick shot for the pinfall after incorporating local elements like a low blow echoing Savio Vega's style. The match drew acclaim for its high-energy environment and Bad Bunny's resilience in weapons-heavy spots, though detractors noted reliance on outside help underscored his non-wrestler status.\n\n### Potential future involvement\n\nIn October 2025, WWE wrestler Damian Priest stated that Bad Bunny maintains an \"itch\" to return to the ring, having discussed it directly with him, though no firm timeline exists due to scheduling constraints. Priest emphasized that Bad Bunny is physically recovered and prepared for another match, describing the obstacle as purely logistical rather than a lack of interest or ability.\n\nBad Bunny's extensive music commitments, including a 2025-2026 tour across 20 countries with 46 scheduled concerts and a headlining performance at Super Bowl LX halftime in 2026, directly conflict with WWE's demanding travel and preparation requirements. These obligations prioritize his primary career in music, where he generates substantial revenue through global performances and recordings, over wrestling's physical demands.\n\nProspects for involvement remain limited to sporadic appearances rather than a full-time role, as evidenced by his prior three-match tenure from 2021 to 2023, balancing high-profile events like pay-per-views without sustained commitment. Economic incentives, such as drawing large Puerto Rican audiences and boosting event attendance as seen in past outings, could prompt selective returns, but these are outweighed by injury risks inherent to wrestling's high-impact style, which contrasts with less physically taxing music pursuits. Priest's comments suggest WWE maintains an open invitation, yet realistic constraints favor intermittent, schedule-permissive engagements over regular participation.\n\n## Legacy\n\n### Commercial achievements and records\n\nBad Bunny has surpassed 100 million equivalent album sales (EAS) worldwide, a milestone driven by streaming dominance and album releases like *Un Verano Sin Ti*, which became the most-streamed album in Spotify history with over 20 billion streams. He was Spotify's most-streamed artist globally for three consecutive years from 2020 to 2022, generating over 18.5 billion streams in 2022 alone, marking him as the first Latin artist to top the platform annually for that duration. As of 2025, 25 of his songs have exceeded 1 billion streams each on Spotify, a record for any Latin artist and second overall behind only Taylor Swift.\n\nOn Billboard charts, Bad Bunny holds 16 number-one singles on the Hot Latin Songs chart and became the first Latin artist to accumulate 100 entries on the Hot 100. In October 2025, Billboard honored him as the Top Latin Artist of the 21st Century at its Latin Music Awards, recognizing his record-breaking chart performance, including multiple number-one albums on the Top Latin Albums tally. His RIAA certifications include diamond status for albums such as *YHLQMDLG*, reflecting strong U.S. sales and streaming equivalents.\n\nBad Bunny has won three Grammy Awards, including Best Música Urbana Album for *Un Verano Sin Ti* in 2023, and twelve Latin Grammy Awards, primarily in urban music categories. His 30-show residency \"No Me Quiero Ir de Aquí (La Casita)\" in Puerto Rico from June to September 2025 injected an estimated $200 million into the local economy through tourism, hotel bookings, and consumer spending, particularly during the slower summer season.\n\n### Cultural and economic impact\n\nBad Bunny's music has significantly elevated reggaeton's global profile, integrating elements of trap, rock, and traditional Latin genres to attract non-Spanish-speaking audiences and foster interest in Puerto Rican Spanish dialects among language learners worldwide. His emphasis on Puerto Rican identity and anti-colonial themes in lyrics has amplified the island's cultural visibility, challenging historical dismissals of reggaeton as culturally inferior or overly vulgar.\n\nEconomically, Bad Bunny's 2025 \"No Me Quiero Ir De Aquí\" residency in San Juan, comprising 30 sold-out shows, injected between $200 million and $400 million into Puerto Rico's economy through tourism, local spending on accommodations, dining, and merchandise, while supporting sectors like audiovisual production and graphic design. This surge, exceeding initial projections of $27 million in direct attendee spending, demonstrated the causal link between high-profile Latin artist residencies and localized GDP contributions via visitor influxes.\n\nHis prominence correlates with expanded Latin music market share, as U.S. Latin genre revenue reached nearly $500 million in the first half of 2025 alone, driven partly by streaming dominance where Bad Bunny topped global charts multiple years running. Among youth, particularly Gen Z, his fusion of social commentary with accessible hooks has inspired cultural pride and individuality, though empirical streaming data underscores market-validated appeal over identity-driven narratives alone.\n\nCritics contend that Bad Bunny's ascent, fueled by platform algorithms prioritizing viral, repetitive tracks, risks commodifying and exhausting reggaeton's depth, substituting substantive innovation for hype-sustained popularity. This view posits that uncritical acclaim, often amplified by media predisposed to celebrate boundary-breaking personas, overlooks potential perpetuation of genre stereotypes while prioritizing algorithmic virality over enduring artistic merit.\n\n### Critical reception and influence on Latin music\n\nBad Bunny's music has garnered significant critical acclaim for its innovative fusion of Latin trap, reggaeton, and traditional Puerto Rican elements, positioning him as a pivotal figure in evolving urban Latin genres. Publications such as *Rolling Stone* have lauded his 2025 album *DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS* with a perfect score, hailing it as an \"instant classic\" that traverses Puerto Rico's musical heritage through haunting, regret-infused tracks. Similarly, *Pitchfork* described Bad Bunny as a \"master at work\" for synthesizing past and present Puerto Rican sounds into anthemic, cross-generational material.\n\nCritics have also highlighted detractors' concerns over stylistic repetitiveness and lyrical explicitness, with some arguing that his reliance on formulaic trap beats and dembow rhythms risks commodifying and exhausting reggaeton's core appeal. Reviews of earlier works, such as *Nadie Sabe Lo Que Va a Pasar Mañana* (2023), noted a perceived lack of energy and effort in production, contributing to accusations of sonic stagnation despite commercial dominance. Lyrical content has drawn particular scrutiny for frequent objectification of women and lewd themes, sparking moral debates in Puerto Rico where his explicit portrayals were blamed for promoting degrading attitudes, though defenders frame it as sex-positive expression.\n\nBad Bunny's influence on Latin music is empirically evident in the mainstream proliferation of trap-infused reggaeton, as he collaborated with producers like Tainy to blend hip-hop, dembow, and urban styles, elevating Spanish-language rap's global reach before even releasing a debut album in 2018. This has spawned imitators adopting his raw energy and genre-blending tactics, dubbing him the \"King of Latin Trap\" and crediting him with redefining Latin urban sounds for broader audiences. However, his dominance has faced questions of sustainability, with observers noting a potential homogenization of Latin music toward trap-heavy uniformity, diluting diverse regional flavors in favor of commodified, exportable formulas amid post-peak artistic fatigue.\n\n## Discography\n\n### Studio albums\n\nBad Bunny's studio albums have consistently achieved commercial success, with all entries reaching the top 40 of the Billboard 200 and several debuting at number one, reflecting his dominance in Latin music streaming and sales metrics. His releases emphasize trap, reggaeton, and experimental elements, often self-produced or in collaboration with close associates like Tainy.\n\n*X 100pre*, released on December 24, 2018, marked his debut studio album and peaked at number 11 on the Billboard 200.\n\n*YHLQMDLG* (Yo Hago Lo Que Me Da La Gana), his second studio album, was released on February 29, 2020, and debuted at number 2 on the Billboard 200, setting a record for the highest debut week for a Spanish-language album at the time with 179,000 equivalent album units.\n\n*El Último Tour Del Mundo*, released on November 27, 2020, became the first all-Spanish-language album to reach number 1 on the Billboard 200.\n\n*Un Verano Sin Ti*, released on May 6, 2022, debuted at number 1 on the Billboard 200 and held the position for 13 consecutive weeks, the longest run by any album in 2022.\n\n*Nadie Sabe Lo Que Va a Pasar Mañana*, released on October 13, 2023, debuted at number 1 on the Billboard 200, marking his fourth consecutive studio album to top the chart.\n\n*DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS*, released on January 5, 2025, debuted at number 1 on the Billboard 200 and maintained the top position for four weeks.\n\n### Mixtapes and compilations\n\nBad Bunny's early career featured unofficial mixtapes distributed via platforms like SoundCloud, which compiled his initial singles and features to cultivate an underground following prior to major label involvement. One such release, *El Conejo Malo (The Mixtape)*, emerged in late 2016 and was formalized in 2017 as a 10-track collection spanning approximately 48 minutes. It included tracks like \"Si Tu Novio Te Deja Sola\" featuring J Balvin and \"Me Acostumbré\" with Arcángel, blending Latin trap beats with introspective lyrics on relationships and street life, reflecting his nascent style before widespread commercial success. These mixtapes, often bootlegged or DJ-curated, played a pivotal role in building grassroots fandom in Puerto Rico and online communities, amassing thousands of streams and shares without formal promotion.\n\nIn 2020, Bad Bunny issued his first official compilation album, *LAS QUE NO IBAN A SALIR*, surprise-dropped on May 10 as a Mother's Day gift to fans, comprising 10 tracks recorded during sessions for his preceding album *YHLQMDLG* but ultimately excluded. The project, running 30 minutes and 19 seconds, featured songs such as \"Si Ella Sale\" and \"Más de Una Cita\" with Zion \\u0026 Lennox, maintaining his signature fusion of reggaeton, trap, and emotional vulnerability while experimenting with lo-fi production elements. It debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, selling over 402,000 equivalent album units in its first week, underscoring his dominance in streaming metrics despite the release's informal origins as \"leftover\" material.\n\nLater compilations include retrospective singles collections like *Da Mixtape (Singles Collection)*, released on vinyl in 2024, aggregating early hits such as \"Mayores\" with Becky G and \"MIA\" with Drake to highlight his breakthrough collaborations. These non-studio efforts, distinct from full-length albums, served to extend catalog accessibility and reinforce his catalog's depth without introducing new original content.\n\n### Singles and collaborations\n\nBad Bunny's breakthrough on the Billboard Hot 100 came via collaborations, with \"I Like It\" alongside Cardi B and J Balvin debuting on Cardi B's *Invasion of Privacy* and ascending to No. 1 for one week in July 2018, marking his first chart-topper. The track amassed over 1 billion Spotify streams and earned multi-platinum RIAA certification, reflecting its crossover appeal through blending reggaeton with hip-hop elements. Earlier features, such as on \"Te Boté (Remix)\" with Nio Garcia, Casper Magico, Ozuna, Darell, and Nicky Jam, propelled him into Latin charts, achieving 8× Diamond status from the RIAA by 2023 based on equivalent units exceeding 48 million in the U.S.\n\nTransitioning to lead singles, Bad Bunny secured 16 No. 1s on the Hot Latin Songs chart by October 2025, surpassing contemporaries in longevity and frequency. \"Yonaguni,\" released independently in April 2021, became his first solo top 10 entry on the Hot 100, peaking at No. 6 and garnering over 1.5 billion Spotify streams through viral TikTok adoption and trap-reggaeton fusion. From *Un Verano Sin Ti* (2022), \"Moscow Mule\" reached No. 4 on the Hot 100—the highest for a primarily Spanish-language track at the time—while \"Titi Me Preguntó\" hit No. 6, both certified platinum by the RIAA for over 1 million U.S. units each, driven by dembow rhythms and personal lyricism. \"Un x100to\" with Grupo Frontera, a 2023 collaboration blending cumbia with urban styles, peaked at No. 5 on the Hot 100 and crossed 1 billion Spotify streams, exemplifying his pivot toward genre-blending features.\n\nHis collaborative output includes over 100 Hot 100 entries as of January 2025, with 12 top 10s and contributions to tracks like Drake's \"MIA,\" which earned 10× Platinum RIAA status under adjusted Latin thresholds (60,000 units per platinum equivalent). By April 2024, Bad Bunny's total RIAA-certified single units exceeded 53 million, underscoring sustained commercial dominance from features evolving into lead dominance. On Spotify, 25 of his songs surpassed 1 billion streams by October 2025, a record for Latin artists, with collaborations amplifying reach across global playlists.\n\n| Song | Primary Artists | Hot 100 Peak | RIAA Certification (U.S.) |\n|------|-----------------|--------------|---------------------------|\n| \"I Like It\" | Cardi B, J Balvin, Bad Bunny | 1 | Multi-Platinum |\n| \"Te Boté (Remix)\" | Nio Garcia et al. feat.

His performance consisted of a brief cameo amid the film's high-octane vehicular sequences, leveraging his rising celebrity status rather than extensive dramatic range.\n\nIn 2022, he portrayed \"The Wolf,\" a vengeful assassin, in David Leitch's *Bullet Train*, a Sony Pictures action comedy released on August 5. The role featured a memorable fight scene opposite Brad Pitt's character, Ladybug, showcasing physicality drawn from Bad Bunny's wrestling fandom but criticized for relying on his persona over nuanced acting.  The character's backstory, revealed in a flashback, emphasized themes of loss and retaliation, though reviewers noted the part's brevity limited deeper evaluation of his skills.\n\nSubsequent roles include the lead in *Cassandro* (2023), a biopic about Mexican luchador Saúl Armendáriz, where he played a supporting part in the wrestler's journey from humiliation to stardom, aligning with his own WWE affiliations. In *Happy Gilmore 2* (2025), he appeared as Oscar Mejías, contributing to the comedy's exaggerated ensemble dynamics. Upcoming projects feature him in *Caught Stealing* (2025), a crime thriller directed by Darren Aronofsky, signaling ambitions in Hollywood but with mixed reception questioning if his draw stems more from music fame than proven thespian talent.\n\nOn television, Bad Bunny hosted *Saturday Night Live* on October 21, 2023, delivering sketches infused with his cultural references, including wrestling motifs, while also performing musically. He returned to host the Season 51 premiere on October 4, 2025, incorporating promos styled after WWE rivalries and discussing projects like *Happy Gilmore 2*. Additional appearances include cameos on WWE's *Monday Night Raw*, portraying characters like Arturo \"Kitty\" Páez in storylines that blurred his performer and on-screen personas. Guest spots on programs such as *Narcos: Mexico* and *The Daily Show* further highlight promotional rather than substantive acting engagements. Critics observe that while these outings capitalize on his charisma and marketability, they underscore a nascent acting career prioritizing visibility over versatility.\n\n### Concert tours and residencies\n\nBad Bunny's **World's Hottest Tour** in 2022 marked his first stadium outing, supporting the album *Un Verano Sin Ti*, and spanned dozens of dates across the United States and Latin America. The tour grossed $314.1 million from 1.9 million tickets sold in reported shows, contributing to a calendar-year record of $435 million when combined with earlier 2022 performances from the *El Último Tour del Mundo* leg. Productions featured expansive custom staging, including a main stage with automated elements, extended passerelles, and flying winches adapted for 31 stadium venues to enable dynamic aerial maneuvers and immersive visuals. \n\nSetlists for the tour typically opened with tracks like \"Yo no soy Celoso\" and \"Aguacero,\" progressing through hits such as \"Yonaguni,\" \"Callaíta,\" and \"Me Porto Bonito,\" blending reggaeton, trap, and Latin pop staples from his discography, with encores emphasizing high-energy anthems. Performances enforced a strict no-phone policy to maintain intimacy, leading to security ejections of fans caught recording; incidents included objects thrown at the artist during an Atlanta show when boundaries were breached, highlighting tensions between fan engagement and personal safety. \n\nIn 2025, Bad Bunny staged the **No Me Quiero Ir de Aquí** residency at San Juan's Coliseo José Miguel Agrelot, comprising 30 sold-out dates from July 11 to September 20. The series drew an estimated 600,000 attendees, shattering prior venue attendance benchmarks and generating over $700 million in economic impact through ticket sales, tourism, and related spending.   Setlists evolved to prioritize newer material alongside classics, starting with introspective cuts like \"ALAMBRE PúA\" and \"DTmF\" before building to crowd favorites, supported by multi-stage layouts that enhanced proximity in the 18,000-capacity arena.",
