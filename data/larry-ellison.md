## Early Life and Historical Background

Larry Ellison was born in New York City to an unwed Jewish mother, Florence Spellman. At nine months old, he was adopted by his aunt and uncle, Lillian and Louis Ellison, in Chicago after contracting pneumonia. Growing up on Chicago's South Side in a working-class neighborhood, Ellison showed an early aptitude for mathematics and science. However, he described his adoptive mother as distant and struggled with a sense of identity due to his adoption [Biography.com](https://www.biography.com/business-leaders/larry-ellison).

Ellison attended the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign but dropped out after his second year following the death of his adoptive mother. He later enrolled at the University of Chicago but left after one semester, opting to move to California in the 1960s to pursue opportunities in the emerging tech industry. In California, Ellison worked odd jobs, including as a programmer at Ampex Corporation, where he contributed to early database projects that would later inspire his work at Oracle [Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Larry-Ellison).

In 1977, Ellison co-founded Software Development Laboratories (SDL) with Bob Miner and Ed Oates, with an initial investment of $2,000, of which Ellison contributed $1,200. The company, later renamed Oracle Systems Corporation in 1982, focused on developing relational database management systems (RDBMS). Oracle's first commercial product, Oracle Database, was groundbreaking as one of the first commercially available relational databases, drawing inspiration from IBM's System R. Under Ellison's leadership as CEO from 1977 to 2014, Oracle grew into a global tech powerhouse [Oracle History](https://www.oracle.com/corporate/history/).

## Career and Achievements at Oracle

Ellison's tenure at Oracle is marked by aggressive business strategies and technological innovation. As CEO, he oversaw numerous acquisitions, including PeopleSoft (2005), Siebel Systems (2006), and Sun Microsystems (2010), which expanded Oracle's portfolio into enterprise resource planning, customer relationship management, and hardware systems [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/oracles-acquisition-history-2021-06-29/). His vision of cloud computing also positioned Oracle as a competitor to companies like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure in the late 2010s.

Ellison stepped down as CEO in 2014, transitioning to the roles of executive chairman and CTO, where he continues to influence Oracle's strategic direction. Under his guidance, Oracle has maintained a strong presence in the enterprise software market, with annual revenues exceeding $40 billion as of 2023 [Oracle Financials](https://investor.oracle.com/financials/default.aspx).
