  "content": "# Cristiano Ronaldo\n\nCristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro (born 5 February 1985) is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a forward for Al-Nassr in the Saudi Pro League and serves as captain of the Portugal national team.\n\nWidely regarded as one of the greatest players in the history of the sport, Ronaldo has achieved extraordinary success across club and international football, amassing over 950 career goals and numerous individual accolades. His career trajectory includes stints at major clubs such as Sporting CP, Manchester United, Real Madrid, Juventus, and Manchester United again before joining Al-Nassr in 2023, where he signed a contract extension until 2027. Ronaldo holds the record for the most goals in UEFA Champions League history with 140, and he has won the competition five times—once with Manchester United in 2008 and four times with Real Madrid between 2014 and 2018.\n\nOn the international stage, Ronaldo led Portugal to victory in the UEFA European Championship in 2016—the country's first major trophy—and the UEFA Nations League in 2019 and 2025, scoring 143 goals in 226 appearances to become the men's all-time leading international goalscorer. His individual honors include five Ballon d'Or awards (2008, 2013, 2014, 2016, 2017), four European Golden Shoes, and three FIFA The Best Men's Player awards, underscoring his dominance as a goalscorer and versatile forward. Beyond the pitch, Ronaldo is known for his philanthropy, business ventures, and status as one of the most marketable athletes globally, with a social media following exceeding 1 billion across platforms.\n\n## Early life\n\n### Family background and childhood\n\nCristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro was born on 5 February 1985 in the Santo António parish of Funchal, the capital of Madeira, an autonomous Portuguese island in the Atlantic Ocean, as the youngest of four children to José Dinis Aveiro and Maria Dolores dos Santos Viveiros Aveiro. His father worked as a municipal gardener and part-time kit man for Andorinha, a local club, while his mother held multiple low-paying jobs as a cook and cleaner to support the family amid financial struggles. Ronaldo's older siblings included his brother Hugo and sisters Elma and Liliana Cátia, known as Kátia, who helped navigate the family's hardships.\n\nThe Aveiro family lived in a modest bungalow in a working-class neighborhood of Funchal, emblematic of Madeira's close-knit island communities shaped by Portuguese colonial heritage and economic reliance on agriculture and tourism. However, their circumstances were marked by poverty and instability; Ronaldo's father, a veteran of Portugal's colonial wars in Africa, battled depression and alcoholism, which strained family dynamics and led to his parents' separation. José Dinis Aveiro died in September 2005 from liver failure related to his drinking, when Ronaldo was 20 years old. Maria Dolores often worked long hours away from home, even emigrating temporarily to Paris for employment, leaving the children to fend amid limited resources.\n\nRonaldo's early years were further complicated by behavioral challenges, culminating in his expulsion from school at age 14 after throwing a chair at a teacher in frustration over his disruptive conduct and focus on football. Growing up in Madeira's insular environment, where family ties and resilience were cultural cornerstones, these socio-economic pressures instilled a strong work ethic, though they also exposed him to instability that later influenced his drive for success. This early passion for football provided an escape, setting the stage for his youth development.\n\n### Introduction to football and youth development\n\nCristiano Ronaldo's introduction to organized football began at the age of seven in 1992, when he joined the local amateur club Andorinha in Funchal, Madeira, where his father worked as a kitman and enlisted the help of a friend, coach Fernão Sousa, to secure his spot on the team. There, Ronaldo quickly displayed exceptional dribbling skills and speed, earning the nickname \"Little Bee\" (abelhinha) from teammates and coaches for his rapid movements on the pitch, reminiscent of a buzzing insect. His early passion for the sport was evident, though he often cried in frustration after losses, a trait that highlighted his competitive nature even as a child.\n\nBy age ten in 1995, Ronaldo moved to another local club, Clube Desportivo Nacional, where he continued to hone his abilities, captaining youth teams and competing against older players while scoring prolifically. His talent attracted scouts, leading to a trial and signing with Sporting CP's youth academy, known as Sporting Juniors, at age twelve in 1997, which required relocating from Madeira to Lisbon—a move supported by his family despite the challenges. The transition proved difficult; Ronaldo suffered from severe homesickness, briefly returning to Madeira before his mother's encouragement prompted him to persist, though he faced bullying over his regional accent.\n\nDuring his time in Sporting's academy, Ronaldo underwent significant physical development, growing from 1.60 meters to 1.85 meters, which enhanced his presence on the field. He also confronted a health scare at age fifteen in 2000, diagnosed with tachycardia—a condition causing an irregularly racing heartbeat—and underwent laser surgery to cauterize the problematic area, allowing him to resume training within days without long-term interruption. Committed to improvement, Ronaldo adopted a rigorous training regimen, often staying after sessions to practice dribbling and shooting, which contributed to his rapid progression. By 2002, at age 17, he had been promoted to Sporting's senior team, solidifying his status as a standout prospect.\n\n## Club career\n\n### Sporting CP (2002–2003)\n\nRonaldo made his professional debut for Sporting CP on 14 August 2002, coming on as a substitute for the final 33 minutes in a UEFA Champions League third qualifying round match against Inter Milan, which ended in a 0–2 home defeat. His first appearance in the Primeira Liga came on 29 September 2002, substituting in for 22 minutes during a 3–0 away win over Braga. Ronaldo scored his first professional goals just over a week later, netting twice in a 3–0 league victory against Moreirense on 7 October 2002, showcasing his dribbling ability with a run past multiple defenders for one of the strikes.\n\nDuring the 2002–2003 season, the 17-year-old winger featured in 31 matches across all competitions for Sporting CP, contributing 5 goals and establishing himself as a promising talent emerging from the club's youth academy. His performances included a goal in the UEFA Cup against Partizan Belgrade on 3 October 2002 and additional strikes in the Taça de Portugal, helping Sporting finish third in the Primeira Liga.\n\nRonaldo's breakthrough moment arrived in a pre-season friendly on 6 August 2003 against Manchester United at Sporting's new Estádio José Alvalade, where he dazzled with skillful dribbles, crosses, and a goal in a 3–1 win, earning the nickname \"Magic Box\" from opponents and impressing Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson. This display prompted initial discussions of a loan deal, but negotiations quickly escalated to a permanent transfer. On 12 August 2003, just six days later, Manchester United signed Ronaldo for £12.24 million, a record fee for a teenager in English football at the time.\n\n### Manchester United (2003–2007)\n\nCristiano Ronaldo joined Manchester United from Sporting CP on 12 August 2003, at the age of 18, in a transfer deal worth £12.24 million. He was assigned the iconic number 7 shirt, previously worn by David Beckham, a decision influenced by manager Sir Alex Ferguson to accelerate his integration into the squad. Upon arrival, Ronaldo faced significant adaptation challenges, including intense media scrutiny in England and criticism for his flamboyant style, particularly his frequent use of stepovers, which Ferguson warned him against overdoing to avoid alienating teammates and opponents. Despite these hurdles, his raw talent and work ethic began to shine, marking the start of his transformation from a promising winger to a pivotal player.\n\nIn the 2003–04 season, Ronaldo made 40 appearances across all competitions, scoring 6 goals as he adjusted to the physicality and pace of English football. His debut came in a 4–0 Premier League win over Bolton Wanderers on 16 August 2003, where he provided an assist and impressed with his dribbling. Ronaldo netted his first goal for the club—and his first in the Premier League—on 1 November 2003, curling a stunning free-kick past Portsmouth goalkeeper Shaka Hislop in a 3–0 victory at Old Trafford. These moments highlighted his potential as an entertainer on the wing, though United finished third in the league and exited the Champions League early.\n\nThe 2004–05 season saw further development, with Ronaldo contributing 9 goals in 50 appearances as he became a more consistent starter. A standout moment came in the FA Cup final against Arsenal on 21 May 2005 at the Millennium Stadium, where the match ended 0–0 after extra time; Ronaldo successfully converted his penalty in the shootout, helping United secure a 5–4 victory and their first major trophy of his tenure. His dynamic runs and crosses, including key involvement in build-up play during the final, underscored his growing influence, even as United struggled in the league, finishing third amid internal tensions.\n\nRonaldo's progress accelerated in the 2005–06 season, where he scored 12 goals in 47 appearances, showcasing improved finishing and creativity. A highlight was his brace against Aston Villa on 23 April 2006 in a 3–1 Premier League win, with both goals demonstrating his speed and precision— the first a low drive after a solo run, the second a header from a corner. These efforts helped United reach the FA Cup final, though they lost to Liverpool on penalties, and earned Ronaldo recognition for his evolution into a more complete attacker.\n\nBy the 2006–07 season, Ronaldo had fully emerged as a key figure, recording 23 goals and 14 assists across all competitions in 53 appearances, shifting perceptions from flair provider to prolific scorer. His contributions were instrumental in Manchester United's Premier League title win, ending Chelsea's two-year dominance, with notable performances including a hat-trick in a 6–0 thrashing of Derby County. Ronaldo capped his breakthrough year by winning the PFA Young Player of the Year award, as well as the PFA Players' Player of the Year, reflecting his 17 league goals and overall impact. In the FA Cup, he played a central role in reaching the final against Chelsea, scoring crucial goals in earlier rounds, though United fell 1–0 in extra time to Didier Drogba's winner. This period solidified Ronaldo's status as one of Europe's rising stars.\n\n### Manchester United (2007–2009)\n\nDuring the 2007–08 season, Ronaldo emerged as one of the world's premier forwards, scoring 42 goals in 49 appearances across all competitions for Manchester United. His prolific output included 31 goals in the Premier League, earning him the Golden Boot as the league's top scorer, and 8 goals in the UEFA Champions League, where he claimed the top scorer honor. Ronaldo's contributions were instrumental in Manchester United's successful campaign, culminating in victories in the Premier League and the UEFA Champions League. In the Champions League final against Chelsea on May 21, 2008, at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow, Ronaldo opened the scoring with a header in the 26th minute, but the match ended 1–1 after extra time, leading to a penalty shootout; he missed United's third penalty, yet the team prevailed 6–5 to secure the title.\n\nRonaldo's exceptional form that year was recognized with the Ballon d'Or in December 2008, awarded by *France Football*, making him the third Portuguese player to win the honor after Eusébio in 1965 and Luís Figo in 2000. He also received the FIFA World Player of the Year award in January 2009, becoming the first Manchester United player to achieve this distinction. These accolades highlighted his transformation from a flair-driven winger, often criticized for showboating in his earlier United years, into a decisive goal-scorer capable of delivering in high-stakes moments.\n\nIn the 2008–09 season, Ronaldo maintained his high level of performance, netting 26 goals in 53 appearances as Manchester United defended their Premier League title and won the FIFA Club World Cup in December 2008, defeating LDU Quito 1–0 in the final, where he earned the Silver Ball as the tournament's second-best player. His partnership with forwards Wayne Rooney and Carlos Tevez formed a dynamic attacking trio that overwhelmed defenses, contributing to United's domestic dominance with Ronaldo providing pace, Rooney's versatility, and Tevez's tenacity in pressing and finishing. This evolution from early criticisms of excessive dribbling to clutch contributions solidified his status as a team leader during this period.\n\nAs the season concluded, speculation about Ronaldo's future intensified, leading to a protracted transfer saga with Real Madrid. On June 11, 2009, Manchester United accepted a world-record €94 million bid from the Spanish club, with the deal formally completed on July 6, 2009, marking the end of his first stint at Old Trafford.\n\n### Real Madrid (2009–2014)\n\nCristiano Ronaldo joined Real Madrid from Manchester United in July 2009 for a world-record transfer fee of €94 million, signing a six-year contract. He was unveiled at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium to a crowd of 80,000 fans, marking one of the largest attendances for a player presentation in club history. Early in his tenure, Ronaldo faced adaptation challenges in La Liga, including an ankle injury that sidelined him for two months and criticism for missed scoring opportunities amid high expectations. Despite this, he scored 33 goals across all competitions in the 2009–10 season, including 26 in La Liga, helping Real Madrid finish second in the league.\n\nIn the 2010–11 season, Ronaldo elevated his performance, netting 53 goals in 54 appearances, with 40 in La Liga to claim the Pichichi Trophy as the league's top scorer. His contributions were pivotal in Real Madrid's Copa del Rey triumph, where he scored the winning goal in a 1–0 final victory over Barcelona, securing the club's first major trophy in 18 years. Real Madrid also reached the UEFA Champions League semi-finals that year, though Ronaldo managed only six goals in the competition due to a quarter-final exit against Barcelona.\n\nRonaldo's form peaked in the 2011–12 season under manager José Mourinho, as he scored 60 goals in 55 games, including a La Liga-high 46 to win his second Pichichi Trophy. This output propelled Real Madrid to the La Liga title, ending Barcelona's three-year dominance with a record 100 points and a nine-point lead over their rivals. He added 10 goals in the Champions League, helping the team reach the semi-finals again.\n\nThe 2012–13 season saw Ronaldo score 55 goals for Real Madrid, highlighted by 12 in the Champions League en route to the semi-finals. He contributed to the Supercopa de España victory over Barcelona with goals in both legs of the 4–4 aggregate win, decided on away goals. Across the calendar year of 2013, Ronaldo amassed a record 69 goals in 59 matches for club and country, earning him his second Ballon d'Or award.\n\nDuring the 2013–14 season, Ronaldo recorded 51 goals in 47 appearances, including a Champions League-record 17 to lead Real Madrid to La Décima, their tenth European Cup title. In the final against Atlético Madrid, he scored the equalizer in extra time and converted in the penalty shootout after Sergio Ramos's dramatic 93rd-minute leveler. Ronaldo also netted three goals in the Copa del Rey, which Real Madrid won 2–1 against Barcelona in the final, and he claimed his third Pichichi with 31 La Liga goals. His exceptional year culminated in a third consecutive Ballon d'Or.\n\nThroughout his first five years at Real Madrid, Ronaldo's rivalry with Barcelona and Lionel Messi intensified, particularly in El Clásico matches, where he scored 10 goals in 14 encounters from 2009 to 2014, often in high-stakes games that defined the era's dominance battles. This period also showcased his physical evolution, transitioning from a lean winger to a more muscular goal poacher through rigorous training, including daily gym sessions and a focus on core strength and explosiveness, which enhanced his aerial ability and durability. His renowned work ethic, involving extra practice after team sessions, became a hallmark, enabling sustained high performance amid the demands of La Liga and European competitions.\n\n### Real Madrid (2014–2018)\n\nDuring the 2014–2018 period at Real Madrid, Cristiano Ronaldo solidified his status as the club's all-time leading goalscorer, amassing a remarkable tally that underscored his evolution into a prolific finisher and key architect of the team's unprecedented success in European competitions. Under managers Carlo Ancelotti and later Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo contributed to three consecutive UEFA Champions League triumphs, a feat unmatched in the competition's history, while his individual brilliance earned him his fifth Ballon d'Or in 2017. This era marked his transition from a predominantly left-sided forward to a central striker role, enhancing his positioning inside the penalty area and amplifying his goal-scoring output.\n\nIn the 2014–15 season, Ronaldo delivered one of his most prolific campaigns, scoring 61 goals across all competitions in 54 appearances, including 10 in the UEFA Champions League where he shared the top-scorer honor with Lionel Messi and Neymar. Despite Real Madrid finishing second in La Liga and exiting the Champions League in the semi-finals, Ronaldo's form was pivotal in securing the UEFA Super Cup with a 2–0 victory over Sevilla, where he netted both goals. His consistency highlighted his growing dominance, building on his earlier Madrid years to approach the club's historical scoring benchmarks.\n\nThe 2015–16 season saw Ronaldo score 55 goals in 48 games, culminating in Real Madrid's 11th Champions League title after a tense 1–1 draw with Atlético Madrid in the final, followed by a 5–3 penalty shootout win in Milan, where Ronaldo converted the decisive spot-kick despite an earlier injury. A standout moment came in the quarter-final second leg against VfL Wolfsburg, where his hat-trick overturned a 2–0 deficit from the first leg, securing a 3–0 victory and advancing Madrid to the semi-finals. This performance also propelled him past club legends in the scoring charts, as he had already surpassed Alfredo Di Stéfano's 307-goal record earlier that year in May 2015 during a league match against Espanyol.\n\nRonaldo's 2016–17 campaign yielded 42 goals in 46 matches, powering Real Madrid to a historic double of La Liga and Champions League titles—the first such achievement for the club since 1958. In the Champions League final against Juventus in Cardiff, Madrid triumphed 4–1, with Ronaldo scoring the opener and providing an assist, capping a tournament where he netted 12 goals. His contributions extended to the FIFA Club World Cup in December 2016, where a hat-trick in the final against Kashima Antlers secured a 4–2 extra-time victory after trailing 2–1, earning him the tournament's Golden Ball. These accomplishments earned Ronaldo his fifth Ballon d'Or in December 2017, awarded on the Eiffel Tower in Paris for his pivotal role in Madrid's triumphs.\n\nBy the 2017–18 season, Ronaldo had scored 44 goals in 44 appearances, helping Real Madrid claim a third consecutive Champions League title with a 3–1 win over Liverpool in Kyiv, where he opened the scoring with a bicycle kick. The team also lifted the Spanish Super Cup after defeating Barcelona 5–1 on aggregate in August 2017. Over his final season in Madrid, Ronaldo reached the milestone of 450 goals in 438 competitive matches, establishing an all-time club record that surpassed Raúl's 323. Amid this success, Ronaldo adapted to a more central striker position under Zidane, focusing on poaching opportunities in the box rather than wide play, which boosted his aerial threat and finishing efficiency. Concurrently, in June 2017, Spanish tax authorities initiated an investigation into Ronaldo's image rights income from 2011–2014, alleging evasion of €14.7 million, though he maintained his innocence during a July court appearance in Madrid.\n\n### Juventus (2018–2020)\n\nOn 10 July 2018, Juventus signed Cristiano Ronaldo from Real Madrid for a transfer fee of €100 million, marking the highest fee ever paid for a player over the age of 30 at the time; he agreed to a four-year contract until June 2022. Following his legacy at Real Madrid, where he had won four Champions League titles and become the club's all-time leading scorer, Ronaldo's arrival was seen as a strategic move to bolster Juventus's European ambitions. He made his competitive debut for the club on 18 August 2018 in a 3–2 Serie A away win against Chievo Verona, entering as a substitute in the 58th minute. Ronaldo scored his first goal for Juventus on 16 September 2018, netting a brace in a 2–1 Serie A home victory over Sassuolo, becoming the oldest player at 33 years and 8 months to score multiple goals on his league debut for the club.\n\nIn the 2018–19 season, Ronaldo recorded 28 goals across all competitions, including 21 in 31 Serie A appearances, tying Fabio Quagliarella for the Capocannoniere award as the league's top scorer. His contributions helped Juventus secure their eighth consecutive Serie A title on 20 April 2019 with a 2–1 comeback win against Fiorentina, in which Ronaldo scored the equalizing goal. The team also won the Supercoppa Italiana on 16 January 2019, defeating AC Milan 1–0 in a penalty shootout, with Ronaldo converting the decisive spot-kick. Juventus fans embraced Ronaldo warmly from the outset, with his signing generating immense excitement and placing significant pressure on him to deliver a Champions League triumph, the club's first since 1996.\n\nRonaldo's form peaked in the 2019–20 season, where he netted 37 goals in 46 appearances across all competitions, including a league-high 31 in Serie A to claim the Capocannoniere outright and become the first player in history to win the top-scorer award in England's Premier League, Spain's La Liga, and Italy's Serie A. These efforts propelled Juventus to their ninth consecutive Serie A title, clinched on 26 July 2020 after a 2–0 win over Sampdoria. In the Coppa Italia, he scored four goals en route to the final, though Juventus lost 0–0 (4–2 on penalties) to Napoli on 17 June 2020. The club's Champions League campaign ended in the quarter-finals, eliminated by Lyon on away goals (aggregate 2–2) despite Ronaldo's brace in a 2–1 second-leg victory on 7 August 2020, bringing his career Champions League tally to 130 goals.\n\nRonaldo's impact extended to breaking records, such as becoming the oldest player to score 25 goals in a single Serie A season during 2019–20 at age 34. His presence transformed Juventus's attack, fostering a high-scoring environment while adapting to the tactical demands of Italian football, though the persistent Champions League pressure underscored the expectations placed on him by supporters and the club.\n\n### Juventus (2020–2021)\n\nIn the 2020–21 season, Ronaldo's third and final year at Juventus under manager Andrea Pirlo, he remained the team's focal point in attack despite turning 36 in February. He scored 36 goals across all competitions in 44 appearances, including 29 in Serie A from 33 matches, securing his second Capocannoniere award as the league's top scorer.\n\nRonaldo reached a significant milestone on 12 May 2021, netting his 100th goal for Juventus in a 3–1 Serie A victory over Sassuolo, achieving the mark in just 131 games—the fastest in club history. He concluded his Juventus tenure with 101 goals in 134 appearances across all competitions. In the Coppa Italia, which Juventus won for a record-extending 14th time, Ronaldo contributed two goals, including a brace in the semi-final second leg against Inter Milan on 2 February 2021, helping secure a 2–1 win and a 4–2 aggregate victory. He also scored the winner in the Supercoppa Italiana against Napoli in January.\n\nDespite Ronaldo's individual brilliance, Juventus struggled collectively, finishing fourth in Serie A and missing out on an automatic Champions League group stage spot for the following season. In Europe, they were eliminated in the Champions League round of 16 by Porto, drawing 4–4 on aggregate but losing on away goals after a dramatic 3–2 extra-time defeat in the second leg on 9 March 2021. Ronaldo scored four goals in six Champions League matches, including one in the first leg against Porto.\n\nAs scrutiny mounted over Ronaldo's perceived dip in overall involvement and the team's defensive frailties at age 36, his contract—originally set to expire in 2022—was mutually terminated on 31 August 2021, allowing a free transfer departure. This decision followed earlier talks of a potential extension, amid Juventus' shift toward financial restructuring and a younger squad dynamic.\n\n### Manchester United return (2021–2022)\n\nIn August 2021, Cristiano Ronaldo rejoined Manchester United on a free transfer from Juventus, signing a two-year contract until June 2023. The move, orchestrated by agent Jorge Mendes amid interest from Manchester City, marked an emotional homecoming after 12 years away, with Ronaldo expressing that he felt \"back where I belong.\" Upon his unveiling, fans at Old Trafford paid tribute with a standing ovation and chants, highlighting his enduring legacy from his first stint at the club.\n\nRonaldo made an immediate impact in his second debut on 11 September 2021, scoring a brace in a 4–1 Premier League victory over Newcastle United at Old Trafford. His first goal came in stoppage time of the opening half from a rebound, followed by a late strike to seal the win, evoking widespread celebration among supporters.\n\nDuring the 2021–22 season, Ronaldo featured in 38 matches across all competitions, scoring 24 goals and providing 3 assists, emerging as the team's top scorer. He netted 18 goals in 30 Premier League appearances, earning two Player of the Month awards for September and October. In the UEFA Europa League, Ronaldo contributed 6 goals in 8 games, helping United advance to the quarter-finals before a 1–0 aggregate defeat to Atlético Madrid. Key highlights included a hat-trick in a 3–2 league win over Tottenham Hotspur in March 2022 and becoming Manchester United's all-time leading Champions League scorer with 105 goals during an earlier group-stage match. By the season's end, his tally reached 145 career goals for the club, solidifying his status amid ongoing tributes from fans and former teammates.\n\nThe 2022–23 campaign began promisingly, with Ronaldo scoring 3 goals in 16 appearances before tensions escalated. Under new manager Erik ten Hag, appointed in April 2022, Ronaldo was increasingly benched, leading to public frustration. In a November 2022 interview with Piers Morgan, Ronaldo criticized ten Hag for lacking respect, accused the club of betrayal in its modernization efforts, and questioned the commitment of some teammates, stating he felt forced out. The unauthorized release of clips from the interview prompted Manchester United to initiate disciplinary action.\n\nOn 22 November 2022, Manchester United and Ronaldo mutually agreed to terminate his contract with immediate effect, allowing him to seek a new club as a free agent. Over his second stint, spanning 54 appearances, he scored 27 goals in total. Despite his individual output, the team finished sixth in the 2021–22 Premier League with 58 points, qualifying for the Europa League.\n\n### Al-Nassr (2023–present)\n\nCristiano Ronaldo joined Al-Nassr in December 2022, signing a 2.5-year contract worth €200 million per year, the highest annual salary in football history. He made his debut on 22 January 2023 against Al-Ettifaq in the Saudi Pro League, starting as captain in a 1–0 victory, though he did not score.\n\nIn the 2022–23 season, Ronaldo scored 14 goals in 19 appearances across all competitions despite joining midway through the campaign. He finished as the top scorer in the Arab Club Champions Cup with six goals, helping Al-Nassr win their first title in the competition.\n\nDuring the 2023–24 season, Ronaldo netted 35 goals in 31 Saudi Pro League matches to claim the Golden Boot and a league-record single-season tally, while scoring 50 goals in 51 games overall. Al-Nassr finished second in the league but exited the AFC Champions League in the quarter-finals.\n\nIn June 2025, Ronaldo signed a two-year contract extension with Al-Nassr, securing his stay until 2027 on a deal valued at approximately €492 million, including perks like private jet credits and personal staff support. By November 2025, he had scored 109 goals in 122 appearances for the club, surpassing his previous non-European scoring record and bringing his career total to 953 goals. In the 2025 calendar year alone, he recorded 37 goals in 42 matches for club and country. Al-Nassr led the Saudi Pro League standings at that point, though they had yet to achieve success in continental competitions like the AFC Champions League.\n\nIn a November 2025 interview with Piers Morgan, Ronaldo hinted at an imminent retirement, stating it would happen \"soon\" to prioritize family time and other passions, adding that the transition would be emotional and likely bring him to tears.\n\n## International career\n\n### Youth international career\n\nRonaldo began his international career with Portugal's youth teams in 2001, making his debut for the under-15 side on 24 February 2001 against South Africa in a tournament in Lisbon, where he scored the winning goal in a 2-1 victory. He went on to make nine appearances for the U15 team, scoring seven goals in total. This early success marked the start of his rapid progression through the national youth ranks, showcasing his speed, skill, and goal-scoring ability from a young age.\n\nIn 2002, Ronaldo featured for the Portugal under-17 team at the UEFA European Under-17 Championship in Poland, where Portugal reached the semi-finals before losing to France on penalties. He appeared in five matches for the U17 side across qualification and the tournament, contributing three goals overall. The following year, he represented the under-20 team at the 2003 FIFA World Youth Championship in the United Arab Emirates, scoring one goal as Portugal exited in the group stage after defeats to Spain and Brazil, and a win over the United States. Ronaldo made five appearances for the U20s, netting five goals in total during his time with the age group.\n\nRonaldo's most prominent youth international spell came with the under-21 team, where he debuted in August 2002 and quickly became a key player and eventual captain. At the 2004 UEFA European Under-21 Championship in Germany and Switzerland, he led Portugal to the semi-finals with an outstanding performance, scoring four goals—including two against England in the semi-final loss—to finish as the tournament's top scorer. He also served as an alternate for Portugal's Olympic team at the 2004 Athens Games but did not play. Across his under-21 career, Ronaldo made 21 appearances and scored five goals, earning praise for his leadership and versatility on the wing. In total, he accumulated 34 caps for Portugal's youth teams, scoring 18 goals, which paved the way for his inclusion in the senior squad for UEFA Euro 2004 at the age of 19.\n\n### Senior international career\n\nCristiano Ronaldo made his senior international debut for Portugal on 20 August 2003, coming on as a second-half substitute in a friendly match against Kazakhstan in Chaves, which ended in a 1-0 victory. At the age of 18, he replaced Luís Figo and impressed with his pace and skill, marking the beginning of a prolific career with the national team.\n\nIn UEFA Euro 2004, hosted by Portugal, Ronaldo featured in all seven matches as the team reached the final but lost 1-0 to Greece. He scored his first international goal in the group stage against Greece and celebrated Wayne Rooney's red card with a wink toward the Portugal bench during the quarter-final against England, which Portugal won on penalties (6–5), with Ronaldo scoring his kick. At the 2006 FIFA World Cup, Ronaldo played every minute for Portugal, who advanced to the semi-finals before losing to France; in the quarter-final against England, Ronaldo was involved in the sending-off of Wayne Rooney before converting his penalty in the shootout win (3–1).\n\nPortugal exited in the quarter-finals of UEFA Euro 2008, with Ronaldo scoring one goal in the tournament. At the 2010 FIFA World Cup, the team reached the round of 16, where Ronaldo scored once before a 1-0 defeat to Spain; he netted seven goals in qualifying, contributing to Portugal's advancement. In the 2014 World Cup, an injury limited Ronaldo to two appearances as Portugal exited the group stage after losses to Germany and the United States.\n\nRonaldo's standout performance came at the 2018 World Cup, where he scored a hat-trick in the 3-3 group stage draw against Spain, including a late free-kick equalizer, though Portugal were eliminated in the round of 16 by Uruguay. As captain since November 2008, Ronaldo led Portugal to victory at UEFA Euro 2016, their first major title, scoring three goals including in the 3-0 semi-final win over Wales; he suffered a knee injury early in the final against France but remained influential from the sidelines as Portugal won on penalties. In the 2019 UEFA Nations League final, Ronaldo's hat-trick secured a 3-1 semi-final victory over Switzerland, paving the way for Portugal's 1-0 win over the Netherlands in the final to claim the inaugural title.\n\nAt the 2022 FIFA World Cup, Ronaldo scored in the 3-2 group stage win over Ghana but was benched for the round of 16 loss to Morocco, ending Portugal's quarter-final hopes. Portugal were knocked out in the round of 16 at UEFA Euro 2020 by Belgium, with Ronaldo scoring five goals to become the tournament's top scorer. In Euro 2024, Ronaldo missed a crucial extra-time penalty against Slovenia in the round of 16, leading to visible emotion, before Portugal advanced on penalties but fell to France in the quarter-finals.\n\nPortugal defended their Nations League title in the 2024-25 edition, defeating Spain 5-3 on penalties in the final on 8 June 2025 after a 2-2 draw, with Ronaldo scoring to level the match. Ronaldo holds the all-time men's international goal record with 143 goals in 226 appearances for Portugal as of November 2025, including a record 41 goals in World Cup qualifiers (set with two goals against Hungary on 15 October 2025 in a 3-1 win). In November 2025, Ronaldo stated he plans to retire in \"one or two years,\" with the 2026 World Cup as his last international tournament, to focus on family. On 13 November 2025, in a 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifier against the Republic of Ireland, Ronaldo received his first senior red card for Portugal (a straight red for elbowing Dara O'Shea during a 0–2 loss), marking a disciplinary first after 225 previous appearances without one.\n\n## Player profile\n\n### Style of play\n\nCristiano Ronaldo's early playing style was characterized by explosive flair, particularly as a winger, where he relied on exceptional dribbling, intricate stepovers, and blistering pace to beat defenders. His top recorded speed reached 33.6 km/h, enabling rapid accelerations that terrorized full-backs in one-on-one situations. Ronaldo has openly cited Brazilian striker Ronaldo Nazário as a major influence on this flamboyant approach, emulating the elder Ronaldo's skillful runs and finishing prowess from his youth.\n\nIn his mid-career phase, particularly during the 2006–07 season at Manchester United, Ronaldo evolved into a more productive creator, excelling in crossing and delivering assists while maintaining his technical wizardry; he topped the Premier League assist charts that year with 12. He also emerged as a free-kick specialist, amassing 64 career free-kick goals through a knuckleball technique that combined power and unpredictability, converting opportunities that many peers could not.\n\nRonaldo's style underwent a significant transformation post-2013 at Real Madrid, shifting from a wide role to a central striker position in a 4-3-3 formation, where he prioritized clinical positioning inside the penalty area over wide runs. This adaptation capitalized on his aerial dominance, with a vertical leap of 78 cm allowing him to outjump opponents for headers, reaching heights of up to 2.93 meters in full jumps. His penalty conversion rate stood at 83.7%, underscoring his composure under pressure from the spot, with 180 successful penalties out of 215 attempts.\n\nCentral to Ronaldo's longevity has been his rigorous physical regimen, incorporating daily gym sessions focused on strength training, high-intensity cardio, and plyometrics, complemented by a diet rich in lean proteins like fish and chicken, whole grains, and vegetables, while avoiding sugary foods and alcohol. This discipline contributed to his exceptional durability, with relatively few major injuries throughout a career spanning over two decades, enabling consistent high-level performance into his late 30s. His versatility allowed seamless transitions across positions, from right winger to left-sided forward and ultimately poacher striker, adapting to tactical demands at clubs like Manchester United, Real Madrid, and Juventus.\n\nDespite these strengths, Ronaldo faced criticism for occasional diving accusations, such as in a 2014 La Liga match against Celta Vigo, where opponents claimed he simulated contact to win a penalty. In his later years, particularly after 2020, his style showed reduced creativity in build-up play, as he focused more on goal-poaching efficiency amid natural declines in speed and dribbling volume.\n\n### Goal celebrations and on-pitch persona\n\nCristiano Ronaldo's goal celebrations have become integral to his on-pitch persona, blending exuberance, emotion, and charisma to connect with fans and teammates throughout his career. Early in his tenure at Manchester United, Ronaldo developed the habit of placing a finger to his ear after scoring, a gesture inviting the crowd to roar louder in support, which he first prominently used around 2008 to amplify the stadium atmosphere. He also frequently jumped over advertising boards to immerse himself among supporters, as seen in matches during his initial United spell, showcasing his flamboyant youth and desire for direct fan interaction.\n\nThe most iconic of Ronaldo's celebrations, the \"Siuuu!\", originated in 2013 during a preseason friendly against Chelsea at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami, where he scored a header and leapt into the air with arms extended, yelling \"Siu\" – a phonetic twist on the Spanish \"sí\" meaning \"yes\" – to express triumph. This mid-air jump and yell evolved into a full spin to display his shirt, and Ronaldo has varied it over time, including a heartwarming instance in 2018 when he shared the gesture with his young son Cristiano Jr. on the pitch following Real Madrid's Champions League victory parade. The celebration has since become a global phenomenon, adopted by fans across sports like tennis at the Australian Open and even non-athletic events such as graduations, symbolizing universal excitement and victory.\n\nRonaldo's on-pitch persona is marked by unyielding confidence, often self-proclaimed as he stated in interviews, \"If I can have the chance to be the best ever, then that would be perfect,\" reflecting his belief in his own greatness that drives his performances. His showmanship shines in moments like shushing opposing crowds after converting penalties, a provocative gesture first notably used as a teenager against Arsenal fans in 2003 and repeated in high-stakes shootouts to assert dominance. As Portugal's long-time captain, Ronaldo exemplifies leadership by motivating teammates from the pitch, such as urging them during critical matches, combining vocal encouragement with exemplary play.\n\nEmotional depth has also defined Ronaldo's expressions, evident in his tears during the Euro 2016 final after a knee injury forced him off the bench early, yet he remained animated, directing players like a coach as Portugal clinched the title in his absence, turning sorrow into collective joy. Upon his 2021 return to Manchester United, Ronaldo displayed frustration through gestures toward the bench during a 2022 match against Brighton, where he reacted visibly to a conceded goal while sidelined, highlighting his intense investment in team success amid limited starts. Over time, Ronaldo's celebrations evolved from the flashy, crowd-engaging antics of his younger years to a more focused, introspective style in his veteran phase, such as dropping to his knees and covering his face after scoring his 900th career goal for Portugal against Croatia on 5 September 2024, conveying quiet reflection on his achievements.\n\n### Rivalry with Lionel Messi\n\nThe rivalry between Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi originated during the 2007–08 UEFA Champions League semi-finals, when Ronaldo's Manchester United faced Messi's Barcelona, marking their first competitive encounters in a high-stakes knockout tie that United won 1–0 on aggregate. This initial clash highlighted their contrasting styles—Ronaldo's athletic prowess and Messi's dribbling finesse—setting the stage for a decade-long competition that intensified after Ronaldo joined Real Madrid in 2009, leading to frequent El Clásico matchups from 2010 to 2018 where they directly opposed each other in La Liga, Copa del Rey, and Champions League fixtures. Their head-to-head record across 36 professional matches shows Messi's teams securing 16 victories to Ronaldo's 11, with 9 draws, while Ronaldo scored 20 goals against Barcelona and Messi netted 26 against Real Madrid, often in pivotal games that underscored their scoring rivalry.\n\nThe duo's competition extended to individual awards, with Ronaldo winning five Ballon d'Or titles (2008, 2013, 2014, 2016, 2017) and Messi claiming eight (2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2015, 2019, 2021, 2023), dominating the award for 13 of the 16 editions from 2008 to 2023 and fueling annual debates over supremacy. In La Liga, they frequently vied for the Pichichi Trophy as top scorers, with Ronaldo winning it twice (2010–11, 2013–14) and Messi four times (2009–10, 2011–12, 2012–13, 2018–19), their prolific outputs—such as Ronaldo's 61 goals in 2014–15 or Messi's 50 in 2011–12—pushing each other to unprecedented seasonal tallies. On the international stage, Portugal and Argentina met five times with Ronaldo and Messi both featuring, resulting in one win each and three draws, including scoreless friendlies in 2011 and 2014; during the 2018 FIFA World Cup, both delivered hat-tricks in group-stage openers, earning mutual respect for their performances despite neither advancing far.\n\nThis rivalry profoundly elevated football's standards, as both players acknowledged \"feeding off each other\" to achieve extraordinary consistency and innovation in goal-scoring and playmaking, inspiring a generation and reshaping the sport's global appeal through heightened competition and viewership. By 2022, amid shifting careers, they exchanged public praise, with Ronaldo stating their competition had \"changed the history of football,\" signaling a transition from rivalry to mutual admiration. As of November 2025, Ronaldo, at Al-Nassr, stands at 953 career goals and pursues the milestone of 1,000, while Messi thrives at Inter Miami, sustaining the ongoing greatest-of-all-time (GOAT) debate that divides fans on metrics like trophies, longevity, and World Cup impact.\n\n## Public image and legacy\n\n### Reception and cultural impact\n\nUpon joining Manchester United in 2003, Cristiano Ronaldo was frequently perceived as a flashy, showboating winger more focused on flair than substance, drawing criticism for his elaborate dribbles and step-overs during the 2003–2006 period. This image persisted amid his early contributions, such as helping United win the FA Cup in 2004, but media outlets often highlighted his perceived immaturity over his potential. However, following his pivotal role in Manchester United's 2008 UEFA Champions League triumph, where he scored the opening goal in the final and finished as top scorer with 42 goals across all competitions that season, Ronaldo's reputation transformed into that of a clutch performer capable of delivering in high-stakes moments.\n\nCriticisms of Ronaldo intensified during his Real Madrid years, particularly around accusations of diving to win penalties and free kicks, as noted in media analyses from 2011 that pointed to instances like his controversial fall against Barcelona. His perceived ego also drew scrutiny, exemplified by 2011–2012 media spats where he publicly expressed frustration over his Ballon d'Or losses and labeled his public image as \"arrogant,\" which he believed hindered his global appeal. Despite this, former manager Sir Alex Ferguson countered such narratives by praising Ronaldo's unparalleled work ethic, recounting how he often had to shout at him to leave the training pitch due to his relentless practice sessions.\n\nRonaldo's cultural impact extends beyond the pitch as a symbol of ambition and self-made success, inspiring global youth through his journey from Madeira's modest roots to football stardom, with his CR7 brand embodying discipline and aspiration via apparel and fitness lines that promote a high-performance lifestyle. He has become the face of football's commercialization, leveraging his image in endorsements that highlight perseverance, influencing a generation to prioritize mental and physical rigor.\n\nMedia portrayals have captured this duality, with the 2015 documentary *Ronaldo* offering an intimate look at his driven persona and family life, though it faced mixed reviews for glossing over controversies. Books like *The Cristiano Ronaldo's Mentality* analyze his mindset of unyielding focus and resilience, drawing from interviews to unpack his approach to setbacks. Ongoing debates in media, particularly the GOAT rivalry with Lionel Messi, have amplified his scrutiny, with Ronaldo recently dismissing claims of Messi's superiority in a 2025 interview, insisting his legacy stands independently.\n\nRonaldo's legacy has transcended sport, solidifying his role in Portugal's national identity after captaining the team to their first major trophy at Euro 2016, where his emotional sideline motivation during the final injury epitomized collective triumph. Similarly, captaining Portugal to victory in the 2025 UEFA Nations League further cemented his status as a symbol of national resilience and success. This victory elevated him as a unifying figure for Portuguese pride, fostering a sense of resilience in the nation's football culture. In 2025 reflections, as he hints at retirement within the next two to three years to prioritize family, Ronaldo has emphasized the emotional weight of leaving the game, predicting he will \"probably cry\" while affirming his enduring influence.\n\n### Popularity and social media influence\n\nCristiano Ronaldo has pioneered social media engagement among athletes, joining Instagram in late 2010 and rapidly building a massive following that positioned him as the most-followed individual on the platform. As of November 2025, his Instagram account boasts over 675 million followers, while his X (formerly Twitter) account exceeds 116 million, contributing to a total of more than 1.1 billion followers across all platforms. This digital dominance reflects his strategic embrace of social media from its early days, transforming it into a core element of his global brand.\n\nHis follower growth has occurred in distinct phases tied to career milestones. Following his 2008 Ballon d'Or win and Manchester United success, Ronaldo's visibility surged amid the rise of platforms like Twitter, laying the foundation for his online presence. The 2016 UEFA European Championship victory further accelerated this, with his trophy-kissing post garnering 3.6 million likes and solidifying his status as social media's top footballer. During his Al-Nassr tenure from 2023 to 2025, he added over 100 million Instagram followers, coinciding with the club's own explosive growth from under 1 million to more than 26 million.\n\nRonaldo's content strategy emphasizes authenticity and variety, featuring intense training videos that showcase his discipline, personal family moments that humanize his life, and subtle endorsements that align with his image. A prime example is his November 2020 Instagram post announcing the birth of his son, which became one of the most-liked posts by an athlete at the time, amassing over 18 million likes and highlighting his ability to blend personal milestones with viral appeal.\n\nHis online influence extends to profound fan engagement, inspiring \"CR7\" chants in stadiums and public spaces worldwide, from European matches to events like the 2025 Times Square gathering where thousands synchronized the calls. Devoted supporters undertake pilgrimages to his native Madeira, drawn to the CR7 Museum as a shrine to his trophies and legacy. Ronaldo's \"Siuuu\" goal celebration has evolved into a global viral meme, remixed in countless videos and trends that amplify his cultural footprint among younger audiences.\n\nIn 2025, despite ongoing discussions about retirement, Ronaldo maintains high engagement levels, sharing motivational content and collaborating with influencers to sustain his digital vitality. Recent interviews reveal his emotional preparation for stepping away from football, yet his posts continue to resonate, underscoring his enduring appeal.\n\n### Philanthropy and eponyms\n\nCristiano Ronaldo has engaged in extensive philanthropic efforts, focusing on children's health, disaster relief, and medical support. In 2014, he donated €1.5 million to a cancer treatment center in Portugal that had previously cared for his mother, funding medical research and patient services. During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Ronaldo and his agent Jorge Mendes contributed €1 million to establish intensive care units in Portuguese hospitals, including equipment for up to 20 patients in Lisbon and additional support in Porto; he also financed five ventilators for healthcare facilities in his native Madeira. These actions highlight his commitment to healthcare infrastructure in times of crisis.\n\nRonaldo has served as a global ambassador for Save the Children since 2013, advocating for child nutrition, education, and protection from hunger and obesity; in this role, he participated in campaigns like #SaveSyriasChildren in 2016 to aid war-affected youth with food, clothing, and medical care. He has also supported other organizations, including UNICEF and World Vision, through endorsements and donations. In 2017, he auctioned a replica of his Ballon d'Or trophy, raising €600,000 for the Make-A-Wish Foundation to grant wishes for children with critical illnesses. Following the 2010 Madeira floods and mudslides that killed over 40 people, Ronaldo organized and participated in a benefit match to aid victims, providing financial and logistical support to his hometown.\n\nRonaldo's philanthropy has drawn some scrutiny, including unsubstantiated claims about donation amounts that were later debunked, such as a reported £5 million contribution to Nepal earthquake relief in 2015, which Save the Children confirmed did not occur. Despite occasional criticism regarding the publicity of his efforts, supporters emphasize their tangible impact, often noting his preference for anonymous contributions to avoid media attention.\n\nSeveral honors and eponyms reflect Ronaldo's societal contributions and global stature. In 2017, Madeira International Airport was renamed Cristiano Ronaldo International Airport to honor his achievements and ties to the island. The Museu CR7, a museum dedicated to his career and trophies, opened in Funchal in 2013, featuring over 100 awards and attracting visitors to showcase his legacy. His CR7 branding extends to the Pestana CR7 hotel chain, launched in partnership with the Pestana Group, with the first property in Funchal emphasizing modern luxury inspired by his persona. Statues erected in his honor include a bronze monument in Funchal's waterfront, unveiled in 2017, depicting his iconic goal celebration, though it faced light-hearted public commentary on its likeness. These tributes underscore his role as a cultural icon from Madeira, with his wealth enabling sustained giving without diminishing his focus on privacy in charitable acts.\n\n## Off-field endeavors\n\n### Business ventures and wealth\n\nCristiano Ronaldo's net worth reached $1.4 billion in October 2025, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, making him the first billionaire footballer. This wealth stems primarily from his career earnings exceeding $1 billion in salaries and endorsements since 2020, as reported by Forbes, supplemented by diverse business investments.\n\nRonaldo launched the CR7 brand in 2013, initially focusing on underwear and fragrances in partnership with JBS Textile Group. The brand expanded into lifestyle products, including the Pestana CR7 hotel chain, which debuted in 2016 and operated five locations by 2025 in cities such as Funchal, Lisbon, New York, Madrid, and Marrakech. In the fitness sector, Ronaldo introduced the Erakulis wellness app in 2024, offering personalized plans for exercise, nutrition, and mental health.\n\nRonaldo's investment portfolio includes significant real estate holdings, such as a luxury mansion in Madrid's La Finca neighborhood purchased during his Real Madrid tenure, properties near Lisbon including his childhood home in Madeira, and a former apartment in New York City's Trump Tower acquired in 2015 for $18.5 million before its sale in 2022. In 2024, he invested in Whoop, a wearable fitness technology company, serving as both investor and global ambassador to co-develop health-tracking products.\n\nAdditional ventures include the Insparya chain of hair restoration clinics, co-founded in 2019 with initial openings in Portugal and Spain, expanding to Riyadh in October 2025. Following his Al-Nassr contract extension in June 2025—valued at approximately $620 million over two years—Ronaldo pursued opportunities in Saudi technology, including the regional rollout of his Whoop partnership and the Insparya clinic launch. His annual earnings from Al-Nassr, estimated at $230 million for the 2025-26 season by Forbes, have further accelerated his wealth accumulation.\n\nRonaldo resolved a Spanish tax evasion case in 2019 by agreeing to an €18.8 million fine and a 23-month suspended prison sentence for undeclared image rights income from 2011 to 2014, avoiding a full trial. This settlement, along with prudent financial oversight, has supported the sustained growth of his business empire.\n\n### Sponsorships and media appearances\n\nCristiano Ronaldo has maintained a lifetime endorsement contract with Nike since 2003, valued at approximately $1 billion by 2025, which includes the development of the CR7 line of football boots and apparel tailored to his playing style. This partnership has significantly boosted Nike's sales, with Ronaldo's social media promotions alone generating $474 million in earned media value for the brand in 2016 through posts across platforms. He has also endorsed other major brands, including Clear shampoo for global hair care campaigns, Herbalife as its nutrition partner since 2013 with multiple renewals, and Binance through a 2022 multi-year agreement focused on non-fungible token (NFT) collections.\n\nRonaldo's endorsement campaigns have often gone viral, amplifying brand visibility. In 2021, during a UEFA Euro press conference, he famously pushed away Coca-Cola bottles—official tournament sponsors—and urged reporters to \"drink water,\" sparking a meme that led to a temporary $4 billion drop in the company's market value while highlighting his influence on consumer perceptions. He serves as a long-term ambassador for Tag Heuer watches, signed in 2014, promoting luxury timepieces through advertisements and limited-edition models inspired by his career. In 2025, Ronaldo became the face of the Saudi Tourism Authority's \"Unreal Calendar\" campaign, promoting the kingdom's sports and cultural events as a global ambassador to attract international visitors.\n\nHis endorsement earnings exceed €50 million annually as of 2025, positioning him as the most marketable footballer and fifth overall among athletes in SportsPro's annual ranking, driven by his massive social media following and cross-cultural appeal. Beyond sponsorships, Ronaldo has engaged in media appearances that extend his commercial reach, including a candid 2022 television interview with Piers Morgan where he discussed his Manchester United tenure, which garnered millions of views and fueled public discourse. He has appeared on the cover of the FIFA video game series, featuring on global editions for FIFA 18 and 19, plus regional variants.\n\nRonaldo has starred in commercials for various products, such as PokerStars' 2015-2017 \"Beat the Clock\" ads, where he portrayed high-stakes poker scenarios to promote the platform's fast-paced tournaments. These endorsements have not been without controversy; his 2022 Binance promotion, involving NFT drops, resulted in a 2023 class-action lawsuit alleging it encouraged investments in an unregistered securities platform, seeking $1 billion in damages from affected users. Despite such issues, Ronaldo's media engagements continue to enhance his status as one of the most commercially influential athletes.\n\n### In popular culture and public art\n\nCristiano Ronaldo has been prominently featured in documentary films that chronicle his life and career. The 2015 film *Ronaldo*, directed by Anthony Wonke, provides an intimate portrait of his journey from humble beginnings in Madeira to global stardom, including behind-the-scenes footage of his family and training regimen. He was animated as a character in the children's series *Striker Force 7*, starting in 2018, a fictionalized depiction of young footballers inspired by real stars like Ronaldo to promote teamwork and perseverance.\n\nPublic art tributes to Ronaldo often highlight his iconic status, though some have sparked controversy. Wax figures of Ronaldo, dressed in his Real Madrid kit, have been displayed at Madame Tussauds locations in London, New York, and Dubai since 2010, capturing his physique and celebratory poses. A bronze bust unveiled at Madeira Airport in 2018 to honor his achievements was widely mocked for its inaccurate likeness, leading to humorous online memes and even a nearby beach named \"Bust Beach\" in jest. In 2021, a similar bust installed in India at a football academy drew criticism for its disproportionate features, prompting Ronaldo to respond lightheartedly on social media. Murals depicting Ronaldo adorn urban spaces, such as a large-scale portrait in Lisbon's Alfama district celebrating his Euro 2016 victory, and another in Manchester's Northern Quarter commemorating his United tenure.\n\nIn 2023, Ronaldo launched NFT collections through partnerships with platforms like Binance, featuring exclusive digital art that remix his career highlights. In Portuguese comics, he inspired the 2019 superhero series *Striker Force 7*, portraying him as a caped crusader battling football villains, blending satire with admiration for his athletic prowess.\n\nBeyond traditional media, Ronaldo appears as a central figure in video games and comics. He serves as a legendary icon in the EA Sports FC series (formerly FIFA), with customizable versions of his playing style featured in career modes and ultimate team editions since 2004. Following Portugal's 2025 UEFA Nations League triumph, new murals of Ronaldo in celebratory poses emerged across Saudi Arabia, including one in Riyadh's Al Rajhi Park symbolizing his Al-Nassr contributions.\n\nRonaldo's cultural footprint includes parodies and stylistic influences. He has been parodied on *Saturday Night Live*, notably in a 2019 sketch where actor Kyle Mooney impersonated his intense training routines and goal celebrations. His evolving hairstyles, from the iconic undercut to slicked-back looks, and visible tattoos like the \"Madeira\" script and lion emblem, have inspired global trends in men's grooming and body art among fans and athletes.\n\n## Personal life\n\n### Family and relationships\n\nCristiano Ronaldo was born to José Dinis Aveiro, a former municipal gardener and kit man who struggled with alcoholism, and Maria Dolores dos Santos Aveiro, a cook and cleaner. His father died in September 2005 at age 51 from liver failure related to alcoholism, when Ronaldo was 20 years old. Ronaldo's mother has faced significant health challenges, including breast cancer diagnosed in 2007, which she overcame after treatment, and a stroke in 2020; she continues to be a central figure in his life despite ongoing health concerns. He has three older siblings: brother Hugo, born in 1975, who pursued football but shifted to supporting Ronaldo's career, including roles in management; and sisters Elma, born in 1973, and Liliana Cátia \"Katia,\" born in 1977, both of whom have been vocal supporters, often defending him publicly and participating in family business ventures.\n\nRonaldo is a father to five living children. His eldest, Cristiano Ronaldo Jr., was born on June 17, 2010, in the United States via a surrogate mother, whose identity Ronaldo has kept private to protect his son's privacy. In June 2017, he welcomed twins Eva Maria and Mateo via surrogacy, also in the United States, maintaining discretion about the process. Later that year, on November 12, 2017, his partner Georgina Rodríguez gave birth to their daughter, Alana Martina. In October 2021, the couple announced they were expecting twins; daughter Bella Esmeralda was born in April 2022, but their son, Angel, was stillborn, an event Ronaldo publicly mourned as a profound loss.\n\nRonaldo's most significant relationship is with Georgina Rodríguez, a Spanish model and former Gucci employee whom he met in 2016 at a Madrid store; they began dating in 2017 and have raised his children together as a blended family of five. The couple got engaged in 2025 after nearly a decade together. Prior to this, Ronaldo dated Russian model Irina Shayk from 2010 to 2015, a five-year relationship that ended amicably and overlapped with the birth of his first child. Ronaldo has consistently emphasized privacy regarding his surrogacy arrangements, rarely discussing details to shield his family from public scrutiny.\n\nThe family has resided in luxury homes across Europe and the Middle East, reflecting Ronaldo's career moves: a mansion in Madrid's La Finca neighborhood during his Real Madrid years, a hillside estate in Turin while at Juventus, a property in Manchester during his Manchester United stint, and currently a sprawling villa in Riyadh since joining Al-Nassr in 2023. In November 2025, Ronaldo hinted at retiring soon to prioritize family time, stating he wanted to focus on his children, particularly following Cristiano Jr., who at age 15 trains at Al-Nassr's youth academy and has debuted for Portugal's under-15 national team. Ronaldo shares a particularly close bond with his mother, often crediting her sacrifices for his success and publicly honoring her on occasions like Mother's Day.\n\n### Health and legal matters\n\nRonaldo underwent laser surgery in 2003 at the age of 15 to treat tachycardia, a congenital heart condition causing his heart to beat abnormally fast even at rest, which threatened to end his budding football career while at Sporting CP's youth academy. He recovered quickly and resumed training within days, with the procedure cauterizing the problematic area to prevent recurrence.\n\nIn 2014, Ronaldo was diagnosed with patellar tendinosis, a chronic knee condition resulting from overuse, which caused ongoing pain and limited his mobility during Real Madrid's successful season. He managed the injury through conservative treatments including rest, physiotherapy, and platelet-rich plasma injections rather than opting for surgery, allowing him to continue performing at an elite level despite the persistent issue. Ronaldo tested positive for COVID-19 in October 2020 while on international duty with Portugal, experiencing mild, asymptomatic symptoms and self-isolating for 14 days before returning to Juventus training. By 2025, at age 40, he demonstrated remarkable fitness by logging 3,599 minutes (as of November 2025) across club and international matches in the calendar year, underscoring his enduring physical condition.\n\nRonaldo maintains his health through a rigorous regimen, including regular cryotherapy sessions to reduce inflammation and accelerate recovery, as well as a polyphasic sleep routine totaling about eight hours daily via multiple 90-minute naps to optimize rest and hormone balance. Despite accumulating over 1,200 professional appearances, he has avoided major long-term injuries, attributing this to proactive fitness monitoring and balanced training that emphasizes prevention over reaction.\n\nIn September 2018, a civil lawsuit was filed alleging Ronaldo raped Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009; the parties had settled privately in 2010 for $375,000 under a non-disclosure agreement. Prosecutors closed the criminal investigation in July 2019 without charges due to insufficient evidence, and the civil case was dismissed in June 2022 after the court ruled the plaintiff's attorney acted in bad faith by using hacked documents. Ronaldo has consistently denied the allegations, maintaining the encounter was consensual.\n\nRonaldo reached a settlement in 2018 with Spanish authorities over tax evasion charges related to image rights income from 2011 to 2014, agreeing to pay a €18.8 million fine and accept a two-year suspended prison sentence, finalized in January 2019. In 2022, he was questioned as part of an Italian probe into Juventus' false accounting practices involving player transfers and salaries, but authorities brought no charges against him personally. By mid-2025, ongoing disputes over deferred wages from his Juventus tenure were partially resolved through arbitration, with further proceedings pending, while he extended his Al-Nassr contract until 2027, settling any club-related negotiation issues.\n\nAmong other legal matters, Ronaldo was fined £50,000 and banned for two matches in November 2022 by the English Football Association for knocking a mobile phone from a young fan's hand after a Manchester United match, an incident he described as regrettable and for which he apologized publicly. He has also pursued privacy lawsuits against media outlets, such as a 2015 action against a Portuguese magazine for publishing unauthorized photos of his young son, emphasizing his commitment to protecting his family's personal life from public exposure.\n\n## Career statistics and records\n\n### Club and international statistics\n\nCristiano Ronaldo's club career spans multiple leagues and clubs, where he has amassed 810 goals in 1,071 appearances, complemented by 244 assists.

He is the only player to have scored 100 or more goals in the Premier League (103), La Liga (311), and Serie A (81), a unique feat underscoring his adaptability across Europe's top leagues. Extending this versatility, Ronaldo became the first player to reach 100 goals for four different clubs—Manchester United (145 total), Real Madrid (450), Juventus (101), and Al-Nassr (109 as of November 2025)—with his century for the Saudi club achieved in just 113 matches at age 40.\n\nRonaldo's milestone achievements include reaching his 100th goal for each major club at distinct points: in 2008 for Manchester United, 2012 for Real Madrid, 2021 for Juventus, and August 2025 for Al-Nassr. He holds the record for the most career hat-tricks with 66, including eight in the Champions League, more than any other player. Additionally, Ronaldo is the fastest player to score 50 goals in La Liga history, accomplishing the feat in 4,518 days during his time at Real Madrid. In 2020, he surpassed Pelé's record for official career goals, reaching 770 to Pelé's 767, a milestone confirmed through verified competitive tallies.\n\nOther notable records include 18 Ballon d'Or nominations, the most of any player, though he was not shortlisted in 2025. Ronaldo has also set benchmarks for longevity, becoming the oldest scorer in UEFA Nations League history at 40 years and 123 days with a goal against Spain in the 2025 final. At Al-Nassr in 2025, he broke his personal non-European league scoring record, netting 83 goals in 85 Saudi Pro League matches, surpassing his 81 in 98 Serie A games for Juventus. These accomplishments highlight Ronaldo's enduring impact, with five Champions League titles—four with Real Madrid and one with Manchester United—further cementing his legacy.\n\n### Honours and awards\n\nCristiano Ronaldo has amassed an extensive collection of team honours across his club career with Sporting CP, Manchester United, Real Madrid, Juventus, and Al-Nassr, alongside international successes with Portugal.\n\n### Club Honours\n\n**Manchester United (2003–2009):** Ronaldo contributed to three Premier League titles (2006–07, 2007–08, 2008–09), one FA Cup (2003–04), two Football League Cups (2005–06, 2008–09), one FA Community Shield (2007), one UEFA Champions League (2007–08), and one FIFA Club World Cup (2008).\n\n**Real Madrid (2009–2018):** During his tenure, he secured two La Liga titles (2011–12, 2016–17), two Copa del Rey trophies (2010–11, 2013–14), two Supercopa de España (2012, 2017), four UEFA Champions League titles (2013–14, 2015–16, 2016–17, 2017–18), two UEFA Super Cups (2014, 2017), and three FIFA Club World Cups (2014, 2016, 2017).\n\n**Juventus (2018–2021):** Ronaldo helped win two Serie A titles (2018–19, 2019–20), one Coppa Italia (2020–21), and two Supercoppa Italiana (2018, 2020).\n\n**Al-Nassr (2023–present):** He has won one Arab Club Champions Cup (2023).\n\n### International Honours\n\nWith Portugal, Ronaldo captained the team to victory in the UEFA European Championship (2016), the inaugural UEFA Nations League (2018–19), and a second UEFA Nations League title (2024–25).\n\n### Individual Awards\n\nRonaldo has received five Ballon d'Or awards (2008, 2013, 2014, 2016, 2017), recognizing him as the world's best player those years.\n\nHe has also earned four European Golden Shoes for being Europe's top scorer (2007–08 with 31 goals, 2010–11 with 40, 2013–14 with 31, and 2014–15 with 48).\n\nAmong other major individual honours, he won three FIFA World Player of the Year/The Best FIFA Men's Player awards (2008, 2016, 2017).\n\nClub-specific accolades include three Pichichi Trophies as La Liga's top scorer (2010–11, 2013–14, 2014–15) and two Capocannoniere awards as Serie A's leading scorer (2018–19 with 21 goals, 2019–20 with 31).\n\nIn 2024–25, Ronaldo again claimed the Saudi Pro League Golden Boot as top scorer.\n\nOverall, Ronaldo has won 35 senior team trophies in his career, highlighted by his record of 61 club goals in the 2014–15 season with Real Madrid.
