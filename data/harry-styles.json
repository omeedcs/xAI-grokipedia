  "content": "# Harry Styles\n\nHarry Edward Styles (born 1 February 1994) is an English singer, songwriter, and actor.  \nHe first achieved global fame as a member of the boy band One Direction, which was assembled during the seventh series of the British television programme *The X Factor* in 2010.  \nOne Direction released five studio albums before entering an indefinite hiatus in 2016.  \nStyles then pursued a solo music career, signing with Columbia Records and issuing his self-titled debut album in 2017, which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart with 230,000 equivalent album units in its first week.  \nSubsequent releases include *Fine Line* (2019) and *Harry's House* (2022), the latter of which earned him the Grammy Awards for Album of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album in 2023.  \nIn film, Styles debuted in Christopher Nolan's *Dunkirk* (2017) and later starred in *Don't Worry Darling* (2022) and *My Policeman* (2022).  \nHis career has been marked by commercial success, with over 15 million equivalent album units sold as a solo artist, and recognition for his eclectic fashion choices and energetic live performances.\n\n## Early life\n\n### Family background and upbringing\n\nHarry Styles was born Harry Edward Styles on 1 February 1994 in Redditch, Worcestershire, England, to Anne Cox (née Selley) and Desmond \"Des\" Styles. His father worked as a sales and marketing consultant based in Cambridgeshire, while his mother held positions including primary school secretary. The family, including Styles' older sister Gemma, relocated to the village of Holmes Chapel in Cheshire during his infancy.\n\nStyles' parents divorced in 2001 when he was seven years old, with his father moving out shortly thereafter. He and Gemma were thereafter raised primarily by their mother in Holmes Chapel, though Styles maintained contact with his father, who occasionally attended his later performances. Reflecting on the divorce in a 2017 interview, Styles stated he had \"blocked it out\" owing to his age but felt consistently loved and supported by both parents.\n\nHis upbringing in the rural Cheshire village emphasized family closeness and everyday routines, with his mother encouraging creative play such as dress-up games that influenced his interest in fashion. As a teenager, Styles took on part-time jobs, including baking at a local shop, reflecting a conventional working-class environment prior to his entertainment career.\n\n### Early interests and education\n\nStyles exhibited an early affinity for music, drawing inspiration from classic rock acts introduced by his parents, including the Beatles, Fleetwood Mac, the Rolling Stones, and Queen. He has cited Freddie Mercury, Elvis Presley, and the Beatles as formative influences, reflecting a childhood engagement with performative singing and songwriting. This interest manifested in local performances, predating his national exposure.\n\nFor formal education, Styles attended Holmes Chapel Comprehensive School in Cheshire, England, a mixed secondary institution where he participated in extracurricular music activities. There, he served as lead singer for the student-formed garage band White Eskimo, alongside three classmates, which secured victory in a regional Battle of the Bands competition around 2009. The band's covers of pop and rock standards underscored Styles' budding showmanship, though he did not complete his secondary studies, departing at age 16 following his 2010 audition for *The X Factor*. Prior to secondary school, he attended Hermitage Primary School in Holmes Chapel.\n\n## One Direction era\n\n### Audition and band formation\n\nHarry Styles auditioned for the seventh series of *The X Factor* UK in 2010 at the age of 16, initially performing Train's \"Hey Soul Sister\" accompanied by guitar before switching to an a cappella rendition of Stevie Wonder's \"Isn't She Lovely\" at the judges' request. Judges Simon Cowell, Louis Walsh, Cheryl Cole, and guest Dannii Minogue praised his charm, curly hair, and vocal potential but noted his rawness as a solo artist, advancing him to the bootcamp stage with reservations about his readiness.\n\nAt bootcamp, Styles failed to progress as a solo contestant after performing an original song, leading producers to categorize him for potential group formation alongside other eliminated male soloists. On July 23, 2010, during the \"groups\" category stage, judge Nicole Scherzinger proposed combining Styles with Niall Horan, Zayn Malik, Liam Payne, and Louis Tomlinson—previously unsuccessful solo acts aged 16 to 18—into a five-member boy band initially named \"One Direction.\"\n\nThe newly formed group, mentored by Simon Cowell in the boys category, debuted with a performance of \"Viva La Vida\" by Coldplay, advancing through the live shows and ultimately finishing in third place behind winner Matt Cardle and runner-up Rebecca Ferguson. Their formation marked the start of Styles' professional career, leveraging the show's platform for immediate post-competition success via Syco Records.\n\n### Global success and key milestones\n\nOne Direction's debut single, \"What Makes You Beautiful,\" released on September 11, 2011, debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart, selling over 153,000 copies in its first week. The track peaked at number four on the US Billboard Hot 100, marking the band's initial breakthrough in the American market with 132,000 digital downloads in its debut week there. \n\nThe group's debut album, *Up All Night*, released on November 21, 2011, in the UK and Ireland, topped the UK Albums Chart and sold 12 million singles, albums, and DVDs worldwide within its first year. Its US release on March 13, 2012, debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 with 176,000 copies sold in the first week, making One Direction the first UK group to achieve a number-one debut album in the US. By late 2012, the album had sold 1.51 million copies in the US alone.\n\nSubsequent releases solidified their international dominance. *Take Me Home* (November 2012) debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, selling over 540,000 copies in its first US week and becoming their second million-selling album that year. *Midnight Memories* (November 2013) also topped the Billboard 200 with 164,000 first-week US sales despite a Thursday release. The Where We Are Tour, supporting *Midnight Memories*, grossed $290 million across 69 stadium shows from 2014 to 2015, drawing 3.4 million attendees and ranking as the highest-grossing tour by a vocal group at the time.\n\nOverall, One Direction sold more than 70 million records worldwide during their active years, with equivalent album sales exceeding 44.5 million units across five studio albums.  Their commercial peak included multiple number-one albums in the UK and US, sold-out world tours, and recognition such as their first Brit Award in 2012 for British Single of the Year.\n\n### Hiatus and individual pursuits\n\nFollowing the release of their fifth studio album *Made in the A.M.* on November 13, 2015, One Direction concluded their On the Road Again Tour with a final performance on October 31, 2015, at Sheffield Arena in England. The band had announced plans for an extended hiatus on August 25, 2015, describing it as a \"well-earned break\" after five years of continuous touring and recording, with no intention of disbanding permanently. This followed Zayn Malik's departure in March 2015, after which the remaining four members—Harry Styles, Niall Horan, Liam Payne, and Louis Tomlinson—completed the album and tour as a quartet. The hiatus became indefinite by January 2016, allowing each member to focus on solo endeavors.\n\nHarry Styles, in particular, shifted toward acting and music preparation during this period. In August 2015, amid the band's announcement, Styles expressed interest in film roles, marking an early pivot from group activities. He was cast as Alex, a young soldier, in Christopher Nolan's World War II film *Dunkirk* on March 11, 2016, beating out thousands of unknowns for the part in a process Nolan likened to high-stakes casting decisions. Principal photography for *Dunkirk* occurred from May to September 2016, providing Styles his screen debut alongside established actors like Tom Hardy and Mark Rylance.\n\nConcurrently, Styles advanced his solo music career by signing a recording contract with Columbia Records on June 23, 2016, the same label that distributed One Direction's work. Deal terms remained undisclosed, but it positioned him to develop material independently, including early studio sessions that would inform his debut solo album. He also planned humanitarian efforts, intending to collaborate with UNICEF on trips to Africa and Asia to support children in need, though specific outcomes from these plans were not publicly detailed at the time.\n\nOther band members similarly pursued solo paths: Niall Horan signed with Capitol Records and released his debut single in 2016; Liam Payne inked deals with Republic Records; Louis Tomlinson began songwriting and television production; and Zayn Malik, having left earlier, issued his solo album *Mind of Mine* in March 2016 under RCA Records. These ventures underscored the hiatus as a deliberate pause for personal and professional growth rather than dissolution.\n\n## Solo music career\n\n### Debut album and initial singles\n\nFollowing the indefinite hiatus of One Direction in 2016, Harry Styles signed a solo recording contract with Columbia Records. His debut solo single, \"Sign of the Times\", was released on April 7, 2017, as the lead single from his self-titled debut album. The track, a six-minute piano-led ballad co-written by Styles with Jeff Bhasker, Tyler Johnson, and Alex Salib, debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart, where it remained for five weeks, and reached number four on the US Billboard Hot 100. It also topped charts in Australia and other markets, accumulating over 366 weeks on various international charts.\n\nStyles' eponymous debut album, *Harry Styles*, was released on May 12, 2017, comprising 10 tracks recorded primarily in Jamaica and Los Angeles with producers including Bhasker and Johnson. The album's tracklist includes: \"Meet Me in the Hallway\", \"Sign of the Times\", \"Carolina\", \"Two Ghosts\", \"Sweet Creature\", \"Only Angel\", \"Kiwi\", \"Ever Since New York\", \"Woman\", and \"From the Dining Table\". \"Sweet Creature\" served as a promotional single on May 2, 2017, ahead of the album's launch, emphasizing acoustic folk elements co-written by Styles and Johnson.\n\nThe album debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart with 57,000 equivalent units in its first week and topped the US Billboard 200 with 193,000 equivalent album units, marking the largest debut week for a UK male artist's solo album in the modern era at that time. By the end of 2017, it had sold over one million copies worldwide, driven by streaming and physical sales. Post-release singles from the album included \"Two Ghosts\" on August 8, 2017, and \"Kiwi\" on October 31, 2017, both of which charted in the UK top 40 and supported the album's rock-oriented sound shift from One Direction's pop style.\n\n### Fine Line and expanded sound\n\nFine Line, the second studio album by Harry Styles, was released on December 13, 2019, by Columbia Records and Erskine Records. Primarily produced by Tyler Johnson and Kid Harpoon (Tom Hull), the record emerged from collaborative sessions where Styles co-wrote most tracks, often starting ideas at home before refining them in studios such as Real World Studios in Wiltshire, England, and Shangri-La in Malibu. The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart, accumulating 478,000 album-equivalent units in its first week, including 393,000 in pure album sales.\n\nPreceded by the lead single \"Lights Up\" on October 11, 2019, Fine Line spawned additional singles including \"Adore You,\" \"Watermelon Sugar\" (which reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 in January 2020), \"Falling,\" and \"Golden.\" Commercially, the album has achieved 3× Platinum certification in the United States by the RIAA for over three million units shipped and 3× Platinum in the United Kingdom by the BPI for exceeding 900,000 units. Globally, it has garnered multi-platinum status in markets such as Italy (2× Platinum for 100,000 units) and Mexico (3× Platinum plus one Diamond equivalent for 210,000 units).\n\nMusically, Fine Line expanded upon the 1970s rock and Beatles-esque folk influences of Styles' self-titled debut by integrating funk, soul, psychedelic pop, and indie elements into a cohesive pop rock framework. Tracks like \"Watermelon Sugar\" evoke 1970s funk grooves with layered guitars and upbeat rhythms, while \"Adore You\" draws on new wave and Laurel Canyon sounds, showcasing greater instrumental diversity and production polish compared to the debut's more straightforward retro aesthetic. This evolution reflected Styles' intent to avoid dilution, blending modern pop structures with classic rock references for a sound described by reviewers as more versatile and personality-driven, though some critiques noted occasional muting of emotional depth. The title track, for instance, uses sparse guitar and introspective lyrics to explore relational tensions, underscoring the album's thematic focus on vulnerability amid sensuality.\n\n### Harry's House and peak commercial phase\n\nHarry Styles released his third studio album, *Harry's House*, on May 20, 2022, through Columbia Records. The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart, earning 521,500 equivalent album units in its first week, including 330,000 pure album sales and marking the largest opening week for a male artist since 2020. It also set a record for the highest vinyl sales in the modern era with 182,000 copies. In the United Kingdom, *Harry's House* became the best-selling album of 2022, accumulating 460,000 chart units, with 160,000 from physical sales.\n\nThe lead single \"As It Was\" topped the Billboard Hot 100 for 15 weeks, becoming Styles' longest-running number-one hit and one of the best-selling singles of the year. All 13 tracks from *Harry's House* charted within the top 30 of the Hot 100 upon release, a feat unmatched by any other artist that week. Subsequent singles like \"Late Night Talking\" and \"Music for a Sushi Restaurant\" also achieved top-10 positions, contributing to the album's sustained chart dominance, including a second week at number one on the Billboard 200.\n\nStyles' *Love on Tour*, which extended into 2022 and 2023 to promote *Harry's House*, grossed over $617 million across 169 shows from 2021 to 2023, with 2022 segments averaging $204.78 per ticket and generating $157.3 million from 44 shows. In 2023, the tour earned $278.6 million from 49 shows, selling 2.4 million tickets and ranking among the year's top-grossing tours. This period marked Styles' commercial zenith, bolstered by the album winning the Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 2023.\n\n### Post-2022 activities and hiatus\n\nStyles extended his *Love on Tour* in support of *Fine Line* (2019) and *Harry's House* (2022) through additional dates announced in January 2023, culminating in the final performance on 22 July 2023 at RCF Arena in Reggio Emilia, Italy. The tour, spanning from September 2021 to July 2023, featured 169 concerts across multiple continents.\n\nFollowing the tour's conclusion, Styles entered an extended hiatus from music releases and large-scale public performances, maintaining a notably low profile thereafter. He made limited appearances, including attending the funeral of his former One Direction bandmate Liam Payne on 20 November 2024 in Wolverhampton, England. Styles did not release new music eligible for the 67th Annual Grammy Awards held on 2 February 2025, nor did he attend the ceremony.\n\nAs of October 2025, no official announcements have been made regarding Styles' fourth studio album or future tours, though unverified reports from industry insiders suggest ongoing work on new material potentially slated for release in 2026. His official website updated its copyright to reference 2025 in August of that year, prompting speculation among fans about an impending return. During this period, Styles has focused on personal endeavors, including reported travel and relationships, while avoiding the intense media scrutiny of prior years.\n\n## Acting career\n\n### Film debut and major roles\n\nStyles made his feature film acting debut in Christopher Nolan's *Dunkirk* (2017), portraying Alex, a Private in the British Expeditionary Force trapped on the Dunkirk beaches during the 1940 evacuation amid the Battle of France. The role marked Styles' transition from music to screen acting, with his character depicted as resourceful yet pragmatic, including a scene where Alex prioritizes survival by contributing to the scuttling of a boat to save others, ultimately escaping to England. Released on July 21, 2017, the film earned $526.9 million worldwide against a $100 million budget.\n\nIn 2021, Styles appeared in a mid-credits sequence of Marvel's *Eternals*, directed by Chloé Zhao, as Eros (also known as Starfox), an Eternal with enhanced abilities and the brother of Thanos, introducing the character alongside ally Pip the Troll to the main storyline involving the Eternals' quest. The brief role, revealed at the film's premiere on October 19, 2021, positioned Styles within the Marvel Cinematic Universe but limited his screen time to the post-credits tease.\n\nStyles expanded to leading parts in 2022. He starred as Jack Chambers in Olivia Wilde's *Don't Worry Darling*, playing the devoted yet enigmatic husband to Florence Pugh's Alice in a seemingly idyllic 1950s company town concealing psychological horrors; the thriller premiered at the Venice Film Festival on September 5 and was released theatrically on September 23.  That year, he also led as Tom Burgess in *My Policeman*, directed by Michael Grandage, embodying a 1950s Brighton policeman entangled in a clandestine same-sex affair with a museum curator (David Dawson) while courting schoolteacher Marion Taylor (Emma Corrin), framed by dual timelines exploring regret and societal repression under Britain's homosexuality laws. The drama world-premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 13 and streamed on Amazon Prime Video from November 4. No major film roles followed through 2025, though Styles pursued select projects amid his music commitments.\n\n### Critical reception and acting style\n\nHarry Styles' acting debut in Christopher Nolan's *Dunkirk* (2017) received positive notices, with critics praising his ability to blend seamlessly into the ensemble without drawing undue attention to his celebrity status. Reviewers highlighted his conveyance of grit and pathos as the character Alex, a young soldier, noting that Styles demonstrated authentic emotional depth despite limited screen time and dialogue. \n\nSubsequent lead roles in *Don't Worry Darling* (2022) and *My Policeman* (2022) drew sharper criticism, with a consensus that Styles struggled to sustain nuanced performances, often appearing awkward or emotionally flat. In *Don't Worry Darling*, directed by Olivia Wilde, Styles' portrayal of Jack was described as halting dramatic scenes and failing to embody an \"everyman\" convincingly, with audiences reportedly laughing during screenings and reviewers citing his inexperience as a drag on the film's tension.   Similarly, in *My Policeman*, his depiction of policeman Tom Burgess was faulted for blandness and lack of conviction in a melodramatic love triangle, contributing to the film's 45% Rotten Tomatoes score and descriptors like \"arrestingly awkward\" from outlets assessing its period drama execution.  \n\nStyles' acting style has been characterized as reliant on natural charisma and physical presence rather than technical versatility, with observers noting his comfort on camera but limited range in conveying complex inner turmoil. Critics argue this stems from his pop star background, where performative allure overshadows subtler dramatic demands, leading to performances that prioritize surface appeal over depth—evident in self-admitted uncertainty about the craft, as Styles stated in 2022 interviews that he approaches acting with \"no idea what I'm doing.\"   While some defend his potential in supporting roles, the prevailing view holds that lead demands expose shortcomings in emotional layering and scene partnership.\n\n## Artistry\n\n### Musical influences and style evolution\n\nHarry Styles' musical influences stem from classic rock acts introduced via his parents' record collections, including Fleetwood Mac, the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, and Pink Floyd. He has frequently cited David Bowie for his genre-blending experimentation, Paul McCartney for melodic songcraft, Joni Mitchell for introspective lyricism, and Stevie Nicks for emotive delivery as pivotal inspirations shaping his artistic outlook.\n\nDuring his tenure with One Direction from 2010 to 2015, Styles contributed to a pop framework infused with rock elements, co-writing 21 of the band's 86 songs across five albums, emphasizing anthemic hooks produced by collaborators like Ed Sheeran and Ryan Tedder. Launching his solo career with the eponymous *Harry Styles* album on May 12, 2017, he pivoted to a rock-centric sound dominated by piano-driven ballads and electric guitar riffs, as evident in the lead single \"Sign of the Times,\" a six-minute epic reflecting 1970s rock grandeur.\n\nThe 2019 album *Fine Line*, released December 13, broadened this foundation into versatile rock anthems and folk-infused ballads, drawing from 1970s power pop, Laurel Canyon singer-songwriter traditions, and McCartney's influence on tracks like the title song; it yielded the Grammy-winning \"Watermelon Sugar,\" which reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 on November 9, 2020. With *Harry's House* on May 20, 2022, Styles incorporated funky bass lines, electronic beats, and synth elements alongside pop and R\\u0026B flourishes, prioritizing playful introspection over overt rock homage; the single \"As It Was\" topped the Billboard Hot 100 for 15 consecutive weeks starting May 28, 2022, marking his longest-charting hit. This progression reflects a deliberate maturation from boy-band pop constraints to an eclectic, self-authored palette prioritizing personal sonic preferences over commercial formulas.\n\n### Songwriting and vocal technique\n\nHarry Styles co-writes the majority of his solo material, often collaborating with producers Kid Harpoon (Tom Hull) and Tyler Johnson, who contribute to both lyrics and production. For his 2022 album *Harry's House*, five of its 13 tracks were credited solely to Styles, Hull, and Johnson, reflecting a core songwriting trio that emphasizes iterative sessions blending personal anecdotes with genre influences like 1970s rock and pop. His songwriting process involves drawing from lived experiences, as seen in tracks like \"As It Was,\" co-written with the same partners during focused studio work that prioritizes emotional resonance over rigid structures. \n\nStyles' lyrics frequently explore themes of love, longing, loss, and self-reflection, presented in a relatable yet ambiguous manner that avoids explicit narrative resolution, allowing broad interpretive appeal. This approach stems from his integration of diverse musical inspirations, including classic rock and soul, into pop frameworks, as evidenced by his consistent writing credits across albums like *Fine Line* (2019) and *Harry's House*, where he adapts personal vulnerability into universal motifs without relying on ghostwriters. Industry practices sometimes inflate credits for promotional leverage, but Styles' documented involvement in sessions counters claims of minimal input, with his contributions verified through production diaries and co-writer accounts.\n\nAs a lyric baritone, Styles possesses a vocal range spanning approximately A2 to D5 in studio recordings, extending to falsetto notes up to C6 in live settings, enabling a versatile delivery across chest voice, mixed belt, and head voice registers.  His technique relies on natural vibrato and falsetto for emotional highs, particularly in ballads like \"Sign of the Times\" (2017), though live performances occasionally reveal strain on sustained high notes due to emphasis on stylistic phrasing over technical precision.  Without formal vocal training publicized, his development appears driven by repetitive touring and studio refinement, yielding a darker timbre suited to rock-inflected pop rather than operatic extension. This baritonal foundation supports his shift from One Direction's higher harmonies to solo leads, prioritizing interpretive expressiveness over expansive range feats.\n\n### Live performances and stagecraft\n\nHarry Styles' solo live performances emphasize a rock-oriented stage presence, drawing from glam and classic influences through full-band arrangements and dynamic visuals. His debut solo tour, Harry Styles: Live on Tour (2017–2018), incorporated elaborate production elements including moving LED screens, automated lighting trusses, a custom main stage, and a B-stage extension for intimate fan interactions during select songs. The tour spanned 89 dates across North America, Europe, Asia, Australia, and South America, showcasing tracks from his self-titled debut album alongside covers like One Direction's \"Stockholm Syndrome.\" Reviews highlighted Styles' vocal prowess surpassing studio recordings and his energetic delivery, with audiences responding to the rock-star aesthetics amid predominantly female crowds.\n\nThe subsequent Love on Tour (2021–2023), supporting *Fine Line* and *Harry's House*, escalated in scale with 169 shows across four continents, grossing $617.3 million and attracting over 5 million attendees, marking it as the fourth highest-grossing tour ever reported. Production featured video effects via multiple cameras to spotlight the live band, large-scale rigging with custom winches for dynamic set pieces, and extended catwalks enabling Styles to traverse arenas and stadiums for closer engagement. Setlists blended upbeat tracks like \"Golden\" and \"Watermelon Sugar\" with ballads, often closing with \"Sign of the Times\" accompanied by fireworks at select stadium dates. Styles employed frequent costume changes—featuring fringe jackets, sequined ensembles, and vibrant patterns—reinforcing a retro-glam aesthetic while maintaining high-energy movement across the stage.\n\nStyles' stagecraft prioritizes audience immersion, with confetti cannons, synchronized lighting, and horn sections augmenting the live instrumentation of guitar, drums, and keyboards to replicate album textures. Extended residencies in cities like New York and London allowed setlist variations and fan-centric moments, such as gender reveal announcements, fostering a communal atmosphere. Critics noted the tours' uplifting tone and Styles' swagger, though some observed the productions' reliance on visual spectacle to sustain pop-rock energy amid vocal demands. The band's setup, including DPA-mic'd drums for precise front-of-house mix, supported powerful dynamics suited to arena environments. Overall, these elements contributed to record-breaking attendance, including 335,000 tickets sold across four Wembley Stadium shows in June 2023, grossing $36.4 million.\n\n## Fashion and public persona\n\n### Style development and commercial branding\n\nHarry Styles' fashion style originated in his One Direction era, beginning with the band's formation on *The X Factor* in 2010, where he favored casual attire such as Jack Wills hoodies and Topman chinos paired with fitted jeans and suede boots. By 2012, his looks incorporated blazers, marking an early shift toward more structured menswear. This evolved into bolder choices by 2013, exemplified by his attendance at Burberry's Spring/Summer 2014 show on September 16, introducing elements like patterned shirts that foreshadowed later flamboyance.\n\nA pivotal development occurred in 2015 at the American Music Awards, where Styles wore a floral embroidered suit, signaling a departure from conventional boy band aesthetics toward rock-inspired eccentricity. Following One Direction's hiatus in 2016, his solo debut in 2017 aligned with increased experimentation, including pussy-bow blouses, pink suits, and stacked heels, often sourced from Gucci under creative director Alessandro Michele. This phase emphasized layered, vintage-infused menswear blended with feminine-leaning pieces, such as sheer shirts and bold prints.\n\nCommercially, Styles solidified his branding through high-profile Gucci partnerships starting in 2018, featuring in the Men's Tailoring Cruise 2019 campaign shot at Villa Lante, Rome, which portrayed him in tailored suits with playful elements like fish and chips shop motifs in prior ads. He deepened this alliance in June 2022 by co-designing the \"Gucci HA HA HA\" collection, a '70s-inspired menswear line with embroidered motifs and exaggerated silhouettes, marketed via campaigns emphasizing emotional expressivity. In November 2021, Styles launched his own brand, Pleasing, initially with clean nail polishes in ten shades, expanding to skincare and later sexual wellness products by 2025, positioning it as an accessible counterpart to luxury collaborations. This dual strategy—luxury endorsements alongside affordable direct-to-consumer lines—broadened his commercial reach across demographics.\n\n### Impact on gender norms and cultural debates\n\nHarry Styles' public embrace of clothing traditionally associated with women, including skirts, pearl necklaces, and dresses, has fueled ongoing discussions about gender norms in fashion. In December 2020, he became the first solo male to appear on the cover of U.S. *Vogue* wearing a Gucci ball gown paired with a pearl necklace, a styling choice that positioned him as a proponent of gender-neutral aesthetics. Styles has articulated a philosophy against confining apparel to binary gender categories, stating in a 2019 *Vogue* interview that he finds it \"stimulating\" to eschew such parameters. His earlier adoption of feminine elements, such as a pearl necklace at the 2019 Fine Arts Theatre premiere, similarly drew attention for blurring conventional masculine presentation.\n\nThese choices ignited cultural debates, particularly around masculinity and societal expectations. Conservative critics, including commentator Candace Owens, responded to the *Vogue* cover by tweeting calls to \"bring back manly men,\" framing Styles' attire as symptomatic of eroding traditional male roles. Ben Shapiro echoed this, decrying the \"feminizing of masculinity\" and attributing the coverage to broader cultural shifts. In contrast, progressive outlets and figures like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez interpreted backlash as rooted in critics' insecurities about evolving norms, with AOC tweeting that Styles' dress provoked anger due to threats to rigid gender constructs. Styles defended his approach in a December 2020 *Variety* interview, expressing no regret over the styling and emphasizing personal freedom in expression.\n\nDebates also emerged within queer communities, highlighting tensions over representation and privilege. Actor Billy Porter, known for his own gender-nonconforming fashion, criticized the *Vogue* cover in 2023, arguing Styles secured it due to being \"white and straight,\" sidelining black queer trailblazers who faced greater barriers. Some online discourse questioned whether Styles' celebrity status enabled risk-free experimentation unavailable to average men, with one analysis noting that while high-profile figures like him can \"rock a skirt\" on red carpets, ordinary individuals risk social stigma in everyday settings.\n\nAssessments of broader impact vary, with fashion analysts crediting Styles for influencing Gen Z perceptions of brands through gender-fluid collaborations, such as his Gucci campaigns. However, quantifiable shifts in male fashion adoption or norm erosion lack robust empirical support beyond anecdotal trends, as mainstream media coverage often amplifies symbolic gestures over causal evidence of societal change. Critics from varied ideological camps argue his influence reinforces elite exceptionalism rather than democratizing attire choices, perpetuating debates on authenticity versus performative boundary-pushing.\n\n## Personal life\n\n### Relationships and dating history\n\nHarry Styles has historically kept details of his romantic life private, emphasizing in interviews that he prefers not to discuss personal relationships publicly to avoid fueling speculation. His confirmed or strongly evidenced partnerships, drawn from consistent media reports of sightings, mutual acquaintances, and occasional references by involved parties, span several years and involve prominent figures in entertainment and modeling.\n\nIn late 2011, shortly after One Direction's formation on *The X Factor*, Styles began dating British television host Caroline Flack, who was a judge on the show; the relationship, marked by their 15-year age gap (Styles was 17, Flack 31), lasted until early 2012 and ended amid intense tabloid scrutiny.\n\nStyles dated American singer Taylor Swift from late 2012 to January 2013; they were first linked in March 2012 following mutual industry connections, vacationed together in the British Virgin Islands in December 2012, and split after reported tensions during a ski trip.\n\nBetween 2013 and 2016, Styles was involved in an on-and-off relationship with model Kendall Jenner, with public sightings including horseback riding in 2014 and a ski outing in 2016; while neither confirmed exclusivity, Jenner's sister Khloé Kardashian described their time together as \"dating\" in 2016 comments to media.\n\nStyles dated French model Camille Rowe from mid-2017 to July 2018; they met through a mutual friend, were photographed on multiple dates including in Los Angeles and London, and Rowe accompanied him to events like his sister's graduation in December 2017 before their reported split following his tour.\n\nIn January 2021, Styles began a relationship with actress and director Olivia Wilde, whom he met while filming *Don't Worry Darling*; they were publicly affectionate at events like the Venice Film Festival in September 2021 and split in November 2022, with sources citing demanding schedules as a factor.\n\nAs of October 2025, Styles has been romantically linked to actress Zoë Kravitz, with sightings together in Rome in August 2025 and reports of them advancing the connection through shared travel and meetings with each other's circles, though no direct confirmation from either party has occurred.\n\n### Sexuality and public statements\n\nHarry Styles has been romantically linked exclusively to women in public reports, including relationships with Taylor Swift from late 2012 to early 2013, Kendall Jenner intermittently from 2013 to 2016, Camille Rowe from 2017 to 2018, and Olivia Wilde from January 2021 to November 2022. These associations, confirmed through media coverage of joint appearances and statements from involved parties, contrast with persistent speculation about same-sex attractions fueled by his fashion choices and ambiguous public persona, though no verified evidence of such relationships exists.\n\nIn a December 2019 *Guardian* interview, Styles rejected notions of deliberate sexual ambiguity in his image, stating, \"Am I sprinkling in nuggets of sexual ambiguity to try and be more interesting? No.\" He framed his clothing selections—such as dresses and gender-nonconforming attire—as driven by aesthetics rather than orientation signaling: \"Not because it makes me look gay, or it makes me look straight, or it makes me look bisexual, but because I think it looks cool.\" On sexuality itself, he remarked, \"I think sexuality’s something that’s fun. Honestly? I can’t say I’ve given it any more thought than that,\" emphasizing a casual, non-committal stance without labels.\n\nStyles reiterated privacy in an August 2022 *Rolling Stone* interview, describing sexuality as a personal process: \"I think everyone, including myself, has your own journey with figuring out sexuality and getting more comfortable with it.\" He disputed claims of limited public dating history by noting, \"Sometimes people say, 'You've only publicly been with women,' and I don’t think I’ve publicly been with anyone,\" prioritizing discretion to shield relationships from scrutiny. Addressing queerbaiting allegations—critics accusing him of exploiting queer aesthetics for appeal without authentic identification—he stated that while flattered by fans' projections, \"What I do is art... different people define queer differently,\" avoiding self-definition and underscoring experiential variance over public categorization.\n\n### Health, fitness, and lifestyle\n\nHarry Styles maintains a rigorous fitness regimen tailored for endurance and performance during tours and personal challenges, training under personal trainer Thibo David. His routine emphasizes cardiovascular conditioning and bodyweight strength, beginning with a 20-30 minute warm-up jog followed by a one-mile sprint, which he completes in under five minutes.  He incorporates an eight-minute challenge consisting of 100 push-ups, 100 sit-ups, and 100 squats, alongside hill sprints, core exercises, Pilates, yoga for mobility, and occasional swimming or longer runs up to 18 kilometers.   Additional elements include kettlebell swings, jumping lunges, tuck jumps, and ice baths for recovery.  This approach supported his completion of the 2025 Berlin Marathon on September 21 under the pseudonym Sted Sarandos, finishing in 2 hours, 59 minutes, and 13 seconds—a sub-three-hour time marking significant running prowess for a non-professional athlete. \n\nStyles follows a pescatarian diet since 2017, abstaining from meat but including fish, a shift prompted by positive experiences with vegan meals prepared by bandmates during touring. He publicly affirmed avoiding meat to audiences, as stated during a 2022 concert. Periodically, he undertakes six-day juice cleanses prior to photoshoots or high-visibility events to optimize physique. His eating habits align with managing gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), incorporating an acid-reflux-conscious regimen that excludes triggers like coffee. \n\nIn lifestyle practices, Styles prioritizes recovery and wellness, aiming for 10 hours of sleep nightly during tours, supplemented by two humidifiers in his room and intravenous (IV) nutrient and vitamin infusions to sustain energy and counteract touring demands.  He incorporates daily meditation, often in the morning alongside coffee on non-tour days, and stresses hydration and balanced nutrition as foundational to his preparation.  No major chronic health conditions beyond GERD have been publicly disclosed, with his habits reflecting a disciplined approach to physical and mental resilience amid a high-performance career.\n\n## Philanthropy and advocacy\n\n### Key initiatives and campaigns\n\nStyles has channeled proceeds from his concert tours into charitable fundraisers targeting multiple global causes. His 2018 solo world tour generated $1.2 million, distributed among 62 nonprofit organizations focused on issues such as child welfare, environmental protection, and LGBTQ+ rights. The subsequent Love on Tour, spanning 2021 to 2023 with 173 shows across 32 countries, raised over $6.5 million, which Styles donated to entities including Save the Children for child aid, Planned Parenthood for reproductive health services, Choose Love for refugee support, and the ACLU for civil liberties advocacy.\n\nIn 2022, Styles launched his gender-neutral nail polish brand Pleasing, incorporating a philanthropic component through the \"Do Better\" initiative in partnership with the nonprofit Nest. This program allocates funds to support artisan cooperatives led by women in developing regions, aiming to promote economic empowerment and sustainable livelihoods via fair-trade practices.\n\nStyles has also made targeted donations tied to specific causes. In June 2020, he contributed to bail funds for Black Lives Matter protesters arrested during demonstrations against police violence. Additionally, he donated royalties from the licensing of his song \"Treat People With Kindness\" for Marks \\u0026 Spencer's 2022 Christmas advertisement to Centrepoint, a UK charity addressing youth homelessness. These efforts align with his public slogan \"Treat People With Kindness,\" originally a guitar strap message from his 2018 tour that evolved into a broader ethos of empathy and action, though not formalized as a standalone campaign.\n\n### Effectiveness and criticisms\n\nStyles' \"Love on Tour\" from 2021 to 2023 generated over $6.5 million in donations to more than 25 charities worldwide, including organizations focused on reproductive health, environmental protection, gun safety, and humanitarian aid such as Planned Parenthood, Everytown for Gun Safety, and Choose Love.  His earlier 2018 solo tour raised $1.2 million for 62 local nonprofits addressing issues like migration and social challenges in tour cities.  Partnerships with REVERB for the GEM sustainability initiative eliminated over 33,900 single-use plastic bottles across shows through refill stations and reduced backstage waste, contributing to lower tour emissions. Voter registration drives tied to the tour registered more than 54,000 individuals via collaborations with nonprofits.\n\nTreat People With Kindness merchandise sales have funneled proceeds to causes including the World Health Organization's COVID-19 fund and Time's Up Legal Defense Fund, with specific donations like $42,000 to the latter in 2018. These efforts demonstrate direct financial transfers and operational changes, such as waste reduction, but lack independent audits on long-term outcomes like sustained charity program efficacy or measurable policy shifts from advocacy.\n\nCritics have questioned the depth of Styles' philanthropy, arguing it prioritizes high-visibility donations over systemic change, with selections like Planned Parenthood drawing partisan scrutiny for aligning with progressive causes amid broader debates on their operational impacts. Some queer advocates contend his support for LGBTQ+ initiatives appears inconsistent or superficial, potentially funneling funds to organizations with mixed records on community issues, though evidence remains anecdotal rather than data-driven.  His avoidance of explicit political endorsements has been praised for broadening appeal but criticized as evasive, limiting potential for galvanizing advocacy beyond financial contributions. Overall, while donation volumes are substantial, the absence of rigorous impact evaluations—common in celebrity giving—raises questions about causal effectiveness versus publicity gains.\n\n## Controversies and criticisms\n\n### Queerbaiting allegations and fashion backlash\n\nHarry Styles has faced allegations of queerbaiting, defined as the practice of suggesting queer identity or relationships through aesthetics and marketing to appeal to LGBTQ+ audiences without authentic commitment. Critics, particularly within online queer communities, have pointed to his gender-nonconforming fashion choices, such as pearl necklaces and skirts, alongside ambiguous statements on sexuality, as evidence of exploiting queer imagery for commercial gain while publicly dating women like Taylor Swift and Olivia Wilde. These claims intensified around his 2022 role in *My Policeman*, where he portrayed a gay character, with some accusing him of using the project to deflect scrutiny over his personal life.\n\nIn response, Styles emphasized privacy, stating in an August 2022 Variety interview, \"Sometimes people say, 'You've only publicly been with women,' and I don't think I've publicly been with anyone.\" He rejected labels, noting in 2017 that he saw no need to define his sexuality for public consumption. Singer Adam Lambert, openly gay, dismissed the accusations as insulting to queer performers, arguing they wrongly police straight artists' expressions of fluidity and that such claims undermine genuine queer artistry by implying exclusionary gatekeeping. No empirical evidence, such as confirmed same-sex relationships or explicit marketing deceptions, substantiates intentional baiting; the allegations rely on interpretive readings of style and evasion of binary categories.\n\nStyles' fashion, including feminine garments, has drawn separate backlash from conservative figures concerned with eroding traditional masculinity. In November 2020, his Vogue cover featuring a blue Gucci dress paired with a tuxedo jacket elicited criticism from commentator Candace Owens, who tweeted on November 15, 2020, \"There is no society of pretty boys/girls that can last. To be a pretty boy or girl is already to be a member of a privileged elite. Bring back manly men.\" Similar reactions recurred during his October 2021 Harryween concert, where he wore a dress, prompting renewed debates on gender norms.\n\nProgressive critics, including actor Billy Porter, argued the Vogue shoot marginalized Black queer men by centering a straight white celebrity in spaces historically denied to non-cisgender individuals. Porter stated in November 2020 that Styles' dress \"doesn't speak to breaking down the binary\" but rather appropriates queer expression without addressing systemic exclusion. Styles countered in a December 2020 Variety interview that restricting clothing by gender \"shuts out a whole world of great clothes,\" framing his choices as personal liberation rather than political statement. These responses highlight causal tensions: conservative pushback stems from perceived threats to sex-based roles, while queer critiques reflect intra-community competitions over representational authenticity, though Styles' consistent dating patterns and lack of queer identification undermine claims of performative deception.\n\n### Relationship scandals and personal conduct\n\nIn late 2011, Harry Styles began a brief romantic relationship with British television presenter Caroline Flack, whom he met while competing on *The X Factor*, where she served as a host. At the time, Styles was 17 years old and Flack was 31, drawing significant media scrutiny and public criticism over the 14-year age disparity and perceived power imbalance, as Flack held a mentorship role in his early career. The couple confirmed the relationship publicly but ended it mutually in January 2012, citing intense media pressure as a factor. Flack later reflected on the pairing as \"strange\" amid ongoing tabloid attention, though no legal issues arose, given the UK's age of consent at 16.\n\nStyles was also linked to married DJ Lucy Horobin in 2011, shortly after his *X Factor* appearance, with reports of the two being spotted together sparking a minor scandal due to her marital status at the time. Details remain limited and unconfirmed beyond contemporaneous tabloid accounts, with no further public developments or statements from Styles.\n\nFrom 2021 to 2022, Styles dated actress and director Olivia Wilde, who cast him as the lead in her film *Don't Worry Darling*. Their relationship, which became public in January 2021 via hand-holding photos, fueled speculation of an on-set affair, as Wilde was still engaged to actor Jason Sudeikis when filming began in 2020; Sudeikis reportedly learned of the involvement indirectly, contributing to their subsequent split. The 10-year age gap (Wilde 37, Styles 27) drew some commentary, though less intense than prior cases, and the pair parted amicably without acrimony from Styles' side.\n\nRegarding personal conduct, Styles has maintained a relatively low-profile image with no verified reports of legal troubles, substance abuse arrests, or violent incidents. Early rumors tied him to brief, unverified encounters, but these lack substantiation beyond gossip columns. He has faced fan obsession, including a 2024 stalking conviction involving over 8,000 cards sent to his home in under a month, underscoring boundaries in celebrity interactions rather than reflecting on his behavior. Critics have occasionally questioned the authenticity of his public persona in fan engagements, describing them as performative rather than genuine, though such views stem from opinion pieces rather than empirical evidence of misconduct.\n\n### Professional disputes and industry backlash\n\nIn the years following One Direction's indefinite hiatus in 2016, Styles maintained public statements emphasizing camaraderie with his former bandmates, asserting in a December 2020 interview that external narratives often pitted them \"against each other\" despite their shared affection for the group. However, Louis Tomlinson, another ex-member, acknowledged underlying professional envy in a November 2022 discussion, admitting that Styles' rapid solo ascent \"bother[ed]\" him initially, though he viewed Styles as a brother and credited the band's collective foundation for individual successes. Tomlinson reiterated in February 2023 that early \"envy\" over Styles' trajectory had dissipated, attributing it to differential promotional support post-hiatus, while affirming ongoing friendship as of June 2025. Zayn Malik, who departed the band in 2015, similarly distanced himself in a 2017 statement, claiming limited personal closeness to Styles amid fan perceptions of tighter bonds.\n\nA notable collaborator dispute emerged in April 2022 when the indie duo Lucius publicly contested their lack of featured artist billing on Styles' 2019 track \"Treat People With Kindness\" from the album *Fine Line*, despite providing the song's opening vocals and every chorus. Lucius members Jess Wolfe and Holly Laessig described the contributions—recorded during band sessions—as integral, arguing in interviews that industry norms warranted co-feature status given the prominence, yet they received only liner note acknowledgments without royalties or billing adjustments. Styles' team did not publicly respond, prompting online criticism highlighting the irony against the song's thematic plea for kindness and raising questions about equity in high-profile production credits.\n\nStyles faced industry-wide scrutiny after winning Album of the Year for *Harry's House* at the 65th Grammy Awards on February 5, 2023, with his acceptance speech remark—\"This doesn't happen to people like me very often\"—drawing accusations of insensitivity from observers who noted his status as a white, cisgender male in a historically white-male-favoring Academy. The comment, intended to underscore rarity for his pop persona, fueled debates on social media and outlets about privilege and the Recording Academy's patterns, especially as competitors like Beyoncé's *Renaissance* were overlooked for the top prize despite critical acclaim. Critics argued the win exemplified overhyped commercial appeal over artistic merit, amplifying preexisting skepticism toward Styles' Grammy trajectory amid One Direction's limited prior nominations.\n\n## Commercial success and legacy\n\n### Sales figures, charts, and awards\n\nHarry Styles' solo albums have collectively generated substantial sales, with equivalent album units exceeding 36 million worldwide as of October 2025. In the United States alone, his catalog has amassed nearly 12 million album units by early 2025. His debut self-titled album, *Harry Styles* (2017), achieved 2x Platinum certification from the RIAA for 2 million units shipped in the US and topped the Billboard 200 chart upon release. *Fine Line* (2019), his highest-selling release, has reached 15 million equivalent units globally, including multi-platinum status in multiple markets, though pure sales constitute about 1.9 million copies. *Harry's House* (2022) debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 with 521,500 equivalent units in its first week, driven partly by 182,000 vinyl sales—the largest weekly vinyl debut for any album that year—and has since earned multi-platinum certifications.\n\n| Album | Global Equivalent Units (approx.) | US Certification (RIAA) | Billboard 200 Peak |\n|-------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------|\n| *Harry Styles* (2017) | 5+ million | 2x Platinum | #1 |\n| *Fine Line* (2019) | 15 million | 3x Platinum | #1 |\n| *Harry's House* (2022) | 12+ million | 2x Platinum | #1 (multiple weeks) |\n\nOn the singles front, Styles has secured two number-one hits on the Billboard Hot 100: \"Watermelon Sugar\" from *Fine Line*, which topped the chart for one week in 2020 after a remix featuring Kid Harpoon, and \"As It Was\" from *Harry's House*, which held the top position for a record 15 weeks—the longest reign by any song from a British artist and the longest for a solo male artist in Hot 100 history. \"As It Was\" has sold over 10 million units in the US, earning Diamond certification potential, while the entire *Harry's House* tracklist charted in the Hot 100's top 30 upon release, a rare feat underscoring strong streaming and sales momentum. Other singles like \"Adore You\" and \"Sign of the Times\" peaked in the top 10 and top 20, respectively, contributing to certifications including multi-platinum for several tracks via the RIAA.\n\nStyles has garnered numerous accolades reflecting his commercial achievements, including three Grammy Awards: Album of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album for *Harry's House* at the 65th Annual Grammy Awards in 2023, alongside nominations for Record of the Year and Song of the Year for \"As It Was.\" He holds six Brit Awards, such as British Artist of the Year (2023) and multiple for his albums and singles, along with three American Music Awards for Favorite Pop Artist and Favorite Pop Album. Additional honors include Ivor Novello Awards for songwriting and MTV Video Music Awards for videos like \"Adore You.\" These awards, drawn from industry bodies like the Recording Academy and BPI, affirm his sales-driven impact, though Grammy wins have occasionally sparked debate over voter preferences favoring mainstream pop metrics.\n\n### Economic impact and business ventures\n\nHarry Styles launched Pleasing, a unisex beauty and lifestyle brand, in November 2021, initially offering vegan nail polishes, cuticle oil, and skincare products priced between $20 and $75. The brand expanded to include fragrances and eye gels by 2023 under new CEO Shaun Kearney, targeting a market where male celebrity grooming lines have gained traction. Specific sales figures for Pleasing remain undisclosed, though it operates direct-to-consumer and aligns with Styles' emphasis on gender-neutral products.\n\nIn addition to Pleasing, Styles has pursued investments as an angel investor, including a stake in fashion brand S.S. Daley announced on January 11, 2024, focusing on consumer and healthtech sectors. He maintains Erskine Records, his independent label imprint under Columbia Records, which has facilitated releases like his solo albums since 2016, though detailed financial outputs from the label are not publicly reported. Endorsement deals have supplemented his ventures, notably with Gucci for apparel campaigns since 2018 and Apple for promotional features, contributing to diversified revenue streams beyond music.\n\nStyles' *Love on Tour* (2021–2023) generated $617.3 million in gross revenue across 169 shows, selling over 5 million tickets with an average per-show gross of $3.65 million, marking it as the fourth-highest-grossing tour ever reported to Billboard Boxscore. This concert activity, alongside merchandise sales through official stores offering items like tour-specific apparel, amplified economic effects in live music, including contributions to UK music tourism valued at £8.6 billion in 2023, where Styles' stadium performances drew significant attendance. His ventures and tours have thus driven substantial revenue, supporting jobs in production, retail, and hospitality, though precise macroeconomic multipliers require broader industry analysis.\n\n### Long-term influence versus overhype critiques\n\nStyles' solo career has garnered acclaim for its commercial dominance and cultural visibility, with proponents arguing it signals a broader influence on pop music and gender expression in performance. His albums, such as *Harry's House* (2022), topped charts globally and earned Grammy wins, including Album of the Year, positioning him as a successor to legacy acts through eclectic borrowings from 1970s rock and funk. However, this visibility stems partly from aggressive marketing and media amplification rather than groundbreaking artistry, as his work synthesizes familiar influences without substantial innovation. Critics note that while Styles draws from icons like Fleetwood Mac and David Bowie, his output remains formulaic pop, prioritizing pastiche over original sonic development. \n\nDetractors contend that Styles' influence is overhyped, with his musical contributions lacking the depth to endure beyond fan-driven metrics. Music reviewers have highlighted \"lackluster lyricism\" and an absence of emotional complexity, suggesting his songs succeed through production polish but fail to articulate profound statements or inspire genre shifts in contemporaries. Online discourse echoes this, labeling his solo material as \"mediocre\" and tailored to nostalgic One Direction audiences, with pretentious styling overshadowing substantive songcraft.  Empirical evidence supports skepticism of lasting impact: despite billions of streams, few verifiable instances exist of Styles directly shaping other musicians' creative trajectories, unlike predecessors who birthed subgenres or stylistic revolutions.\n\nIn fashion and cultural spheres, Styles' promotion of fluid aesthetics—such as pearl necklaces and skirts for men—has been credited with normalizing such expressions, yet critiques frame this as performative rather than transformative, amplified by media outlets predisposed to celebrate alignment with prevailing social narratives. Long-term viability remains uncertain; while his tours demonstrate strong fan engagement, the reliance on visual spectacle and borrowed tropes risks fading without evolving artistic substance, positioning him more as a transient pop phenomenon than a foundational figure. This tension underscores a career buoyed by hype machinery, where commercial peaks do not guarantee enduring reverence in musical history.\n\n## Discography\n\n### Studio albums\n\nStyles released his eponymous debut studio album, *Harry Styles*, on May 12, 2017, through Columbia Records. The record, comprising 10 tracks, drew from 1970s rock influences including Fleetwood Mac and the Rolling Stones, with production emphasizing Styles' baritone vocals amid melancholic, heartbreak-themed lyrics. Critics noted its shift from One Direction's pop sound toward classic rock homage, praising the vocal delivery while critiquing occasional lyrical simplicity.  It debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart with nearly 57,000 units sold in its first week and reached number one in Australia, Canada, Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and Scotland. In the United States, it entered the Billboard 200 at number two with approximately 230,000 album-equivalent units, marking a strong solo launch but trailing later efforts.\n\nHis second album, *Fine Line*, followed on December 13, 2019, also via Columbia Records. Featuring 12 tracks with contributions from producers like Tyler Johnson and Kid Harpoon, it blended psychedelic pop, funk, and rock elements, yielding hits such as \"Watermelon Sugar.\" The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, selling 478,000 equivalent units in its first week—including 393,000 in pure sales—the third-largest debut of 2019 and the biggest ever for an English male artist's sophomore release.  It also topped charts in the UK, Australia, Canada, Ireland, and New Zealand, accumulating over 5 million units sold worldwide to date.\n\n*Harry's House*, Styles' third studio album, arrived on May 20, 2022, under Columbia Records. The 13-track set incorporated pop, disco, and indie influences, led by the single \"As It Was,\" and was recorded primarily in Styles' home studio. It debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 with 521,500 equivalent units—330,000 from pure sales, the highest sales week of 2022—and set a record for vinyl sales in a single week at 182,000 copies.  The album also claimed number one positions in the UK and multiple international markets, contributing to Styles' cumulative equivalent album sales exceeding 36 million units across his catalog, with *Fine Line* as the top performer at 15 million.\n\n| Album          | Release date   | US debut units | Worldwide sales (equiv.) |\n|----------------|----------------|----------------|--------------------------|\n| *Harry Styles* | May 12, 2017  | ~230,000      | 2.1 million     |\n| *Fine Line*    | Dec 13, 2019  | 478,000       | 15 million      |\n| *Harry's House*| May 20, 2022  | 521,500       | ~10 million+    |\n\n### Singles and collaborations\n\nStyles released his debut solo single, \"Sign of the Times\", on April 7, 2017, ahead of his self-titled album. The track debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart, holding the position for one week and accumulating 27 weeks on the chart, while reaching number four on the US Billboard Hot 100.\n\nFor his second album, *Fine Line* (2019), Styles issued \"Lights Up\" as the lead single on October 11, 2019, which peaked at number three in the UK. Follow-up singles \"Adore You\" (November 2019) and \"Watermelon Sugar\" (November 16, 2019) both entered the UK top ten, with the latter achieving number one on the US Hot 100 in early 2020 following sustained radio airplay and social media traction. \"Falling\" was later promoted as a single in 2020, peaking at number 15 in the UK.\n\nThe lead single from *Harry's House* (2022), \"As It Was\" (April 2022), marked Styles' second UK number one, spending ten weeks at the top and 102 weeks on the chart overall; it also topped the US Hot 100 for 15 weeks, one of only five songs to achieve that duration. Subsequent singles \"Late Night Talking\" and \"Satellite\" reached numbers two and 18 in the UK, respectively, with \"Music for a Sushi Restaurant\" peaking at number three.\n\n| Single              | Release Date   | Album          | UK Peak | US Hot 100 Peak |\n|---------------------|----------------|----------------|---------|-----------------|\n| Sign of the Times   | April 7, 2017 | *Harry Styles* | 1      | 4              |\n| Lights Up           | October 11, 2019 | *Fine Line*  | 3      | 18             |\n| Adore You           | November 13, 2019 | *Fine Line* | 7      | 15             |\n| Watermelon Sugar    | November 16, 2019 | *Fine Line* | 4      | 1              |\n| As It Was           | April 1, 2022 | *Harry's House* | 1    | 1              |\n| Late Night Talking  | May 2022      | *Harry's House* | 2    | 4              |\n\nStyles' recorded output features no vocal collaborations or guest features on singles; his albums contain solely his own vocals, emphasizing a solo artist approach without remixes or shared credits on released tracks. He has co-written songs for other performers, including Ariana Grande's \"Just a Little Bit of Your Heart\" from *My Everything* (2014), and engaged in live duets such as \"You're Still the One\" with Shania Twain during her 2022 tour.\n\n## Filmography\n\n### Feature films\n\nStyles made his feature film debut in the war drama *Dunkirk* (2017), directed by Christopher Nolan, portraying Alex, a young Royal Army soldier during the Dunkirk evacuation of World War II. The ensemble cast film, which earned over $526 million worldwide against a $100 million budget, focused on the historical Operation Dynamo without emphasizing individual backstories, including Styles' character who engages in a brief conflict with another soldier.\n\nIn 2021, Styles appeared in a post-credits cameo as Eros (also known as Starfox), the brother of Thanos, in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film *Eternals*, directed by Chloé Zhao. This uncredited role introduced the character alongside Pip the Troll, setting up potential future storylines in the franchise, though Styles has not reprised it as of 2025.\n\nStyles starred as Jack Chambers in the psychological thriller *Don't Worry Darling* (2022), directed by Olivia Wilde, depicting a 1950s housewife's husband in a secretive utopian community that unravels into dystopian revelations. The film grossed $70 million against a $30–40 million budget but faced production controversies, including reported tensions between cast members and the director's handling of lead actor recasting.\n\nAlso in 2022, he portrayed the younger Tom Burgess in the romantic drama *My Policeman*, directed by Michael Grandage and adapted from Bethan Roberts' novel, exploring a policeman's forbidden same-sex relationship and marriage in 1950s England alongside a schoolteacher. The film, which premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival, received mixed reviews for its period authenticity and performances but underperformed commercially with limited theatrical release.\n\n### Other appearances\n\nStyles appeared alongside his One Direction bandmates as themselves in the *iCarly* episode \"iGo One Direction,\" which aired on Nickelodeon on November 7, 2012. In the episode, the group visits the web show's studio, rehearses and performs their debut single \"What Makes You Beautiful,\" and becomes ill after consuming contaminated water leading to a fictional \"jungle worms\" ailment.\n\nHe has hosted *Saturday Night Live* on several occasions, including episodes on December 14, 2019, and February 26, 2022, during which he performed in comedic sketches such as holiday baking competitions and commercial parodies.",
