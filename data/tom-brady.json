  "content": "# Tom Brady\n\nThomas Edward Patrick Brady Jr. (born August 3, 1977) is an American former professional football quarterback who played 23 seasons in the National Football League (NFL). Drafted 199th overall by the New England Patriots in the 2000 NFL Draft, Brady spent his first 20 seasons with the franchise, forming a dynasty under coach Bill Belichick that yielded six Super Bowl victories. He joined the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for his final three seasons, winning a seventh Super Bowl in 2021, the most championships by any player in NFL history. Brady holds league records for career passing yards (89,214), passing touchdowns (649), and regular-season wins (251), achievements sustained through exceptional preparation, accuracy, and performance into his mid-40s. His career featured controversies, including the 2007 Spygate videotaping scandal involving the Patriots and the 2015 Deflategate incident over underinflated footballs, which led to a four-game suspension upheld on appeal despite Brady's denials of involvement. Following his retirement on February 1, 2023, Brady transitioned to broadcasting and business ventures while being inducted into the Patriots Hall of Fame.\n\n## Early Life and Education\n\n### Childhood and Family Background\n\nThomas Edward Patrick Brady Jr. was born on August 3, 1977, in San Mateo, California, to Galynn Patricia Brady (née Johnson) and Thomas Edward Brady Sr. As the only son and youngest of four children, he grew up with three older sisters: Maureen, Julie, and Nancy. The family resided in San Mateo, where Brady spent his formative years in a Catholic household.\n\nBrady's parents, who married in 1969 and marked 55 years together by 2024, provided a stable environment in their San Mateo home, where they continue to reside. His father, of Irish descent, worked as an executive in the insurance industry and later owned a financial planning firm. Brady's mother, born and raised in Browerville, Minnesota, to parents of Norwegian, Polish, and Swedish ancestry, initially worked for Northwest Airlines before employment at a credit union; she instilled Midwestern values during family summers spent on her rural relatives' farm.\n\nBrady's upbringing emphasized family closeness and competitiveness, with his sisters often dominating backyard games, fostering resilience in the youngest sibling. The family's support extended to attending his games and, later, his professional milestones, though Galynn faced breast cancer in 2020, from which she recovered. Despite not being an early athletic prodigy, Brady's childhood in the San Francisco Bay Area, as a fan of the local 49ers, laid foundational interests in football amid a middle-class setting.\n\n### High School Athletic Career\n\nTom Brady attended Junípero Serra High School, an all-boys Catholic institution in San Mateo, California, where he graduated in 1995. He competed in three sports: football, baseball, and basketball. In football, Brady began as a backup on the junior varsity team during his early years before securing the starting quarterback role on varsity as a junior and senior. \n\nDuring his junior season, Brady started every game, leading the team to victories in 10 of his final 11 outings. As a senior in 1994, he passed for 3,692 yards with 40 touchdowns and 12 interceptions, while rushing for 332 yards and eight touchdowns. Over his two varsity seasons, these performances yielded roughly 4,000 passing yards and 33 touchdowns. Despite earning All-State and All-Far West honors, along with team player-of-the-year recognition twice, Brady received limited college recruiting interest, reflecting the era's emphasis on physical measurables over on-field production for quarterbacks from non-elite programs. \n\nIn baseball, Brady played catcher and helped his junior-year team capture the Central Coast Section (CCS) Championship in 1993, though he went hitless in the title game. His skills drew professional attention, leading to his selection by the Montreal Expos in the 18th round (507th overall) of the 1995 Major League Baseball Draft. Brady also participated in basketball, rounding out his multi-sport profile at Serra, though specific achievements in that sport are less documented.\n\n### University of Michigan College Career\n\nTom Brady enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1996 and joined the Wolverines football team as a quarterback, initially competing as third-string behind Brian Griese and Scott Dreisbach. As a freshman in 1996, he appeared in two games, completing 3 of 5 passes for 26 yards with one interception. In 1997, his sophomore year, Brady served as the backup to Griese during Michigan's undefeated national championship season, seeing action in four games with 12 completions out of 15 attempts for 103 yards.\n\nEntering his junior year in 1998, Brady secured the starting quarterback position ahead of highly recruited freshman Drew Henson, a dual-sport athlete also pursued by Major League Baseball teams. He started all 12 games, passing for 2,427 yards with 14 touchdowns and 10 interceptions at a 61.9% completion rate, while contributing two rushing touchdowns despite a net negative of 105 rushing yards. Under Brady's leadership, Michigan finished 10-3, sharing the Big Ten Conference title, and rallied from a 21-point deficit to defeat Arkansas 45-31 in the 1999 Citrus Bowl, where he threw for 209 yards and one touchdown. \n\nIn 1999, Brady's senior season, head coach Lloyd Carr alternated starts between Brady and Henson early on amid fan and media scrutiny over the decision to bench the incumbent in favor of the sophomore prospect.  Brady ultimately started 11 of 12 games, recording 2,217 passing yards, 16 touchdowns, and six interceptions at 61.0% completion, plus one rushing touchdown. The Wolverines achieved a 10-2 regular-season record, including victories over Penn State and Ohio State, before Brady engineered a comeback from a 14-point deficit to secure a 35-34 overtime win against Alabama in the 2000 Orange Bowl. Over his two starting seasons, Brady compiled a 20-5 record, contributing to Michigan's 40-9 mark during his four years on the roster.\n\n### College Statistics\n\nTom Brady's college football statistics at the University of Michigan reflect his progression from a backup quarterback to a starter, with limited appearances in his first two seasons before taking over as the primary signal-caller in 1998 and 1999. Over 29 games from 1996 to 1999, he completed 395 of 638 passes for 4,773 yards, 30 touchdowns, and 17 interceptions, achieving a 61.9% completion percentage and a 132.9 passer rating. His performance improved significantly as a starter, posting 4,644 yards, 30 touchdowns, and 16 interceptions with a 61.4% completion rate across those two seasons, during which Michigan compiled a 19-6 record in games he started.\n\nBrady's rushing contributions were minimal, with negative net yards due to sacks, totaling -57 yards on 76 carries over his career. He also fumbled 13 times, recovering 5.\n\n| Year | Games | Completions | Attempts | Completion % | Yards | Touchdowns | Interceptions | Passer Rating |\n|------|-------|-------------|----------|--------------|-------|------------|---------------|---------------|\n| 1996 | 2     | 3           | 5        | 60.0         | 26    | 0          | 1             | 63.7          |\n| 1997 | 4     | 12          | 15       | 80.0         | 103   | 0          | 0             | 137.7         |\n| 1998 | 12    | 200         | 323      | 61.9         | 2,427 | 14         | 10            | 133.1         |\n| 1999 | 11    | 180         | 295      | 61.0         | 2,217 | 16         | 6             | 138.0         |\n| Career | 29 | 395     | 638      | 61.9         | 4,773 | 30         | 17            | 132.9         |\n\n## NFL Draft and Professional Career\n\n### 2000 NFL Draft and Early New England Patriots Years\n\nThe New England Patriots selected Tom Brady in the sixth round of the 2000 NFL Draft, 199th overall, on April 15, 2000. Despite leading the Michigan Wolverines to a shared Big Ten title and Orange Bowl victory in 1999, Brady's draft stock was diminished by scouting reports citing marginal arm strength, lack of mobility, a lanky frame at 6 feet 4 inches and 211 pounds, and a poor performance at the NFL Combine where he ran a 5.28-second 40-yard dash. NFL analyst Mel Kiper Jr. graded him as a late-round prospect, ranking him 10th among quarterback prospects, while other evaluators noted his ordinary physical tools overshadowed intangibles like preparation and competitiveness. \n\nBrady signed a four-year rookie contract worth approximately $3.15 million with the Patriots, positioning him as the backup quarterback behind incumbent starter Drew Bledsoe. During his 2000 rookie season, Brady appeared in one game, completing 1 of 3 passes for 6 yards with a passer rating of 42.4, primarily serving in mop-up duty as the third-string option behind Bledsoe and John Friesz.  The Patriots finished 5-11 under first-year head coach Bill Belichick, with Bledsoe throwing for 3,291 yards but struggling amid offensive line issues and a 29-interception total by the quarterback trio.\n\nEntering the 2001 preseason, Brady competed intensely with Bledsoe for the starting role, impressing coaches with his command of the offense and work ethic during training camp, as documented in his personal diary entries. Bledsoe retained the starting position for Week 1, but in Week 2 on September 23, 2001, against the New York Jets, Bledsoe suffered a severe sheared blood vessel in his chest after a hit from linebacker Mo Lewis, forcing him out after one series. Brady entered the game, completing 5 of 10 passes for 46 yards in a 10-3 loss, marking the beginning of his transition to the starting quarterback role for the remainder of the season.\n\n### Rise to Prominence and Super Bowl Dominance (2001-2007)\n\nIn the 2001 NFL season, Tom Brady, a sixth-round draft pick from the previous year, became the New England Patriots' starting quarterback after Drew Bledsoe suffered a severe chest injury in Week 2 against the New York Jets on September 23. Brady led the team to an 11-5 record, including a 5-2 start in his initial stint as starter, and guided them through the playoffs with efficient play emphasizing ball security and defensive support under coach Bill Belichick. In Super Bowl XXXVI on February 3, 2002, the Patriots upset the St. Louis Rams 20-17, with Brady completing 16 of 27 passes for 145 yards, one touchdown to David Patten, and a passer rating of 86.2; he orchestrated a crucial late-game drive from the Patriots' 17-yard line, setting up Adam Vinatieri's game-winning 48-yard field goal as time expired.\n\nThe 2002 season saw the Patriots finish 9-7 and miss the playoffs, but Brady posted a 79.5 passer rating with 2,689 yards and 14 touchdowns in 15 starts, demonstrating resilience amid offensive line struggles. Rebounding in 2003, Brady threw for 3,620 yards, 23 touchdowns, and just 12 interceptions en route to a 14-2 regular-season record and the AFC's top seed. In Super Bowl XXXVIII on February 1, 2004, against the Carolina Panthers, he earned MVP honors with 32 completions out of 48 attempts for 354 yards, three touchdowns, and one interception, capping a high-scoring affair won 32-29 on Vinatieri's 41-yard field goal with nine seconds remaining.\n\nBuilding on this momentum, the 2004 Patriots again went 14-2, with Brady passing for 3,692 yards, 28 touchdowns, and 14 interceptions while integrating running back Corey Dillon's league-leading 1,635 rushing yards. In Super Bowl XXXIX on February 6, 2005, they defeated the Philadelphia Eagles 24-21, as Brady went 23-for-33 for 236 yards and two touchdowns in a defensively anchored victory that solidified New England's early dynasty with three championships in four seasons.\n\nInjuries hampered Brady in 2005 and 2006, though he started all 16 games each year amid a 10-6 record both seasons, though the Patriots won the AFC East and made the playoffs; he recorded passer ratings of 92.6 and 87.0, respectively, with totals of 3,759 yards and 26 touchdowns across those campaigns. The 2007 season marked offensive dominance, as Brady set NFL single-season records with 4,806 passing yards and 50 touchdowns—fueled by the acquisition of Randy Moss—leading to the first 16-0 regular season in the modern era and a 117.2 passer rating. However, in Super Bowl XLII on February 3, 2008, the undefeated Patriots fell 17-14 to the New York Giants, with Brady completing 18 of 34 passes for 266 yards, two touchdowns (one to Moss), and one interception in a game defined by New York's late defensive stands and Eli Manning's improvised escape for a touchdown to Plaxico Burress.\n\n### Mid-Career Challenges and Resurgence (2008-2013)\n\nIn the season opener on September 7, 2008, against the Kansas City Chiefs, Brady suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and partial tear of the medial collateral ligament (MCL) in his left knee after a low hit by safety Bernard Pollard during the first quarter, resulting in season-ending surgery on September 9 and placement on injured reserve. The injury abruptly halted momentum from the Patriots' undefeated 2007 regular season, forcing reliance on backup Matt Cassel, who led the team to an 11-5 record and a wild-card playoff berth before a 13-10 loss to the Baltimore Ravens. Brady's absence highlighted vulnerabilities in the team's depth and quarterback succession planning, contributing to perceptions of a dynasty interruption amid lingering fallout from the 2007 Spygate scandal, which had prompted stricter NFL enforcement of sideline filming rules.\n\nBrady returned for the 2009 season, posting 4,035 passing yards, 25 touchdowns, and 13 interceptions with a 93.0 passer rating, but the Patriots finished 10-6 atop the AFC East amid offensive inconsistencies and defensive lapses, exiting the playoffs with another wild-card defeat to the Ravens (33-14). In 2010, despite a franchise-best 14-2 regular-season mark, Brady threw for 3,517 yards, a league-high 36 touchdowns, and just 4 interceptions (111.1 rating), yet the team suffered a 28-21 divisional-round upset to the New York Jets after trading disgruntled receiver Randy Moss midseason, which disrupted offensive rhythm and fueled criticism of personnel decisions. These years marked challenges in sustaining elite playoff execution, with Brady facing scrutiny for mechanical adjustments post-injury and adapting to evolving defensive schemes emphasizing underneath coverage.\n\nThe 2011 season signaled resurgence, as Brady led the NFL with 5,235 passing yards, 39 touchdowns (tying his career high at the time), and 15 interceptions (105.6 rating), setting single-season records for completions (401) and attempts (611) en route to a 13-3 record. The Patriots advanced past the Denver Broncos (45-10) and Ravens (23-20 in overtime) before falling to the New York Giants 21-17 in Super Bowl XLVI, where Brady's late-game drive stalled at the 1-yard line amid protection breakdowns. In 2012, Brady threw for 4,817 yards, 34 touchdowns, and 8 interceptions (105.7 rating) during a 12-4 campaign, defeating the Texans (41-28) but losing the AFC Championship 28-13 to the Ravens after squandering a halftime lead. The 2013 season continued this individual dominance with 4,343 yards, 25 touchdowns, and 11 interceptions (87.3 rating) for another 12-4 finish, though a 26-16 AFC Championship loss to the Denver Broncos underscored persistent postseason hurdles against high-powered offenses. These years demonstrated Brady's resilience through refined mechanics, quick-release precision, and leadership in high-volume passing attacks, reestablishing him as an MVP-caliber performer despite team-wide execution gaps in critical moments.\n\n### Final Patriots Super Bowl Wins and Departure (2014-2019)\n\nThe 2014 New England Patriots season culminated in controversy during the AFC Championship Game against the Indianapolis Colts on January 18, 2015, when 11 of the 12 Patriots game balls were found deflated below the NFL's required pressure range of 12.5 to 13.5 PSI. An NFL-commissioned investigation by Ted Wells concluded that it was \"more probable than not\" that two Patriots personnel deliberately deflated the balls and that quarterback Tom Brady was generally aware of the tampering. Brady was suspended for the first four games of the 2015 season, the team was fined $1 million, and they forfeited a first-round draft pick; Brady appealed the suspension, which was initially overturned by U.S. District Judge Richard Berman in September 2015 but reinstated by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in April 2016, leading him to serve the penalty at the start of that year.\n\nDespite the scandal, the Patriots advanced to Super Bowl XLIX against the Seattle Seahawks on February 1, 2015, where Brady completed 37 of 50 passes for 328 yards, four touchdowns, and two interceptions, securing a 28-24 victory highlighted by Malcolm Butler's goal-line interception in the final seconds. This marked Brady's fourth Super Bowl win and extended the Patriots' dynasty under coach Bill Belichick.\n\nIn the 2015 season, Brady threw for 4,770 yards and 36 touchdowns despite missing the first four games due to his suspension, leading the Patriots to a 12-4 record and their sixth consecutive AFC Championship appearance. They faced the Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl LI on February 5, 2017, trailing 28-3 in the third quarter before mounting the largest comeback in Super Bowl history; Brady passed for 466 yards and two touchdowns on 43 of 62 attempts, with James White scoring three touchdowns in overtime for a 34-28 win. This victory delivered Brady's fifth ring and tied him with Belichick for the most Super Bowl wins by a head coach-quarterback duo.\n\nThe 2017 season saw the Patriots reach Super Bowl LII against the Philadelphia Eagles on February 4, 2018, but they lost 41-33 after Brady threw for 505 yards and three touchdowns, including a late score that brought them within three points; a failed two-point conversion and Nick Foles' performance sealed the defeat. Brady rebounded in 2018, guiding the 11-5 Patriots to Super Bowl LIII versus the Los Angeles Rams on February 3, 2019, where his 21-of-35 performance for 262 yards and no touchdowns supported a defense-led 13-3 shutout victory—his sixth Super Bowl title and third with the Patriots in this era.\n\nThe 2019 Patriots finished 12-5 but were upset in the wild-card playoff round by the Tennessee Titans on January 4, 2020, ending their postseason streak. Brady, entering free agency at age 42 after 20 seasons with New England, departed amid reported tensions with Belichick over contract terms—he sought a two-year deal worth around $50 million with greater input on roster decisions—and differing visions for the team's future, signing a two-year, $50 million contract with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on March 20, 2020.  Brady later acknowledged that Belichick's continued role as head coach influenced his decision not to return, citing accumulated strains in their relationship.\n\n### Tampa Bay Buccaneers Tenure (2020-2022)\n\nOn March 20, 2020, Brady signed a two-year contract with the Buccaneers worth $50 million, fully guaranteed, with an additional $9 million in possible incentives. In his first season, he started all 16 games, posting an 11-5 record while completing 401 of 610 passes for 4,633 yards, 40 touchdowns, and 12 interceptions, setting a franchise single-season record for touchdown passes. The Buccaneers earned the NFC's fifth seed and advanced through the playoffs, defeating the Washington Football Team 31-23 in the wild card round on January 9, 2021, the New Orleans Saints 30-20 in the divisional round on January 17, and the Green Bay Packers 31-26 in the NFC Championship Game on January 24.\n\nIn Super Bowl LV on February 7, 2021, the Buccaneers defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 31-9, with Brady completing 21 of 29 passes for 201 yards and three touchdowns, earning his fifth Super Bowl MVP award. This victory marked Brady's seventh Super Bowl win overall and the Buccaneers' second franchise title, played at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa due to COVID-19 protocols.\n\nDuring the 2021 regular season, expanded to 17 games, Brady started all 17 contests, leading the Buccaneers to a 13-4 record and the NFC's second seed as he topped the NFL with 5,316 passing yards and 43 touchdown passes, completing 485 of 719 attempts (67.5%) with 12 interceptions. In the playoffs, the Buccaneers defeated the Philadelphia Eagles 31-15 in the wild card round on January 16, 2022, before losing to the Los Angeles Rams 30-27 in the divisional round on January 23.\n\nIn 2022, Brady started all 17 games amid team injuries and offensive line struggles, finishing with a 490-for-733 performance (66.8% completion), 4,694 yards, 25 touchdowns, and nine interceptions as the Buccaneers ended 8-9 but clinched the NFC South due to the division's weakness. They hosted the Dallas Cowboys in the wild card round on January 16, 2023, losing 31-14, with Brady throwing for 351 yards, two touchdowns, and one interception in his final game before initial retirement.\n\n### Retirement Decisions\n\nOn February 1, 2022, Tom Brady announced his retirement from the NFL via an Instagram video, stating that his decision followed a \"thrilling ride of 22 years in the NFL\" and that he would no longer play professional football. At age 44, Brady cited personal reflection after discussions with family and close advisors, though the announcement came amid reports of leaks to media outlets, which he later described as pressuring him into a premature public statement before fully committing. This initial retirement lasted only 40 days, during which Brady evaluated his competitive drive and the feasibility of continuing with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers amid ongoing team negotiations.\n\nBrady reversed course on March 13, 2022, posting on social media that he was returning to the Buccaneers for his 23rd season, emphasizing his unfinished business in the sport and the pull of elite performance potential despite physical demands. The unretirement decision strained his marriage to Gisele Bündchen, who had advocated for more family focus post-retirement; sources close to the couple indicated this reversal exacerbated tensions over work-life balance, contributing to their divorce filing in October 2022. During the 2022 season, Brady led the Buccaneers to an 8-9 record and a wild-card playoff berth, but they lost in the divisional round to the Dallas Cowboys, with Brady throwing for 4,694 yards and 25 touchdowns amid visible team discord and personal challenges.\n\nBrady announced his second retirement on February 1, 2023—exactly one year after the first—via a video message, declaring it \"for good\" after 23 seasons and expressing intent to prioritize family time with his children and explore broadcasting opportunities, including a pre-signed Fox Sports deal. The decision followed the recent divorce, which multiple reports linked to irreconcilable differences over his football commitments, with Bündchen seeking greater post-career stability that the unretirement undermined. Unlike the first announcement, this one was controlled internally to avoid leaks, reflecting Brady's resolve after weighing sustained high-level play against accumulating physical toll and familial priorities, with no subsequent reversal as of October 2025.\n\n## Career Statistics and Records\n\n### Regular Season Passing and Rushing Stats\n\nTom Brady appeared in 335 regular season games across 23 NFL seasons with the New England Patriots (2000–2019) and Tampa Bay Buccaneers (2020–2022), compiling 89,214 passing yards, the most in NFL history. His passing totals include 7,753 completions on 12,050 attempts for a 64.3% completion rate, 649 touchdowns (second all-time), 212 interceptions, and a 97.2 passer rating. Brady averaged 266.3 passing yards per game, with single-season highs of 5,316 yards in 2021 (third-highest in NFL history at the time) and 50 touchdowns in 2007 (tied for second-highest ever).\n\n| Passing Stat | Career Total |\n|--------------|--------------|\n| Games Played | 335         |\n| Completions  | 7,753       |\n| Attempts     | 12,050      |\n| Completion % | 64.3        |\n| Yards        | 89,214      |\n| Touchdowns   | 649         |\n| Interceptions| 212         |\n| Passer Rating| 97.2        |\n\nBrady's regular season rushing stats reflect his pocket-passer style, with 730 carries for 1,123 yards (1.5 yards per carry average) and 29 touchdowns, primarily from sneaks and scrambles.

His postseason passing statistics include 13,400 yards, 88 touchdowns, and 40 interceptions, with a passer rating of 89.8. These figures reflect consistent excellence, particularly in high-stakes elimination games, where he demonstrated superior decision-making and resilience under pressure.\n\nBrady's playoff dominance spanned multiple eras, beginning with the New England Patriots and extending to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He secured 35 victories against 13 losses, outperforming contemporaries like Peyton Manning and Aaron Rodgers in volume and win percentage. Notable achievements include 14 consecutive playoff wins from 2001 to 2003, contributing to three Super Bowl titles in four years.\n\n| Season | Game | Opponent | Result | Completions/Attempts | Yards | TDs | INTs | Rating |\n|--------|------|----------|--------|----------------------|-------|-----|------|--------|\n| 2001   | Super Bowl XXXVI | St. Louis Rams | W 20–17 | 16/27 | 145 | 1 | 0 | 86.2 |\n| 2003   | Super Bowl XXXVIII | Carolina Panthers | W 32–29 | 23/33 | 248 | 2 | 0 | 123.1 |\n| 2004   | Super Bowl XXXIX | Philadelphia Eagles | W 24–21 | 23/35 | 236 | 2 | 0 | 105.4 |\n| 2007   | Super Bowl XLII | New York Giants | L 14–17 | 14/25 | 157 | 0 | 0 | 82.8 |\n| 2011   | Super Bowl XLVI | New York Giants | L 17–21 | 27/48 | 276 | 1 | 0 | 82.1 |\n| 2014   | Super Bowl XLIX | Seattle Seahawks | W 28–24 | 27/39 | 328 | 4 | 1 | 111.1 |\n| 2016   | Super Bowl LI | Atlanta Falcons | W 34–28 (OT) | 43/62 | 466 | 2 | 1 | 92.4 |\n| 2018   | Super Bowl LII | Philadelphia Eagles | L 33–41 | 28/48 | 505 | 3 | 2 | 84.7 |\n| 2018   | Super Bowl LIII | Los Angeles Rams | W 13–3 | 21/35 | 262 | 0 | 0 | 88.5 |\n| 2020   | Super Bowl LV | Kansas City Chiefs | W 31–9 | 21/29 | 201 | 3 | 0 | 125.8 |\n\nIn Super Bowls, Brady appeared in 10 games, winning seven and earning three MVP awards, with career totals of 3,039 passing yards, 21 touchdowns, and six interceptions for a 97.7 passer rating. His performances often defined the outcomes, such as the record-setting 505 yards in Super Bowl LII despite the loss, and the historic comeback in Super Bowl LI, where he overcame a 28–3 deficit to force overtime and secure victory. In Super Bowl LV with Tampa Bay, he threw for three touchdowns without interceptions, clinching a 31–9 win over the defending champion Chiefs.\n\nBrady's Super Bowl victories include XXXVI (2002), XXXVIII (2004), XXXIX (2005), XLIX (2015), LI (2017), LIII (2019), and LV (2021), tying him with multiple teams for the most championships by a quarterback. Losses came in XLII (2008), XLVI (2012), and LII (2018), often against underdog opponents like the New York Giants and Philadelphia Eagles, highlighting defensive vulnerabilities despite his individual output. These games underscore his clutch ability, with multiple instances of leading game-winning drives in the fourth quarter or overtime.\n\n### All-Time NFL Records Held\n\nTom Brady holds several all-time NFL records in career passing statistics, reflecting his longevity and productivity over 23 seasons from 2000 to 2022. He amassed the most career passing yards with 89,214, surpassing Drew Brees' 80,358. Brady also leads in career passing touchdowns with 649, ahead of Brees' 571.\n\nIn team success metrics, Brady recorded the most regular-season wins as a starting quarterback with 251 victories in 335 appearances. His postseason achievements include the most playoff wins by a quarterback with 35, achieved in 48 starts with a .729 winning percentage. Brady further set the benchmark for quarterback starts with 333.\n\nBrady's dominance extends to championships, where he holds the record for most Super Bowl victories with seven (XXXVI, XXXVIII, XXXIX, XLIX, LI, LIII, LV), more than any other player or franchise. These records remain intact as of October 2025, with no active quarterback approaching his totals in passing volume or playoff success.\n\n| Record Category              | Statistic          | Notes |\n|------------------------------|--------------------|-------|\n| Career passing yards        | 89,214            | Regular season; leads Drew Brees (80,358) |\n| Career passing touchdowns   | 649               | Regular season; leads Drew Brees (571) |\n| Regular-season wins (starting QB) | 251          | In 335 games |\n| Playoff wins (QB)           | 35                | In 48 starts |\n| Super Bowl wins             | 7                 | XXXVI, XXXVIII, XXXIX, XLIX, LI, LIII, LV |\n| Games started (QB)          | 333               | Regular season |\n\n### Franchise-Specific Records\n\nDuring his 20 seasons with the **New England Patriots** from 2000 to 2019, Tom Brady established himself as the franchise's all-time leader in multiple passing categories, reflecting his longevity and consistency as the primary starter. He holds the career records for passing yards (74,571), passing touchdowns (541), completions (6,377), and pass attempts (9,988). Brady also set the franchise mark for regular-season wins by a starting quarterback (219) and consecutive regular-season starts (142 from 2009 to 2015). These figures encompass both regular-season and postseason performances, where he additionally owns Patriots playoff records for passing yards (13,400) and touchdowns (88).\n\n| Category | Record | Source |\n|----------|--------|--------|\n| Career Passing Yards | 74,571 | Pro-Football-Reference |\n| Career Passing Touchdowns | 541 | Pro-Football-Reference |\n| Regular-Season Wins | 219 | CBS News |\n\nIn his three seasons with the **Tampa Bay Buccaneers** from 2020 to 2022, Brady quickly surpassed prior benchmarks despite the franchise's longer history of quarterbacks like Josh Freeman and Jameis Winston. He set single-season records for passing yards (5,316 in 2021) and passing touchdowns (43 in 2021), the latter eclipsing Winston's previous mark of 33 from 2019. His career totals with Tampa Bay—14,643 passing yards and 108 passing touchdowns—stand as franchise highs, outpacing Freeman's prior yardage lead of 13,534. Brady compiled a 32–18 regular-season record as starter, contributing to the team's first Super Bowl win since 2002.\n\n| Category | Record | Season/Total | Source |\n|----------|--------|--------------|--------|\n| Single-Season Passing Yards | 5,316 | 2021 | Buccaneers.com |\n| Single-Season Passing Touchdowns | 43 | 2021 | NFL.com |\n| Career Passing Yards | 14,643 | 2020–2022 | Statista |\n| Career Passing Touchdowns | 108 | 2020–2022 | Pro-Football-Reference\n\n## Awards, Honors, and Legacy\n\n### Major NFL Awards and Accolades\n\nTom Brady secured seven Super Bowl championships, the most by any player in NFL history, with the New England Patriots in the 2001, 2003, 2004, 2014, 2016, and 2018 seasons, and with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the 2020 season. He earned Super Bowl Most Valuable Player honors five times, in Super Bowls XXXVI, XXXVIII, XLIX, LI, and LV, establishing a record for the award.\n\nBrady received the Associated Press NFL Most Valuable Player Award three times, in 2007, 2010, and 2017, tying Peyton Manning for the most among quarterbacks. He also won the AP NFL Offensive Player of the Year Award twice, in 2007 and 2010, and the Bert Bell Memorial Award in 2007, recognizing him as the NFL's Player of the Year. In 2009, following an ACL injury, Brady was named AP NFL Comeback Player of the Year.\n\n| Award | Selections | Years |\n|-------|------------|-------|\n| Pro Bowl | 15 | 2001, 2004, 2005, 2007, 2009–2018, 2021 |\n| First-team All-Pro | 3 | 2007, 2010, 2017 |\n| Second-team All-Pro | 4 | 2005, 2016, 2021 |\n\nThese selections underscore Brady's sustained elite performance across two decades, with 15 Pro Bowl nods ranking first among quarterbacks. His 2017 MVP was unanimous, the first such honor for a quarterback.\n\n### Greatest of All Time Debate\n\nTom Brady's status as the greatest quarterback in NFL history is supported primarily by his record seven Super Bowl victories, achieved across 23 seasons with the New England Patriots and Tampa Bay Buccaneers, surpassing Joe Montana's four and any other quarterback. This includes three wins after age 40, demonstrating sustained elite performance amid physical decline typical for the position, with Brady leading the league in passer rating at age 43 during the 2020 season. He holds NFL records for most playoff wins (35), passing yards (13,400), and touchdown passes (88) in the postseason, metrics that quantify his effectiveness in high-stakes games where quarterback decision-making causally drives outcomes in a team-dependent sport.\n\nProponents, including Hall of Famer Jerry Rice, cite Brady's ability to win with multiple franchises and coordinators as evidence of individual impact over system dependency, noting his seventh ring with Tampa Bay in 2021 cemented \"GOAT status\" by replicating success without prior longtime coach Bill Belichick. Belichick himself described Brady as the \"greatest quarterback of all time\" based on his preparation and execution under pressure. Peers like Von Miller acknowledge Brady's championships and longevity as differentiating factors, though Miller personally favors others for peak talent. These achievements align with empirical measures of quarterback value, such as EPA per dropback in playoffs, where Brady ranks highly when adjusted for era, outperforming contemporaries in converting opportunities into wins.\n\nCritics argue Brady's volume statistics—89,214 regular-season passing yards and 649 touchdowns—are inflated by longevity and modern rules favoring passing (e.g., pass interference protections post-2010s), rather than per-game efficiency, where Montana leads in era-adjusted completion percentage (64.5% vs. Brady's 64.3%) and yards per attempt (7.8 vs. 7.5). Montana's undefeated 4-0 Super Bowl record and three MVPs in those games highlight superior clutch play in a pre-salary cap, harder-hitting era without alleged advantages like those scrutinized in Patriots scandals. Some attribute Brady's rings disproportionately to Belichick's defensive schemes and talent acquisition, noting Brady's .677 regular-season win percentage drops without New England and questioning his three Super Bowl losses as evidence of fallibility under equal footing. These views often stem from rival fanbases or analysts emphasizing peak dominance over cumulative totals, as in comparisons favoring Peyton Manning's five MVPs despite fewer rings.\n\nThe debate persists due to subjective weighting of metrics: team success (Brady's edge) versus individual per-snap brilliance (Montana's or Manning's case), with no universal formula resolving it empirically. However, in a results-oriented evaluation, Brady's unparalleled translation of preparation into victories—evidenced by 58 fourth-quarter comebacks and leading both conferences to titles—establishes a strong causal claim for preeminence, though era-normalized analytics continue to fuel dissent from traditionalists.\n\n### Cultural and Economic Impact\n\nTom Brady's prominence elevated the NFL's cultural footprint, establishing him as the league's inaugural global icon and ambassador for international expansion. His promotional engagements in nations such as Brazil, Japan, and Ghana drew enthusiastic crowds, aiding the NFL's push for worldwide relevance amid stagnant domestic growth. Brady's trajectory from a sixth-round draft selection in 2000 to securing seven Super Bowl victories encapsulated an underdog ethos of resilience and late-game mastery, which captivated audiences and motivated youth athletes by demonstrating that systematic preparation could surpass innate physical gifts.\n\nOn the field, Brady reshaped professional football's operational culture by championing mental fortitude, meticulous film study, and exploitation of marginal edges—principles that permeated NFL teams and even influenced European soccer, where Premier League clubs adopted similar optimization tactics for player longevity and performance. He redefined the franchise quarterback role, emphasizing leadership and adaptability over athletic spectacle, which compelled teams to recalibrate scouting and development strategies around sustained excellence rather than short-term star power. This shift contributed to heightened viewer engagement, with Brady's regular-season appearances from 2016 to 2021 averaging 2 million more viewers per game than matchups excluding him, thereby amplifying the sport's domestic allure.\n\nBrady's economic influence manifested through his endorsement portfolio and draw on league revenues. Over 23 seasons, he garnered at least $180 million from licensing, appearances, and deals with entities including Under Armour and Hertz, peaking at $9.5 million in NFL Players Association group marketing income for the year ending February 28, 2022. His elevated viewership directly bolstered NFL broadcast deals and advertising yields, as sustained high-profile success from his tenures with the Patriots and Buccaneers sustained franchise valuations—exemplified by Tampa Bay's Super Bowl LV triumph in February 2021 following his 2020 signing. Brady's aggregate brand equity, reflected in a 2025 net worth of approximately $300 million from on-field salaries exceeding $280 million, endorsements, and post-career broadcasting pacts like his $375 million Fox Sports agreement signed in 2022, highlighted his role in monetizing athlete longevity.\n\n## Controversies and Criticisms\n\n### Deflategate Scandal\n\nThe Deflategate scandal originated during the AFC Championship Game on January 18, 2015, between the New England Patriots and Indianapolis Colts at Gillette Stadium, where the Colts alleged that the Patriots had used underinflated footballs, violating NFL rules requiring inflation between 12.5 and 13.5 pounds per square inch (psi). At halftime, NFL officials tested 12 Patriots footballs and found 11 measured below 12.5 psi, ranging from 10.1 to 11.8 psi, while four Colts footballs were within or above the limit. The game temperature was approximately 47°F, cooler than the indoor pregame inspection at around 72°F, which critics later argued could explain the pressure drop via the ideal gas law without deliberate deflation.\n\nThe NFL commissioned an independent investigation led by attorney Ted Wells, whose report released on May 6, 2015, concluded it was \"more probable than not\" that two Patriots equipment staff members, equipment assistant John Jastremski and long-term consultant Jim McNally, deliberately deflated balls after pregame inspection, and that quarterback Tom Brady was \"at least generally aware\" of the scheme. The findings relied on circumstantial evidence, including text messages between Jastremski and McNally referring to McNally as the \"deflator\" and discussing needle use, as well as Brady's reported instructions to adjust pressures and his destruction of his cell phone shortly before an interview with investigators, which contained 10,000 messages including some with Jastremski. No direct evidence linked Brady to ordering deflation, and Brady denied knowledge or involvement, attributing phone destruction to routine replacement.\n\nCritics of the Wells report, including a statistical analysis by Exponent commissioned by the Patriots, argued the pressure measurements were consistent with natural environmental factors and that the NFL's testing methods, including inconsistent gauges and lack of chain-of-custody protocols for the footballs, undermined reliability. Independent reviews have questioned the report's scientific rigor, noting that the observed drops aligned with expected thermodynamic effects from temperature changes rather than tampering, and highlighted potential biases in the NFL's handling of evidence, such as not preserving game balls for re-testing. Wells defended the investigation as thorough and evidence-based, rejecting claims of flaws as \"ridiculous.\"\n\nOn May 11, 2015, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell suspended Brady for the first four games of the 2016 season, fined the Patriots $1 million, and forfeited their first-round 2016 draft pick and fourth-round 2017 pick, citing Brady's role in undermining integrity. Brady appealed, and Goodell upheld the suspension on July 28, 2015, emphasizing Brady's lack of cooperation. U.S. District Judge Richard Berman vacated the suspension on September 3, 2015, ruling the process violated the collective bargaining agreement due to inadequate notice and denial of appeal rights. The NFL appealed, and the Second Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated it on April 25, 2016, affirming Goodell's authority under the CBA. Brady declined to petition the U.S. Supreme Court and served the suspension, missing the first four games of the 2016 season.\n\nThe scandal fueled debates over NFL equipment enforcement and competitive advantages, leading to stricter pregame protocols, but retrospective analyses have often portrayed it as overreach based on weak evidence, with no conclusive proof of intentional wrongdoing beyond inference. Brady and the Patriots maintained innocence, framing the episode as a targeted response to prior controversies like Spygate.\n\n### Spygate Associations and Integrity Questions\n\nThe Spygate scandal broke on September 9, 2007, when New England Patriots video assistant Matt Estrella was observed and confronted filming the New York Jets' defensive coaches' signals from the team's sideline during a Week 1 game, an unauthorized location under NFL rules. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell fined head coach Bill Belichick $500,000—the league's maximum for an individual—fined the Patriots $250,000, and revoked their 2008 first-round draft pick on September 13, 2007; Goodell also ordered the destruction of the Jets game tape and other related materials held by the Patriots.\n\nFurther reporting revealed the practice was systematic, with the Patriots videotaping opponents' signals in at least 40 games from 2000 to 2007, maintaining a library of tapes and notes—including for the 2002 AFC Championship Game—and occasionally acquiring play sheets or scouting reports through advance scouts or disguised filming. The decoded signals aided offensive preparation by anticipating defensive calls, providing a competitive edge in a manner deemed illegal by the league.\n\nTom Brady, the Patriots' starting quarterback from 2001 onward and architect of their early-2000s dynasty—including Super Bowl victories in XXXVI (February 3, 2002), XXXVIII (February 1, 2004), and XXXIX (February 6, 2005)—faced no direct discipline in the Spygate probe, which targeted Belichick, video staff like Estrella, and operations director Ernie Adams rather than players. Brady later recalled Belichick instructing the team, including players, to address the matter internally without public comment during the unfolding crisis.\n\nNo verified evidence has surfaced implicating Brady in the videotaping or its coordination, though his role in calling audibles and plays positioned him to potentially utilize any derived signal intelligence for on-field decisions. Adams, a key figure in the operation, has refused to elaborate on specifics, stating in 2024 he would \"take [them] to the grave.\"\n\nThe episode nonetheless fueled persistent integrity questions about Brady's accomplishments amid the Patriots' 2000s dominance, with critics—including anonymous NFL owners—contending that the NFL's penalties were insufficiently severe, destroying evidence preemptively and sparing deeper scrutiny of prior Super Bowl triumphs potentially aided by the scheme. Some executives viewed the 2015 Deflategate sanctions on Brady—a four-game suspension for being \"generally aware\" of deflated footballs—as a corrective \"makeup call\" for Spygate's perceived leniency toward Robert Kraft and Belichick, reflecting league-wide resentment over the Patriots' edge. These debates underscore skepticism toward the untainted nature of Brady's records, even absent personal culpability, as the systemic rule-breaking undergirded a coaching-player partnership yielding six Super Bowl titles during his tenure.\n\n### Broadcasting and Ownership Conflicts of Interest\n\nTom Brady signed a 10-year, $375 million contract with Fox Sports in May 2022 to serve as the network's lead color commentator for NFL games starting with the 2024 season. This deal positioned him alongside play-by-play announcer Kevin Burkhardt, replacing Greg Olsen, whose prior role was displaced by Brady's arrival.\n\nIn 2023, Brady joined a group led by partner Tom Wagner to acquire a 10% minority stake in the Las Vegas Raiders for $220 million, with Brady holding approximately 5% individually; the NFL approved the transaction in October 2024. This ownership came months after his Fox broadcasting commitment, raising questions under NFL policies designed to prevent competitive advantages or biases in media coverage.\n\nThe dual roles prompted the NFL to impose initial restrictions, dubbed the \"Brady rules,\" barring him from visiting other teams' facilities, attending practices, or participating in in-person production meetings as a Raiders owner, to mitigate information-sharing risks during broadcasts of Raiders opponents. In August 2025, the league relaxed these by permitting virtual attendance at production meetings, though physical access remained prohibited. NFL spokesperson Brian McCarthy stated no policies forbid owners from game-day coaches' booths or headsets, following reports of Brady's presence in the Raiders' booth during a September 2025 matchup.\n\nMultiple NFL team officials expressed concerns that the arrangement disadvantages non-Raiders teams, as Brady's ownership limits his access to their proprietary information for neutral analysis, potentially skewing Fox broadcasts—particularly evident in his first three 2025 games calling Raiders opponents. Critics argued this creates an uneven playing field, with Brady defending the ethics by noting league approval and his non-involvement in Raiders operations beyond minority input. On September 24, 2025, Brady publicly dismissed distrust as unfounded, emphasizing compliance with rules and rejecting bias claims while blaming media amplification for perceptions of impropriety.\n\nPrior ownership pursuits amplified scrutiny: Brady's unsuccessful 2020 bid for a Raiders stake alongside Sheldon Adelson and failed minority interest in the Miami Dolphins during his playing career (leading to a 2022 NFL probe and owner Stephen Ross's suspension) highlighted recurring tensions between his business ambitions and NFL roles, though these predated his broadcasting tenure. The Raiders-Fox overlap remains the primary active conflict, with no formal penalties imposed as of October 2025, but ongoing debate among executives about impartiality in high-stakes analysis.\n\n### TB12 Method and Health Claims Scrutiny\n\nThe TB12 Method, developed by Tom Brady in collaboration with trainer Alex Guerrero, promotes a holistic approach to athletic performance and longevity through 12 principles emphasizing nutrition, functional movement, pliability, hydration, and mental resilience. Central claims include enhancing muscle pliability to prevent injuries and accelerate recovery, balancing bodily pH via alkaline-forming foods to reduce inflammation and extend career longevity, and achieving sustained peak performance into one's 40s, as exemplified by Brady's NFL tenure until age 45. The method posits that pliable muscles—defined as softer, longer, and more resilient than traditional strength-trained ones—insulate against injury, with Brady attributing his durability to daily hands-on therapy over weightlifting.\n\nNutritionally, the TB12 diet is predominantly plant-based (approximately 80% plants, 20% animal products), focusing on organic whole foods like vegetables, nuts, seeds, and lean proteins while restricting nightshade plants (e.g., tomatoes, peppers, eggplant) due to purported inflammatory effects, processed sugars, and dairy. Hydration protocols recommend starting the day with 20 ounces of electrolyte-infused water and consuming half one's body weight in ounces daily, with claims extending to preventing sunburn through overhydration. Recovery components stress 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. sleep schedules and mental toughness practices like positivity amid setbacks.\n\nScientific scrutiny reveals limited empirical support for many TB12 claims, with experts noting the regimen's reliance on anecdotal success rather than controlled studies. The alkaline diet aspect, aimed at countering acidity for anti-inflammation and longevity, lacks evidence, as human physiology tightly regulates blood pH independently of food intake, rendering dietary pH manipulation ineffective for health outcomes.  Nightshade restrictions stem from unproven inflammation links in healthy individuals, and overall dietary exclusions (e.g., no white flour, minimal caffeine) promote whole-food benefits like reduced sugar intake but impose unnecessary expense and restrictiveness without superior outcomes over balanced evidence-based nutrition. \n\nPliability training, favoring resistance bands and massage over heavy weights, shows no rigorous trials demonstrating injury prevention or recovery advantages beyond standard flexibility work, with critics viewing it as repackaged therapy lacking causal proof for Brady's longevity, which may owe more to genetics, skill, and conventional training. Hydration's sunburn prevention claim has been debunked by dermatologists, citing no evidence that fluid intake alters ultraviolet damage susceptibility. While elements like plant-rich eating and recovery emphasis align with general health guidelines for reducing chronic disease risk, the method's extraordinary assertions—e.g., defying age-related decline—remain unsubstantiated, prompting characterizations of pseudoscience in popular critiques.  Brady's personal outcomes provide correlative but not definitive validation, as no comparative data isolates TB12 from confounding factors like his professional regimen.\n\n### Personal Conduct and Family Allegations\n\nBrady's marriage to Gisele Bündchen ended in divorce on October 28, 2022, after 13 years, with both parties citing irreconcilable differences rooted in diverging life priorities rather than allegations of personal misconduct. Bündchen publicly described the split as the \"death of my dream,\" attributing it to growing apart, particularly after Brady's February 1, 2022, retirement announcement followed by his decision to unretire and return to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for the 2022 season, which she viewed as prioritizing professional commitments over family stability.  In a June 2025 newsletter, Brady acknowledged Bündchen's perspective, admitting that her sacrifices in pausing her career to focus on raising their children—Benjamin (born December 11, 2009) and Vivian (born December 5, 2012)—contrasted with his continued pursuit of football, contributing to relational strain.\n\nPublic speculation during the divorce included unverified rumors of infidelity, primarily directed at Bündchen's relationship with jiu-jitsu instructor Joaquim Valente, which she denied as an affair, stating it began post-separation as a friendship that evolved. Brady has not accused Bündchen of wrongdoing and emphasized in July 2025 reflections that the divorce was amicable, with joint custody and no public disputes over assets, though he subtly referenced providing for family amid shifting dynamics. Post-divorce rumors of Brady's own involvement with model Veronika Rajek surfaced in late 2022 based on her social media comments, but both parties denied any affair.\n\nBeyond the divorce, Brady's personal conduct has faced no substantiated allegations of legal or ethical breaches, such as domestic violence, substance abuse, or criminal activity; he maintains a record free of arrests or lawsuits related to family matters. Earlier family dynamics included the 2007 birth of son John \"Jack\" Edward Thomas Moynahan with ex-partner Bridget Moynahan, conceived before Brady began dating Bündchen, leading to a brief public surprise but resolved amicably with shared custody and no reported conflicts. The absence of verified misconduct allegations underscores a public image centered on professional rather than personal controversies, though divorce-related narratives have fueled perceptions of career-family imbalance without empirical evidence of neglect or abuse.\n\n## Business Ventures and Endorsements\n\n### TB12 Brand and Wellness Initiatives\n\nTB12, co-founded by Tom Brady and trainer Alex Guerrero in 2013, operates as a performance and wellness brand promoting a holistic approach to physical health centered on the TB12 Method. The method emphasizes muscle pliability—defined as muscles that are long, resilient, and capable of unrestricted movement to absorb and distribute forces—alongside principles of hydration, plant-based nutrition, functional strength training, and mental fitness. Brady detailed these concepts in his 2017 book *The TB12 Method*, which outlines routines for injury prevention and longevity, drawing from his personal regimen developed since meeting Guerrero in 2004.\n\nThe brand's wellness initiatives include nutritional guidelines advocating an 80/20 dietary split—80% plant-based foods like fruits, vegetables, nuts, and whole grains, with 20% lean animal products—supplemented by recipes, shopping lists, and prepared meals. TB12 offers products such as protein powders, electrolyte blends, and performance supplements incorporating ingredients like ashwagandha and mango leaf extract for recovery and immune support. Equipment like vibrating pliability rollers and spheres supports self-administered deep-tissue work to enhance muscle flexibility. In 2020, TB12 acquired VitalFit Nutrition to bolster its supplement offerings.\n\nEarly expansion involved physical centers providing sports therapy, pliability sessions, and training; locations opened in Foxborough and Boston, Massachusetts (2013–2016), Tampa and West Palm Beach, Florida (post-2020), and Philadelphia (2022), with planned sites in New York and Los Angeles. By 2023, reports emerged of facility closures and a pivot away from in-person services, with TB12 shifting focus to online sales and direct-to-consumer products as of June 2024, maintaining no physical retail locations. Additional initiatives include a raw snack line launched in 2016 and the TB12 Foundation for youth athlete development. The brand positions its practices as accessible for all ages and abilities, aiming to reduce pain and optimize performance through daily habits.\n\n### Media Appearances and Product Partnerships\n\nBrady has appeared in several films and television programs, often portraying himself or leveraging his athletic persona. In the 2003 comedy *Stuck on You*, he played a cameo role as himself alongside Matt Damon and Greg Kinnear. He starred in the 2023 film *80 for Brady*, a fictionalized account of four elderly women traveling to Super Bowl LI in 2017 to watch him play, which grossed $39 million at the box office despite mixed reviews. On television, Brady hosted *Saturday Night Live* on May 14, 2005, and voiced himself in a 2005 episode of *The Simpsons* titled \"Bart's Dog Gets an F\".\n\nDocumentary series have prominently featured Brady's career and mindset. *Tom vs. Time*, a six-episode Facebook Watch series released in January and April 2018, documented his preparation for Super Bowl LII, including training and family life. The nine-episode ESPN series *Man in the Arena: Tom Brady*, premiered in December 2021, provided his first-hand accounts of 10 Super Bowl appearances, drawing comparisons to *The Last Dance* for its introspective format. Other documentaries include *The Brady 6* (2011), focusing on his draft story; *The Great Brady Heist* (2020), about a stolen Super Bowl ring; and *All Madden* (2021), which included interviews on his relationship with coach John Madden.\n\nBrady's product partnerships emphasize performance apparel, wellness, and consumer goods, often aligned with his TB12 philosophy of pliability and recovery, though some have faced scrutiny for overpromising benefits. He signed a multiyear endorsement deal with Under Armour in 2010 as the brand's first NFL quarterback ambassador, promoting football cleats and apparel; this evolved into the launch of his signature Brady Brand line in 2022, featuring performance wear tested during his career. In January 2024, Brady merged his TB12 nutrition and Brady apparel brands with athletic training company Nobull, retaining operational control while expanding into functional fitness products; Nobull shuttered TB12's physical stores amid the integration.\n\nRecent partnerships include a June 2024 multiyear deal with quick-commerce platform Gopuff, involving investment and co-branded products like Goat Gummies, organic vegan snacks launched in June 2025 without artificial additives. In October 2025, Brady became global brand ambassador for SharkNinja, promoting appliances like the CRISPi PRO air fryer through social media campaigns referencing his career roasts. He joined robotic massage firm Aescape as chief innovation officer in October 2025, advocating AI-driven recovery tables for locker rooms and athletes, citing potential to reduce injury downtime based on his experience. Earlier endorsements encompassed luxury items like Aston Martin vehicles and IWC watches, as well as FTX cryptocurrency exchange (ended after its 2022 bankruptcy amid fraud allegations).\n\n### NFL Team Ownership Stake\n\nIn October 2024, NFL team owners unanimously approved Tom Brady's acquisition of a 5% minority stake in the Las Vegas Raiders, making him a limited partner in the franchise. The deal, initially agreed upon with principal owner Mark Davis in 2023, was valued at approximately US$220 million for a total 10% stake, with Brady personally holding 5% and his business partner, Tom Wagner, acquiring the remaining portion. Approval was delayed for over a year due to conflicts arising from Brady's role as lead color commentator for Fox Sports, which required league review under NFL ownership policies restricting broadcasting personnel from team equity.\n\nThe transaction positioned Brady as one of the few former players to gain an ownership interest in an NFL franchise post-retirement, though his minority share limits direct control over operations. Under a 2023 NFL rule prohibiting non-family member employees from holding team equity, the approval effectively barred Brady from any future playing eligibility. As of September 2025, Brady retained his 5% stake amid ongoing discussions of his advisory influence on team matters, including head coaching searches, though principal decisions remain with Davis.\n\n### Other Investments and Philanthropy\n\nBrady holds minority stakes in international sports franchises beyond his NFL involvement. In August 2023, he acquired a minority ownership interest in English soccer club Birmingham City F.C., partnering with Knighthead Capital Management; filings indicate he owns approximately 3.3% through 333 'B' shares, conferring no voting rights, while serving as chairman of the club's advisory board. The investment aligns with Knighthead's broader £25 million-plus commitment to the club, which achieved promotion in 2025 amid plans for a multi-use stadium on 48 acres of acquired land. Similarly, in 2023, Brady joined the ownership group of the WNBA's Las Vegas Aces, part of his expanding portfolio in women's professional basketball.\n\nBrady ventured into cryptocurrency with a high-profile endorsement deal with FTX in 2021, receiving approximately $30 million primarily in company stock for promotional services. The exchange's collapse in November 2022 amid fraud revelations rendered his stake worthless, resulting in a reported $30 million loss; subsequent lawsuits alleging undisclosed incentives were dismissed in May 2025. His real estate holdings, valued at around $26 million as of 2022, include properties in New York, Florida, and Montana, with a notable Miami mansion on Indian Creek Island purchased for $17 million in 2020; by February 2025, it attracted offers exceeding $150 million.\n\nIn philanthropy, Brady co-founded the TB12 Foundation in 2015 to promote health and wellness resources, particularly for athletes, though tax filings reveal limited direct charitable disbursements relative to assets raised. Critics, including analyses from CharityWatch, have scrutinized the foundation for directing substantial funds—over $1 million in some years—to Brady's for-profit TB12 entities rather than external causes, with overall giving from related vehicles like the Brady-Bündchen Foundation averaging under 0.1% of assets from 2007 to 2019. He has long supported Best Buddies International, serving as an ambassador since his college years and leveraging events for fundraising, though his personal Change the World Foundation has received payments from the organization amid questions of reciprocity. Specific donations include $100,000 to Hurricane Milton relief in October 2024, matched by apparel partner Fanatics.\n\n## Personal Life\n\n### Marriages, Divorce, and Family Dynamics\n\nBrady's first significant long-term relationship was with actress Bridget Moynahan, which began in early 2005 and ended in December 2006. Moynahan announced her pregnancy with Brady's child in February 2007, and their son, John \"Jack\" Edward Thomas Moynahan, was born on August 22, 2007, in Los Angeles; Brady attended the birth despite the prior breakup.  The pair established a co-parenting arrangement focused on Jack's well-being, with both emphasizing effective collaboration amid public scrutiny.\n\nBrady began dating supermodel Gisele Bündchen in late 2006, shortly after his split from Moynahan, and proposed in January 2009. They married on February 26, 2009, in a private ceremony at St. Thomas More Catholic Church in Santa Monica, California, followed by a larger event in Costa Rica. The couple welcomed son Benjamin Rein Brady on December 8, 2009, and daughter Vivian Lake Brady on December 5, 2012.  Bündchen also became a stepmother to Jack, integrating him into family activities despite occasional reported tensions over parenting approaches.\n\nAfter 13 years of marriage, Brady and Bündchen announced their divorce on October 28, 2022, filing jointly that day in Florida; the court dissolved the marriage immediately, citing it as \"irretrievably broken.\"  The split followed Brady's decision to unretire from the NFL in 2022, amid reported disagreements over career priorities and family time, though both parties described the process as amicable with a focus on protecting their children.\n\nPost-divorce, Brady and Bündchen share joint custody of Benjamin and Vivian, prioritizing open communication and the children's stability while residing separately—Brady in Florida and Bündchen primarily in Miami with occasional international travel.  Brady continues co-parenting Jack with Moynahan, often sharing public tributes to his eldest son, such as on Jack's 17th birthday in August 2024, highlighting their ongoing positive dynamic. Brady has publicly reflected on the challenges of balancing professional demands with fatherhood, admitting in 2025 that certain career choices, including participation in a Netflix roast, constituted a \"major f–k-up\" in prioritizing family.\n\n### Political Views and Public Stances\n\nTom Brady has consistently maintained a low profile on partisan politics throughout his career, avoiding formal endorsements of candidates and stating that he prefers to keep his views private to focus on football and avoid alienating diverse fanbases. In a 2022 interview, he emphasized separating personal friendships from political support, noting that \"political support is totally different than the support of a friend.\"\n\nBrady's most publicized political association stems from his longstanding personal friendship with Donald Trump, forged through shared golf interests dating back to the early 2000s. In September 2015, reporters photographed a red \"Make America Great Again\" hat in Brady's locker at Gillette Stadium, which Trump had autographed and sent as a gift during his presidential campaign launch. Brady confirmed ownership of the hat in a radio interview, describing Trump as \"a good friend\" and \"a hell of a lot of fun,\" but explicitly stated he had no intention of endorsing Trump's candidacy, attributing the hat's presence to a casual gesture from Robert Kraft. The incident drew scrutiny from media outlets and figures like actor Daniel Radcliffe, who criticized it publicly, though Brady reiterated his apolitical stance.\n\nAs speculation intensified during the 2016 election, Brady skipped a White House visit with the New England Patriots in 2017, citing family commitments, amid reports of tensions including his wife Gisele Bündchen's opposition to Trump. Trump later claimed in 2022 that he had advised Brady against endorsing him to protect his public image. By 2020, Brady affirmed on The Howard Stern Show that he had not communicated with Trump in \"a lot of years\" and reiterated his reluctance to engage in politics. No public records indicate significant political donations from Brady to candidates or PACs tied to presidential races.\n\nBrady has offered few statements on specific social or policy issues. In 2017, he expressed disagreement with Trump's criticism of NFL players kneeling during the national anthem, stating, \"I certainly disagree\" while advocating respect for differing views. He has not publicly articulated positions on topics such as abortion or gun rights, and searches of donation databases yield no verifiable contributions from him to advocacy groups on these matters. Post-retirement in 2023, Brady continued this pattern, with 2024-2025 reports noting unconfirmed speculation about conservative leanings based on his Florida residence and associations, but no explicit endorsements or statements emerged, including during events like a February 2025 appearance with House Speaker Mike Johnson.\n\n### Diet, Fitness Regimen, and Lifestyle Choices\n\nBrady adheres to the TB12 diet, a regimen he developed with body coach Alex Guerrero, which prioritizes anti-inflammatory, nutrient-dense foods to support longevity and performance. The plan follows an 80/20 rule, deriving approximately 80 percent of calories from plant-based sources such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds, while limiting animal products like lean meats, fish, and eggs to 20 percent. It excludes processed foods, trans fats, added sugars, refined carbohydrates, gluten, dairy, caffeine, and nightshade vegetables (including tomatoes, eggplants, white potatoes, and peppers) due to their purported inflammatory effects. Brady has stated that adopting this approach in his mid-20s, after experiencing physical decline, extended his career by reducing inflammation and improving recovery.\n\nTypical meals include smoothies with berries and nuts for breakfast, salads with olive oil dressing and limited protein for lunch, and dinners featuring quinoa, sweet potatoes, and greens; hydration emphasizes electrolyte-infused water, starting with 20 ounces upon waking. Supplements form a core component, with daily intake of electrolytes, trace minerals, a multivitamin, vitamin D, B-complex vitamins, antioxidants, fish oils, and plant-based protein powder to address potential nutrient gaps from restricted foods.\n\nBrady's fitness routine emphasizes pliability—long, stretchy muscle fibers—over maximal strength or hypertrophy, using resistance bands, bodyweight exercises, and light weights to minimize injury risk while maintaining functional power into his late 40s. A sample high-intensity session includes standing rows, banded push-ups, core rotations, deadlifts, bicep curls, tricep extensions, decelerating lunges, and squats, often performed in circuits. Post-retirement, he incorporates swimming circuits, such as four 100-meter freestyle laps followed by fast 25-meter sprints with recovery, and weighted step-ups with 35-pound dumbbells. Workouts typically occur from 8 to 10:30 a.m. after morning hydration and family breakfast, prioritizing recovery modalities like massage, vibration therapy, and adequate sleep.\n\nLifestyle choices reinforce these practices through structured daily habits, including early rising around 5:30-6:00 a.m., family-oriented meals, and mental conditioning via meditation or visualization to foster resilience. Brady avoids alcohol and tobacco, crediting holistic recovery—including chiropractic care and positive mindset—for defying age-related decline, as evidenced by his elite performance through age 45. These elements, detailed in his 2017 book *The TB12 Method*, reflect a causal focus on reducing bodily stress to sustain peak output, though self-reported via his branded platform.\n\n## Post-Retirement Activities\n\n### Broadcasting Role at Fox Sports\n\nIn May 2022, Tom Brady signed a 10-year contract with Fox Sports valued at $375 million to become the network's lead color analyst for NFL games following his retirement from playing. The agreement, announced while Brady was still active with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, positioned him to partner with play-by-play announcer Kevin Burkhardt in the top broadcast booth, succeeding Joe Buck and Troy Aikman who had departed for ESPN. Brady delayed his broadcasting debut after unretiring for the 2022 and 2023 seasons, officially beginning in the fall of 2024.\n\nBrady's first game call occurred on September 8, 2024, covering the Dallas Cowboys' 40-6 victory over the New Orleans Saints, where he provided analysis noted for its cautious tone and limited criticism of players. Early reviews described his delivery as stiff and lacking depth, with some observers pointing to rehearsed segments and minimal on-the-fly insight, though he showed flashes of quarterback expertise in situational breakdowns. By mid-season, select performances, such as the Cowboys-Lions matchup in October 2024, drew praise for improved engagement and analytical sharpness, indicating adaptation to the booth.\n\nDespite mixed feedback, Brady's presence correlated with Fox achieving record NFL viewership in 2024, including a 23% increase in regional window audiences compared to the prior year. Ongoing scrutiny persisted into 2025, with critics like Skip Bayless labeling his work \"underwhelming\" and broadcaster Dan Le Batard calling it \"distracting\" and insufficiently evolved after a year.  In November 2024, Fox executives reportedly urged adjustments to his commentary style to enhance candor and reduce perceived blandness.\n\nBrady's minority ownership stake in the Las Vegas Raiders, approved by the NFL in October 2023, introduces broadcasting constraints, including prohibitions on critiquing the team or participating in Raiders-related coverage to mitigate conflicts.  His agent affirmed in January 2025 that Brady intends to honor the full 10-year commitment, viewing the role as a long-term endeavor amid calls for refinement.\n\n### Competitive Pursuits and Exhibitions\n\nFollowing his retirement from the National Football League after the 2022 season, Tom Brady has participated in exhibition golf matches, leveraging his longstanding interest in the sport to compete against professional and celebrity opponents. In May 2025, Brady played a nine-hole match against country singer Morgan Wallen at the Troubadour Golf and Field Club in College Station, Texas, where he later described the experience as having his \"ass kicked\" in a lighthearted YouTube video recap. Earlier exhibitions include his involvement in Capital One's The Match series during his playing career, such as the 2020 event at Medalist Golf Club where he teamed with Phil Mickelson against Tiger Woods and Peyton Manning, but post-retirement appearances have extended this competitive outlet. An upcoming 12-hole exhibition in The Match format, announced in October 2025, pits Brady and Aaron Rodgers against Patrick Mahomes and Josh Allen, highlighting his continued pursuit of high-profile golf challenges.\n\nBrady has also returned to football in non-professional flag football tournaments, marking his first competitive gridiron action since retirement. In September 2025, he committed to the inaugural Fanatics Flag Football Classic, an all-star event featuring retired athletes, held as a showcase for the sport's growth. Additionally, Brady plans to compete in a three-team flag football tournament at Kingdom Arena in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, as part of the Riyadh Season entertainment series, alongside current and former NFL players; this event, announced in September 2025, represents his initial on-field football competition post-NFL. These pursuits underscore Brady's emphasis on maintaining competitive edge through varied athletic outlets, distinct from his professional career.\n\n### Recent Developments (2023-2025)\n\nIn September 2023, the New England Patriots organized a halftime tribute to Brady during their season-opening victory over the Philadelphia Eagles at Gillette Stadium, where he spoke to fans about his deep ties to the organization and received a warm reception from the crowd.\n\nBrady's induction into the Patriots Hall of Fame occurred on June 12, 2024, in an exclusive ceremony at Gillette Stadium attended by over 100 former teammates, coaches, and family members, including Bill Belichick and Robert Kraft; the event highlighted his role in securing six Super Bowl titles for the franchise and featured personal reflections from participants.\n\nThroughout 2025, Brady encountered criticism regarding conflicts of interest between his Fox Sports broadcasting duties and his minority ownership in the Las Vegas Raiders, with detractors arguing it could compromise his commentary objectivity, particularly amid reports of his advisory input to the Raiders; Brady rebutted these claims in September, attributing them to unfounded paranoia among league stakeholders.\n\nOn October 21, 2025, Brady entered a global brand ambassadorship with SharkNinja, Inc., launching with a promotional campaign for the Ninja CRISPi PRO air fryer that playfully invoked his prior Netflix roast to engage fans through social media contests.",
