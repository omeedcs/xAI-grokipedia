  "content": "# Timothée Chalamet\n\nTimothée Hal Chalamet (born December 27, 1995) is an American actor of French and Jewish descent. His mother, Nicole Flender, is a real estate broker from New York of Russian Jewish and Austrian Jewish ancestry, while his father, Marc Chalamet, is a French-born former UNICEF editor who relocated the family between New York and Paris during Chalamet's childhood. Chalamet achieved breakthrough recognition for his leading role as Elio Perlman in the coming-of-age film *Call Me by Your Name* (2017), earning an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor along with Golden Globe and BAFTA nods. He followed with the titular role of Paul Atreides in Denis Villeneuve's *Dune* (2021), securing a second Oscar nomination in the Best Actor category. In 2024, Chalamet portrayed a young Bob Dylan in *A Complete Unknown*, garnering another Best Actor Academy Award nomination and becoming one of the youngest actors to receive two such honors. His awards include a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role. Chalamet has maintained a relatively controversy-free public profile amid reports of occasional on-set tensions, such as alleged demanding behavior during the production of *A Complete Unknown*.\n\n## Early life\n\n### Family background and childhood\n\nTimothée Hal Chalamet was born on December 27, 1995, in Manhattan, New York City, to Nicole Flender and Marc Chalamet. His mother, Nicole Flender, is an American of Jewish descent with Austrian and Russian heritage; she trained as a professional dancer, performed on Broadway, and later worked as a real estate broker and actress. His father, Marc Chalamet, is French, born in Nîmes and raised in Lyon, where he pursued a career in journalism before editing for UNICEF.\n\nChalamet grew up alongside his older sister, Pauline Chalamet, born in 1992, who later pursued acting; the siblings were raised primarily in New York City, residing in the subsidized artists' housing complex Manhattan Plaza, which fostered an environment conducive to creative pursuits. The family spent summers in Lyon, France, to avoid Manhattan's heat, exposing Chalamet to bilingual influences from his father's heritage—he speaks French fluently and holds dual French-American citizenship.\n\nHis maternal grandparents contributed artistic lineages: grandfather Harold Flender was a comedy writer, filmmaker, and director, while grandmother Enid Lieberman was a professional dancer and choreographer. This heritage, combined with his parents' professions, immersed Chalamet in performing arts from an early age, though his immediate family emphasized education alongside creative encouragement.\n\n### Education and early interests\n\nChalamet attended elementary school at P.S. 87 in New York City, followed by Booker T. Washington Middle School, where he found the lack of creative outlets challenging. He later transferred to Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music \\u0026 Art and Performing Arts in Manhattan, a public institution emphasizing the arts that inspired the setting of the film *Fame*. At LaGuardia, Chalamet majored in drama and participated in school productions, including *The Trestle at PopeLick Creek* and *Prodigal Son*, the latter earning him recognition at the New York State High School Theatre Festival. He graduated in 2013, receiving the Drama Award for his contributions to theater.\n\nFollowing high school, Chalamet enrolled at Columbia University, studying cultural anthropology for one year before transferring to New York University's Gallatin School of Individualized Study. He completed only a semester or two at NYU before dropping out in 2014 to focus on acting opportunities, prioritizing professional auditions over formal higher education. This decision aligned with his growing professional momentum, including early television roles that demanded full-time commitment.\n\nChalamet's early interests centered on performance arts, influenced by his New York City upbringing in an artistic milieu, though he initially viewed acting as a precarious profession after observing struggling performers in his Hell's Kitchen neighborhood. Despite this, exposure to the city's theater scene—through family connections and urban proximity—fostered a passion for stage work, leading to childhood commercials and short films like *Sweet Tooth* and *Clown* by age 13. His high school theater involvement solidified this trajectory, with Chalamet later crediting LaGuardia's environment for nurturing his skills in improvisation and character development over structured academics. He also engaged in programs like YoungArts, which supported emerging talents in theater.\n\n## Career\n\n### Early roles and training (2008–2016)\n\nChalamet pursued formal acting training at Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music \\u0026 Art and Performing Arts in New York City, graduating in 2013. His admission was advocated by drama teacher Harry Shifman, who was impressed by Chalamet's audition despite initial reservations from the admissions panel. At LaGuardia, he trained in the Meisner technique and participated in school productions, including a lead role in *Sweet Charity*, though he lost the lead in *Hairspray* to classmate Ansel Elgort.  \n\nAs a child, Chalamet appeared in several commercials and debuted in two horror short films in 2008: *Sweet Tooth* (also titled *Butcher's Hill*), directed by Lance Edmands, and *Clown*, directed by Jon Keng. These early projects featured him in small, intense roles amid low-budget productions involving violence and supernatural elements.  \n\nHis television career began in 2009 with guest appearances, including a minor role in the TV movie *Loving Leah* and a substantial part in an episode of *Law \\u0026 Order*. That year, he also appeared in *Royal Pains* as Luke. Chalamet's first recurring role came in 2012 as Finn Walden, the son of the U.S. Vice President, in the Showtime series *Homeland*, appearing in eight episodes across seasons 2 and 3.  \n\nChalamet transitioned to feature films in 2014, debuting in Jason Reitman's ensemble comedy-drama *Men, Women \\u0026 Children* as Danny, a high school student navigating internet pornography and family dynamics. The same year, he played Tom Cooper, the teenage son of Matthew McConaughey's character, in Christopher Nolan's science fiction epic *Interstellar*. Additional supporting roles followed in 2015, including younger Stephen Elliott in *The Adderall Diaries* and the lead as Zac in the indie thriller *One and Two*. In 2016, he starred as Billy in the drama *Miss Stevens*, portraying a troubled high school student in a theater production. During this period, Chalamet also performed in New York theater, including John Patrick Shanley's *Prodigal Son* off-Broadway in 2016.\n\n### Breakthrough films (2017–2020)\n\nChalamet's breakthrough occurred in 2017 with the release of three films that showcased his range: *Hostiles*, *Lady Bird*, and *Call Me by Your Name*. In *Hostiles*, a Western directed by Scott Cooper, he played a small supporting role as Pvt. Philippe Dejardin, a French soldier, in a film that earned mixed reviews but highlighted his early versatility in period pieces. His supporting turn in Greta Gerwig's coming-of-age comedy *Lady Bird* as Kyle Scheible, an aloof intellectual high schooler, contributed to the film's critical acclaim, with audiences noting his portrayal of a self-absorbed yet charismatic \"fuckboy\" archetype that resonated in the ensemble. The film's 99% approval on Rotten Tomatoes underscored its reception, though Chalamet's role was brief.\n\nThe pivotal role came in Luca Guadagnino's *Call Me by Your Name*, where Chalamet starred as Elio Perlman, a 17-year-old discovering first love and sexuality during a 1980s Italian summer. Released on November 24, 2017, the film grossed $41.3 million worldwide on a €3.5 million budget, achieving the highest per-theater average opening of the year at $101,219. Chalamet's performance earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor, a rarity for a 22-year-old newcomer, along with a win for Best Male Lead at the Independent Spirit Awards and a Gotham Award for Breakthrough Actor. Critics praised his nuanced depiction of adolescent vulnerability, propelling him to stardom.\n\nIn 2018, Chalamet led in *Beautiful Boy*, directed by Félix van Groeningen, portraying Nic Sheff, a methamphetamine-addicted young man in a biographical drama opposite Steve Carell as his father. The film, released October 12, 2018, depicted the real-life struggles based on memoirs by Sheff and David Sheff, with Chalamet's raw, transformative performance earning a Golden Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actor and a Screen Actors Guild nomination in the same category. Reviewers highlighted his ability to convey addiction's toll, marking it as his most challenging role to date. He also appeared in the indie *Hot Summer Nights*, playing a drug-dealing teen in a 1990s-set coming-of-age story, which received limited release but added to his repertoire of youthful antiheroes.\n\nThe year 2019 saw Chalamet in Greta Gerwig's adaptation of *Little Women* as Theodore \"Laurie\" Laurence, the affluent neighbor and romantic interest to Jo March (Saoirse Ronan). Released December 25, 2019, the film grossed $218.8 million worldwide against a $40 million budget, bolstered by strong holiday performance including a $16.8 million domestic opening weekend. His charismatic, brooding portrayal of Laurie contributed to the ensemble's praise, though the film earned six Oscar nominations without wins for acting. Additionally, *A Rainy Day in New York*, a Woody Allen comedy where he played Gatsby Welles, faced delayed release due to controversy but premiered at festivals, showcasing his comedic timing in a New York-set romance. These roles solidified his transition from indie darling to versatile leading man by 2020, amid the COVID-19 disruptions limiting theatrical outputs.\n\n### Major projects and commercial success (2021–present)\n\nIn 2021, Chalamet starred as Paul Atreides in Denis Villeneuve's adaptation of Frank Herbert's *Dune*, portraying the young heir to House Atreides in a sci-fi epic involving interstellar politics and ecology. Released on October 22, 2021, the film earned $402 million worldwide against a $165 million budget, achieving profitability amid pandemic restrictions through hybrid theatrical-streaming on HBO Max.\n\nThat year, he appeared in Wes Anderson's anthology film *The French Dispatch* as Zeffirelli, a fictional painter, contributing to its stylized tribute to journalism with limited commercial impact. Chalamet also featured in Adam McKay's satirical comedy *Don't Look Up* as Yule, a tech billionaire, a Netflix release that garnered 152 million viewing hours in its first 28 days but minimal theatrical gross of under $1 million worldwide.\n\nIn 2022, Chalamet led Luca Guadagnino's horror romance *Bones and All* as Lee, a cannibalistic drifter alongside Taylor Russell, exploring themes of desire and deviance; the film grossed $15 million worldwide on a $16 million budget, succeeding modestly in niche markets.\n\nChalamet's 2023 portrayal of Willy Wonka in Paul King's musical prequel *Wonka* depicted the chocolatier's origin, blending whimsy and enterprise; it amassed $634 million globally from a $125 million budget, marking a family-oriented commercial triumph.\n\nThe 2024 sequel *Dune: Part Two* saw Chalamet reprise Paul Atreides, escalating the narrative of messianic prophecy and warfare, directed by Villeneuve; it grossed $714 million worldwide on a $190 million budget, becoming his highest-earning film and demonstrating franchise viability.\n\nIn James Mangold's 2024 biopic *A Complete Unknown*, Chalamet embodied Bob Dylan from 1961 to 1965, capturing the folk icon's rise through raw performances and vocal mimicry; the film earned $140 million worldwide, buoyed by awards buzz for its authentic depiction of Dylan's transformative era.\n\n## Acting approach and reception\n\n### Performance techniques and versatility\n\nChalamet's acting techniques draw from his training at Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music \\u0026 Art and Performing Arts, where he engaged with elements of the Meisner technique, emphasizing repetition exercises and reactive responses over premeditated actions. This foundation informs his preference for \"just being\" on set, minimizing artificial efforts to manufacture emotional peaks and instead prioritizing authentic, moment-to-moment interactions with co-actors and environment. He has cautioned against over-reliance on method acting, noting its risk of diverting focus from on-camera performance to off-camera immersion.\n\nFor demanding roles, however, Chalamet employs selective immersion; in preparing for Bob Dylan in *A Complete Unknown* (2024), he committed to five years of vocal and instrumental training, then maintained character isolation during the three-month shoot, with production call sheets listing him as \"Bob Dylan\" and barring visitors, friends, or representatives to preserve authenticity. Co-stars described this as \"relentless,\" enabling nuanced capture of Dylan's introspective demeanor without breaking immersion, though casual interactions occasionally risked disrupting his dialect.\n\nChalamet's versatility manifests in his navigation of disparate genres and character archetypes, blending emotional vulnerability with precise control to convey layered internal states through subtle physicality, silence, and stillness rather than overt histrionics. Early indie roles like the sexually awakening Elio in *Call Me by Your Name* (2017) highlighted his capacity for tender, unspoken longing, earning an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. This range extended to portraying addiction's toll in *Beautiful Boy* (2018), where he depicted raw familial fracture, and historical figures like a youthful Henry V in *The King* (2019), adapting Shakespearean command amid battlefield grit.\n\nIn blockbusters, he shifts to stoic heroism as Paul Atreides in *Dune* (2021) and its 2024 sequel, embodying prophetic destiny in vast sci-fi landscapes, while *Wonka* (2023) required whimsical invention in a musical origin story, demonstrating adaptability from introspective drama to high-stakes spectacle without diluting character depth. Critics attribute this breadth to his emphasis on adaptability as an actor's core strength, allowing instinctive risk-taking across indie intimacy and commercial scale.\n\n### Critical evaluations and debates\n\nChalamet's breakthrough role in *Call Me by Your Name* (2017) drew widespread praise for his naturalistic portrayal of adolescent desire and vulnerability, contributing to the film's 94% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes and his Academy Award nomination for Best Actor, though some reviewers noted his performance relied heavily on physical expressiveness over vocal depth. Subsequent roles in *Lady Bird* (2017) and *Beautiful Boy* (2018) solidified his reputation for emotive sensitivity, with critics like those at Gold Derby ranking them among his strongest for capturing quiet emotional turmoil, yet debates emerged over whether his appeal stemmed more from youthful allure than technical versatility.\n\nA persistent debate centers on nepotism's role in his ascent, amplified in January 2023 when his agent, Brian Swardstrom, revealed Chalamet \"hasn't auditioned for anything\" in over seven years, prompting accusations of unearned privilege tied to his family's entertainment ties—his mother, Nicole Flender, a former dancer and actress, and aunt, Amy Lippman, a television producer.  Defenders countered that early auditions, including rejections for *Manchester by the Sea* (2016), and consistent output demonstrate merit, with outlets like Quora users emphasizing his immersion in roles without high-level parental connections. This discourse reignited \"nepo baby\" discussions, contrasting his trajectory with actors lacking industry lineage, though empirical success in films like *Dune* (2021) suggested talent validation beyond access.\n\nCritics have questioned Chalamet's range, with online forums and polls labeling him overrated for repetitive \"brooding pretty boy\" archetypes, as in Reddit threads decrying \"phoned-in\" efforts outside *Dune*'s action context.  Conversely, recent performances in *A Complete Unknown* (2024) as Bob Dylan earned acclaim for transformative mimicry of mannerisms and vocals, with reviewers calling it \"immersive\" and streak-maintaining against prior skepticism. Early reactions to *Marty Supreme* (2025) similarly hailed it as \"career-best\" and \"electric,\" indicating evolving consensus on his adaptability in dramatic leads.  These divides highlight tensions between hype-driven fame and substantive skill, with box office draws like *Wonka* (2023) surprising detractors via untested musical chops despite mixed ensemble critiques.\n\n### Awards, nominations, and box office impact\n\nChalamet has garnered significant recognition for his performances, including two nominations for the Academy Award for Best Actor: first for portraying Elio Perlman in *Call Me by Your Name* (2017) at the 90th ceremony in 2018, and second for his role as Bob Dylan in *A Complete Unknown* (2024) at the 97th ceremony in 2025, making him the youngest actor nominated twice in the category since 1957. He received four Golden Globe Award nominations for Best Actor, including for *Call Me by Your Name*, *Beautiful Boy* (2018), *Wonka* (2023), and *A Complete Unknown*, though he has not won in this category. Chalamet earned four British Academy Film Award nominations, two for leading roles and two for supporting, and won a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role for *A Complete Unknown* at the 31st SAG Awards in 2025. Overall, as of February 2025, he has accumulated over 140 nominations and 41 wins across various awards bodies, including Critics' Choice and Independent Spirit Awards. He received a nomination for Best Actor for *Marty Supreme* (A24) at the 2026 Critics' Choice Awards.\n\n| Major Award | Nominations | Wins |\n|-------------|--------------|------|\n| Academy Awards (Best Actor) | 2 | 0 |\n| Golden Globe Awards (Best Actor – Drama/Musical/Comedy) | 4 | 0 |\n| British Academy Film Awards | 4 | 0 |\n| Screen Actors Guild Awards (Outstanding Actor) | Multiple | 1 (*A Complete Unknown*, 2025) |\n\nChalamet's films have demonstrated substantial box office performance, particularly in recent leading roles, contributing to a career worldwide gross exceeding $3 billion as of January 2025. His appearance in *Interstellar* (2014), though in a supporting capacity, was part of a film that earned $740.7 million globally. Starring roles in *Dune* (2021) generated $407.7 million, while *Dune: Part Two* (2024) achieved $714.4 million, bolstered by strong international appeal and franchise momentum. *Wonka* (2023), a musical prequel where he led as the titular character, grossed $634.4 million against a $125 million budget, marking a commercial hit during the post-pandemic recovery despite divided critical reception to his singing.\n\n*A Complete Unknown* added $100 million worldwide by February 2025, performing steadily amid awards buzz but facing competition from higher-budget releases. These successes, especially *Wonka* and *Dune: Part Two*, have positioned Chalamet as a reliable box office draw, with Variety noting they solidified his status as a major star capable of anchoring family-oriented and sci-fi blockbusters. Earlier indie films like *Call Me by Your Name* earned modest $41 million globally, highlighting a shift from critical acclaim to commercial viability in larger-scale productions.\n## Public persona\n\n### Fashion influence and red carpet presence\n\nTimothée Chalamet has emerged as a prominent figure in menswear, frequently collaborating with luxury brands such as Cartier, for which he serves as a global ambassador, and Chanel, appointing him as the face of Bleu de Chanel fragrance in 2023.  His partnerships extend to houses like Louis Vuitton, Prada, and Haider Ackermann, where he models custom pieces that blend tailored silhouettes with experimental elements, influencing perceptions of male elegance in contemporary fashion.  These associations have positioned him as a tastemaker, with fashion outlets crediting his selections for popularizing androgynous and avant-garde aesthetics among younger demographics.\n\nOn red carpets, Chalamet consistently opts for bold, non-conformist ensembles that challenge traditional tuxedo norms. At the 2019 Venice Film Festival premiere of *The King*, he wore a sleek, tailored suit emphasizing slim proportions. For the 2021 Venice International Film Festival, he appeared in a Haider Ackermann outfit noted for its minimalist yet striking design. In October 2019, at a London event, he donned a Louis Vuitton hoodie adorned with 3,000 Swarovski crystals and 15,000 sequins, exemplifying his affinity for embellished, youthful interpretations of formalwear. More recently, during the 2025 awards season for *A Complete Unknown*, he incorporated method dressing inspired by Bob Dylan, including a yellow leather Givenchy suit at the Oscars and a black leather ensemble with a neon green shirt at the SAG Awards, both referencing Dylan's 1960s style. \n\nChalamet's red carpet choices, such as floral Alexander McQueen suits, monochrome red outfits, and velvet jackets, have garnered attention for prioritizing self-expression over convention, contributing to discussions on evolving gender norms in fashion without adhering to rigid tailoring. His 2025 BAFTA appearance featured a cropped, double-breasted black Bottega Veneta suit, while earlier events like the 2025 Berlinale included head-to-toe soft pink attire for Valentine's Day.  Additionally, he has embraced denim-driven looks evoking Y2K aesthetics, as seen in recent premieres with brands like True Religion and Wrangler, signaling a shift toward personality-infused dressing. These selections, often custom-made by designers like Nahmias for both red carpets and casual appearances, underscore his role in broadening menswear boundaries.\n\n### Media scrutiny and cultural archetype\n\nChalamet has been portrayed in media as a departure from conventional Hollywood leading men, embodying an introspective and sensitive archetype often described as the \"soft boy\" or \"wiry boy-genius\" with emotional depth over physical dominance. This image, crystallized by his role as the vulnerable Elio in *Call Me by Your Name* (2017), positions him as a cultural touchstone for Gen Z audiences seeking authenticity amid performative masculinity, blending artistic vulnerability with subtle charisma. Critics note this persona challenges hyper-masculine norms, favoring nuanced emotional portrayals that resonate in indie-to-blockbuster transitions, though some analyses question if it risks typecasting him as perpetually youthful or effete.\n\nMedia scrutiny intensified around Chalamet's personal life, particularly his relationship with Kylie Jenner starting in 2023, which drew tabloid dissection of public interactions labeled \"cringe-worthy\" by outlets and fans, including awkward moments at events that fueled social media speculation. This focus amplified perceptions of an \"unlikely match,\" contrasting his curated indie image with Jenner's reality-TV persona, leading to debates on authenticity versus PR orchestration. Chalamet has critiqued such platforms himself, warning in a 2022 interview that social media's emphasis on judgment contributes to \"societal collapse\" by fostering relentless negativity toward young celebrities.\n\nFurther scrutiny emerged in 2025 over reports of lavish habits, such as private jet usage, prompting backlash for environmental hypocrisy amid celebrity privilege, with critics highlighting how such actions undermine his relatable everyman archetype. Despite this, Chalamet has maintained a relatively controversy-free public image by avoiding overt scandals and opting out of aggressive social media promotion, as seen in his rejection of a campaign for *A Complete Unknown* (2024), prioritizing substantive press over viral metrics. This strategic restraint, coupled with evolving perceptions from \"moody art-house boi\" to a more grounded \"bro\" figure, underscores ongoing tensions between his cultural idealization and real-world media pressures.\n\n## Personal life\n\n### Family dynamics and heritage\n\nTimothée Chalamet was born on December 27, 1995, in New York City to Nicole Flender, an American real estate broker and former dancer of Jewish ancestry, and Marc Chalamet, a French native from Nîmes who has worked in editorial roles for organizations including UNICEF and the United Nations. Flender's heritage traces to Russian Jewish and Austrian Jewish roots, while Marc Chalamet's background is French, contributing to Chalamet's dual American-French citizenship and bicultural identity. The family spent summers in Lyon, France, to escape New York heat, fostering Chalamet's fluency in French and exposure to both environments from childhood.\n\nChalamet was named after his maternal grandfather, Harold Flender, a Bronx-born Jewish writer known for works like the 1950 novel *The Sixth Winter*, which reflected mid-20th-century American Jewish experiences. Though raised with Jewish cultural ties through his mother—a third-generation New Yorker—Chalamet has described limited personal engagement with religious observance, emphasizing familial rather than doctrinal connections.\n\nHis older sister, Pauline Chalamet, born in January 1992, is an actress with credits including the series *Emily in Paris*; the siblings share a supportive bond, having grown up collaborating on childhood performances encouraged by their mother, who credited herself with \"planting seeds\" for their artistic pursuits. In September 2024, Pauline gave birth to a daughter, prompting Chalamet to express enthusiasm about his new role as an uncle. His parents have remained publicly supportive of his career, attending events like red carpet premieres despite the family's preference for privacy.\n\n### Romantic relationships and privacy\n\nChalamet began dating model Lourdes Leon in 2013 while both attended LaGuardia High School in New York City, though the relationship ended shortly thereafter amid limited public details. In 2018, he entered a relationship with actress Lily-Rose Depp, daughter of Johnny Depp and Vanessa Paradis, following their collaboration on the film *The King*; the couple was seen together publicly until their reported breakup in April 2020, with a brief rumored reconciliation in 2021.  Later that year, Chalamet was linked to Mexican actress Eiza González after they were photographed together in June 2020 during trips to Mexico and Malibu, but the romance concluded by October. \n\nBy April 2023, Chalamet started dating reality television personality Kylie Jenner, with initial sightings at events like the Jean-Paul Gaultier show in Paris confirming their connection; the pair has since maintained a low-profile dynamic despite occasional paparazzi captures and breakup rumors, remaining together as of August 2025 per insider reports.  Other associations, such as unconfirmed sightings with model Sarah Talabi in 2022, have surfaced in media speculation but lack substantiation beyond brief encounters.\n\nChalamet has consistently advocated for shielding his personal life from scrutiny, stating in a November 2023 GQ interview that pursuing privacy in relationships can lead to public misunderstanding, as \"sometimes, people are going to be hella confused when you say you're trying to live a private life.\"  This approach aligns with his limited commentary on partners, even high-profile ones like Jenner, whom he has not extensively discussed in interviews despite their joint appearances at events such as the Golden Globes in January 2024. Jenner's own emphasis on privacy reinforces this boundary, with her noting in 2024 that keeping their relationship out of the spotlight \"feels so good.\" Chalamet's reticence extends to avoiding social media disclosures, prioritizing discretion amid persistent tabloid interest fueled by his partners' fame.\n\n## Controversies and criticisms\n\n### On-set behavior allegations\n\nIn July 2024, anonymous crew members on the set of the Bob Dylan biopic *A Complete Unknown* alleged that Timothée Chalamet exhibited demanding and paranoid behavior during filming in Hoboken, New Jersey. Reports claimed he imposed strict rules, including prohibitions on eye contact or introductions from staff, and restricted cell phone use after a production assistant photographed him viewing a solar eclipse on April 8, 2024, prompting a strongly worded email to cast and crew. Additional accusations included Chalamet seizing a dedicated restroom trailer, which delayed facilities for approximately 120 background actors and over 150 crew members, as well as cursing at a production assistant, displaying \"frat-boy\" antics, and objecting to crew observing rehearsals or stand-in actors, allegedly contributing to production delays and extended 18-hour shifts.\n\nSources close to the production denied key elements of these claims, stating there was no formal \"no eye contact\" policy or instances of Chalamet ejecting personnel from set, attributing some restrictions to standard protections during active rehearsals or filming. They described cell phone bans near principal actors as routine industry practice and private restroom trailers for leads as commonplace to maintain continuity and privacy.\n\nIn December 2024, Chalamet and director James Mangold directly addressed related rumors of method acting excesses, with Chalamet rejecting assertions that he remained in character off-camera or demanded to be addressed as \"Bob\" Dylan, though he affirmed his six-year preparation and full commitment to the role without labeling it Method acting. Mangold defended such intensity as essential professional focus, criticizing media portrayals of dedication as obsession. Co-stars framed Chalamet's approach positively; Edward Norton described him as \"relentless\" in barring visitors, friends, or representatives to preserve immersion, while Elle Fanning praised the authentic blend of Chalamet's persona with Dylan's during musical scenes. No formal complaints or investigations into the alleged behavior have been reported, and subsequent cast testimonials emphasize Chalamet's work ethic over disruption.\n\n### Public statements and backlash\n\nIn October 2020, Chalamet used Instagram Stories to express strong opposition to then-President Donald Trump ahead of the U.S. presidential election, posting messages including \"vote that fucker out\" and encouraging followers to prioritize voting Trump out on November 3. These statements, shared directly by Chalamet to his millions of followers, elicited backlash from conservative commentators and Trump supporters, who criticized the language as crude and indicative of celebrity overreach into politics without substantive policy engagement. A resurfaced video of similar anti-Trump remarks in June 2025 reignited online debate, with some users accusing Chalamet of hypocrisy given his subsequent apolitical public stance.\n\nDuring his November 11, 2023, hosting stint on *Saturday Night Live*, Chalamet participated in a sketch with the comedy trio Please Don't Destroy, portraying an aspiring musician on a rooftop contemplating suicide who reveals his band's name as \"Hamas\" (pronounced \"Haymus,\" spelled H-A-M-A-S). The other characters react with horror, refusing to share his music on Instagram due to the name's association with the Palestinian militant group amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, which had already resulted in thousands of casualties. The skit prompted widespread backlash on social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter), where users labeled it \"vile,\" \"tone-deaf,\" and disrespectful to victims of the conflict, particularly in Gaza, with critics arguing it trivialized a humanitarian crisis involving over 4,000 children's deaths at the time. Pro-Palestinian advocates specifically condemned Chalamet and *SNL* writers for the timing, viewing the humor as punching down on the resistance group and ignoring the war's asymmetries, though defenders noted the coincidental pronunciation and intent as wordplay rather than endorsement of any side.\n\nIn January 2025, while hosting *SNL* again, Chalamet drew criticism for a monologue joke referencing former President Jimmy Carter's recent health issues and death, which some viewers deemed insensitive given Carter's age (100) and public service legacy. Accusations of poor taste surfaced online, with detractors arguing it exemplified *SNL*'s shift toward edgier, less empathetic humor under Chalamet's involvement, though others dismissed it as standard late-night satire. Chalamet has otherwise maintained a low profile on divisive issues post-2020, occasionally referencing influences like Bob Dylan in interviews to advocate wariness of \"savior-like figures\" or cult leaders without tying to specific events, avoiding further major controversies.",
