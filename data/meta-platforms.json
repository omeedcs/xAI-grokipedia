Formerly known as Facebook, Inc., the company rebranded to Meta in October 2021 to reflect its broader focus on building the \"metaverse,\" a virtual, interconnected digital environment. Meta is one of the world's largest and most influential technology companies, primarily known for its social networking platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, as well as its ventures into virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) through products like the Meta Quest headset [Meta Official Site](https://about.meta.com/).\n\nMeta's mission is to \"give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together,\" though its evolution into the metaverse signals a shift toward immersive digital experiences. The company operates a vast ecosystem of services and technologies, impacting billions of users globally and playing a significant role in digital communication, advertising, and emerging tech industries [Meta Mission Statement](https://about.meta.com/company-info/).\n\n## Historical Background\n\nMeta Platforms traces its origins to the creation of Facebook, a social networking platform founded by Mark Zuckerberg along with fellow Harvard University students Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes. Launched on February 4, 2004, as \"TheFacebook,\" the platform initially targeted college students before expanding to a broader audience. By 2006, it became accessible to anyone over the age of 13 with a valid email address [Facebook History](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Facebook).\n\nKey milestones in the company's history include:\n\n- **2007**: Introduction of the Facebook Platform, allowing third-party developers to create applications for the site, significantly boosting its growth.\n- **2009**: Facebook surpassed MySpace as the leading social networking site, marking its dominance in the industry.\n- **2012**: Acquisition of Instagram for $1 billion, a photo-sharing app that became a cornerstone of Meta's portfolio [Instagram Acquisition](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/10/technology/facebook-to-buy-instagram-for-1-billion.html).\n- **2014**: Purchase of WhatsApp for $19 billion, expanding Meta's reach into global messaging services [WhatsApp Acquisition](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-26266689).\n- **2016**: Acquisition of Oculus VR for $2 billion, signaling Meta's early interest in virtual reality technologies [Oculus Acquisition](https://www.theverge.com/2014/3/25/5547456/facebook-buys-oculus-vr-for-2-billion).\n- **2021**: Rebranding from Facebook, Inc. to Meta Platforms, Inc., reflecting a strategic pivot toward the metaverse, a concept involving interconnected virtual spaces for social interaction, work, and entertainment [Meta Rebranding](https://www.reuters.com/technology/facebook-changes-its-name-meta-bid-build-metaverse-2021-10-28/).\n\nThroughout its history, Meta has faced significant controversies, including privacy scandals like the 2018 Cambridge Analytica incident, where user data was misused for political advertising. These events have shaped public perception and led to increased regulatory scrutiny worldwide [Cambridge Analytica Scandal](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/17/cambridge-analytica-facebook-influence-us-election).\n\n## Current Status and Relevance\n\nAs of 2023, Meta Platforms remains a dominant force in the technology and social media sectors. The company reports over 3.9 billion monthly active users across its family of apps (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger), making it one of the most widely used digital platforms globally [Meta Q2 2023 Earnings](https://investor.fb.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2023/Meta-Reports-Second-Quarter-2023-Results/default.aspx). Its advertising business generates the majority of its revenue, with billions of dollars earned annually from targeted ads based on user data.\n\nMeta's relevance extends beyond social media into emerging technologies. The company is heavily investing in the metaverse, with initiatives like Horizon Worlds, a virtual reality social platform, and the Meta Quest series of VR headsets. However, these ventures have faced challenges, including significant financial losses in the Reality Labs division, which focuses on VR and AR development [Reality Labs Losses](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/01/meta-lost-13point7-billion-on-metaverse-initiative-in-2022.html).\n\nAdditionally, Meta is navigating complex regulatory environments. Governments worldwide, including the European Union and the United States, are scrutinizing its data practices, market dominance, and potential antitrust violations. The outcomes of these investigations could reshape Meta's operations and influence the broader tech industry [EU Regulatory Scrutiny](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_22_7723).\n\n## Notable Facts and Details\n\n- **User Base**: Facebook alone has over 3 billion monthly active users as of 2023, making it the largest social network in the world [Statista User Stats](https://www.statista.com/statistics/264810/number-of-monthly-active-facebook-users-worldwide/).\n- **Revenue**: In 2022, Meta generated $116.6 billion in revenue, primarily from advertising, though it reported a net income decline due to metaverse investments [Meta 2022 Annual Report](https://investor.fb.com/financials/default.aspx).\n- **Workforce**: Meta employs over 66,000 people globally, though it has undergone layoffs in recent years as part of cost-cutting measures [Meta Layoffs](https://www.reuters.com/technology/meta-lay-off-11000-employees-largest-job-cut-2022-11-09/).\n- **Controversies**: Beyond Cambridge Analytica, Meta has been criticized for its role in spreading misinformation, particularly during elections, and for its handling of user privacy.
