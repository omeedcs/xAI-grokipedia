**/Film** (stylized as /Film and also known as *SlashFilm*) is an American digital media outlet specializing in film and television coverage, including news, reviews, trailers, interviews, and feature articles.  
Founded in August 2005 by Peter Sciretta as a personal blog dedicated to movie news and commentary, /Film quickly expanded into a comprehensive entertainment resource, attracting a wide audience through its timely reporting and critical analysis.  
In 2021, the site was acquired by Static Media Inc., a Delaware-based digital publishing company established in 2012 and backed by private equity firm Novacap, which has since integrated /Film into its portfolio of over two dozen brands focused on entertainment, lifestyle, and technology.  
Under Static Media's ownership, /Film continues to produce original content, including the long-running podcast */Film Weekly*, hosted by editors such as Ben Pearson, which discusses current films, television, and industry trends.  
The publication emphasizes a mix of mainstream blockbusters from studios like Marvel and Disney, independent cinema, classic Hollywood retrospectives, and pop culture intersections, positioning itself as a trusted voice in the "reel world" for over two decades.

## History

### Founding

/Film was founded by Peter Sciretta on August 23, 2005, as an independent movie blog dedicated to providing in-depth coverage of filmmaking, news, and discussions for film enthusiasts. Sciretta, a film journalist based in San Francisco, launched the site shortly after concluding his full-time role as a writer for Cinematical, an AOL-owned movie blog, seeking to create a personal platform that reflected his passion for cinema without corporate constraints. The inaugural post, contributed by guest writer Zach Lawrence, featured a list of his top 10 films of all time, setting the tone for a community-driven approach to film discourse.

From its inception, /Film operated as a solo endeavor by Sciretta, who dedicated significant time to content creation in the first five years, driven by a desire to offer unique perspectives and rigorous research on movies and filmmakers. The blog quickly expanded by assembling a team of more than 20 bloggers from across the United States within its first month, fostering collaborative contributions that emphasized behind-the-scenes insights and critical analysis over mainstream summaries. This grassroots growth transformed /Film from a modest personal project into a prominent voice in online film journalism, prioritizing accessibility for movie buffs while avoiding the sensationalism common in early 2000s entertainment media.

Sciretta's vision for /Film was rooted in his lifelong enthusiasm for films, aiming to build a space where enthusiasts could engage deeply with the craft of filmmaking. Unlike established outlets, the site focused on original angles, such as exclusive interviews and speculative features on upcoming projects, which helped it carve a niche in the burgeoning blogosphere of the mid-2000s. By emphasizing quality over quantity, /Film's founding principles laid the groundwork for its evolution into a multimedia entertainment brand, though Sciretta initially never anticipated such scale.

### Expansion and ownership changes

Following its launch in 2005 as a personal blog dedicated to film news and commentary, /Film rapidly expanded its scope and reach, evolving into a comprehensive entertainment platform. The site incorporated multimedia elements, including podcasts starting in the late 2000s, video content on YouTube, and interactive features on Snapchat, which broadened its audience engagement beyond traditional articles. By 2021, /Film had achieved significant scale, attracting approximately 25 million monthly users across its digital properties and earning recognition as an approved critic source by Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic.

This period of growth also saw /Film establish a reputation for in-depth coverage of major industry events, such as the Toronto International Film Festival and San Diego Comic-Con, alongside exclusive interviews with filmmakers and actors, solidifying its influence in online film journalism. The expansion included building a diverse editorial team to handle increased output, focusing on timely reviews, trailers, and analysis that catered to a global audience of movie enthusiasts.

In terms of ownership, /Film operated independently under founder Peter Sciretta until 2021, when it was acquired by Static Media, an Indianapolis-based digital publishing network specializing in lifestyle and entertainment brands. The acquisition integrated /Film into Static Media's portfolio, which includes over two dozen sites like The List and Tasting Table, providing resources for further content development while maintaining its core focus on film and television. This shift marked a pivotal change, transitioning the site from a founder-led venture to part of a larger media conglomerate. Sciretta continued in an editorial role post-acquisition but stepped down from /Film on May 25, 2023, after nearly 18 years with the site.

### Podcasts

/Film has produced several podcasts over the years, focusing on film and television news, reviews, interviews, and discussions. The site's primary audio offerings have evolved, starting with a flagship show in the late 2000s and expanding to daily and weekly formats in the 2010s. These podcasts feature contributions from /Film's editorial team, including founder Peter Sciretta, and have helped extend the site's reach through in-depth conversations with filmmakers, actors, and industry insiders.

The earliest major podcast associated with /Film was The /Filmcast, launched in 2009 at the invitation of founder Peter Sciretta to provide audio content for the website. Hosted initially by Sciretta and later by a rotating group including Devindra Hardawar, Jeff Cannata, and others, it ran weekly for over 12 years, covering new releases, box office analysis, and geek culture topics. Episodes often included segments like "What We Watched," "Box Office Breakdown," and listener voicemails, fostering a conversational tone among the hosts. In 2021, the podcast spun off as an independent entity renamed The Filmcast. The separation allowed greater creative freedom while maintaining occasional crossovers with /Film staff, with episodes continuing weekly at thefilmcast.com.

In 2017, /Film introduced /Film Daily on July 10, a weekday podcast that delivers timely discussions on breaking movie and TV news, deeper dives into trailers and announcements, and casual "water cooler" chats among staff. Hosted by editors like Ben Pearson, Peter Sciretta, and contributors such as Jacob Hall and Chris Evangelista, it emphasizes quick, engaging takes on current events, often featuring interviews with directors and actors. For example, episodes have included exclusive talks with showrunners like Tony Gilroy about *Andor* and authors like Kyle Buchanan on the making of *Mad Max: Fury Road*. As of late 2024, /Film Daily had released over 1,700 episodes; as of November 2025, it has over 2,000 episodes.

Complementing the daily format, /Film Weekly debuted on June 27, 2017, offering a more structured weekly roundup of film and TV developments, spoiler-filled reviews, and high-to-low rankings of recent releases. Primarily hosted by Ben Pearson and Peter Sciretta, with guest appearances from the broader team, it has produced over 430 episodes as of November 2025, covering topics from major festival premieres like SXSW to analyses of franchises such as *The Conjuring*. Notable segments include news recaps, interviews (e.g., with screenwriters like Jesse Wigutow on *Tron: Ares*), and thematic discussions, such as the best movie moments of a given year. The podcast's longevity reflects /Film's commitment to accessible, editor-driven commentary.

These podcasts have collectively amplified /Film's voice in online film discourse, blending journalistic insight with enthusiast passion. While The /Filmcast's independence marked a shift, /Film Daily and /Film Weekly continue to anchor the site's audio content, available across platforms like Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and YouTube.
