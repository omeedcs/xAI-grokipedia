## Historical Background
Pfizer was founded by Charles Pfizer and Charles F. Erhart, two German-American cousins, in Brooklyn, New York, in 1849. Initially, the company produced a parasitic treatment called santonin, which was a commercial success. During the American Civil War (1861–1865), Pfizer supplied critical medical supplies to the Union Army, establishing its reputation as a reliable pharmaceutical provider [History of Pfizer](https://www.pfizer.com/about/history).

- **Early 20th Century**: Pfizer became a pioneer in industrial fermentation, a technique used to mass-produce penicillin during World War II. This effort was crucial in treating wounded soldiers and cemented Pfizer’s role in global healthcare [National WWII Museum](https://www.nationalww2museum.org/war/articles/penicillin-wonder-drug-world-war-ii).
- **Post-War Expansion**: In the 1950s and 1960s, Pfizer expanded internationally, establishing operations in Europe, Asia, and Latin America. It also diversified its product line to include vaccines and consumer health products.
- **Modern Era**: The late 20th century saw Pfizer launch blockbuster drugs like Viagra (sildenafil) in 1998 for erectile dysfunction, which became one of the most recognized pharmaceutical brands worldwide [BBC on Viagra](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-46126025). In 2000, Pfizer merged with Warner-Lambert, and in 2009, it acquired Wyeth, significantly expanding its research capabilities and product portfolio [Reuters on Wyeth Acquisition](https://www.reuters.com/article/business/pfizer-to-buy-wyeth-for-68-billion-idUSTRE50P2ZC20090126).

## Current Status and Relevance
As of 2023, Pfizer remains a leader in the pharmaceutical industry, with reported revenues of over $100 billion in 2022, driven largely by its COVID-19 vaccine, Comirnaty, and antiviral treatment, Paxlovid [Pfizer Annual Report 2022](https://www.pfizer.com/investors/financials/annual-reports). The company continues to invest heavily in research and development (R&D), spending approximately $11.4 billion in 2022 on innovative therapies and vaccines.

Pfizer’s relevance in global health is underscored by its role during the COVID-19 pandemic. Partnering with BioNTech, a German biotechnology company, Pfizer developed Comirnaty, one of the first mRNA-based vaccines authorized for emergency use. This vaccine has been administered to billions of people worldwide, playing a critical role in mitigating the spread of the virus [WHO on COVID-19 Vaccines](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/covid-19-vaccines).

Beyond infectious diseases, Pfizer is also advancing treatments in oncology, with drugs like Ibrance for breast cancer, and in rare diseases, following its acquisition of companies like Biohaven Pharmaceuticals in 2022 for migraine treatments [CNBC on Biohaven Acquisition](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/10/pfizer-to-acquire-biohaven-pharmaceuticals-for-11point6-billion.html).

However, Pfizer has faced criticism over drug pricing, patent practices, and legal settlements. For instance, it has been scrutinized for high prices of essential medications in the U.S. and for past marketing practices that led to significant fines, such as a $2.3 billion settlement in 2009 for illegal drug promotion [U.S. Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-largest-health-care-fraud-settlement-its-history).
