# Neymar

Neymar da Silva Santos Júnior (born 5 February 1992) is a Brazilian professional footballer who plays as a forward for Santos FC and captains the Brazil national team. Emerging from Santos' youth academy, he debuted professionally at age 17 and rose to prominence with exceptional dribbling, vision, and goal-scoring prowess, amassing over 400 club goals and becoming Brazil's all-time leading international scorer with 79 goals in 127 appearances. His career highlights include winning the UEFA Champions League in 2015 with FC Barcelona as part of the famed MSN trio, two La Liga titles, five Ligue 1 titles with Paris Saint-Germain, and an Olympic gold medal with Brazil in 2016, alongside individual honors such as the FIFA Puskás Award and multiple top scorer accolades. Despite these accomplishments, Neymar's trajectory has been significantly impeded by chronic injuries—exacerbated by an injury-prone physique and demanding playstyle—resulting in extended absences, including over 741 days missed at PSG alone, and a reputation for on-pitch simulation that has fueled debates about his professionalism. Off-field controversies, including legal disputes over transfers, allegations of misconduct dismissed in court, and a lifestyle marked by high-profile partying, have further complicated his legacy, preventing him from fully realizing expectations as a Ballon d'Or contender or World Cup champion with Brazil. In 2025, after a brief and injury-plagued stint at Al-Hilal, he returned to Santos on a contract until year-end, aiming to rebuild form amid ongoing fitness challenges.

## Early life and youth career

### Early life

Neymar da Silva Santos Júnior was born on 5 February 1992 in Mogi das Cruzes, a municipality in the state of São Paulo, Brazil. His father, Neymar Santos Sr., was a former professional footballer who transitioned into various jobs, including as a salesman and cook, after retiring early from the sport due to injuries. His mother, Nadine da Silva, managed the household amid financial struggles that marked the family's early years. Neymar has a younger sister, Rafaella Santos, born in 1996.

The family faced significant economic hardship, frequently lacking resources for basic needs such as food, with Neymar later describing childhood memories of wanting simple items like cookies but being unable to afford them. They relocated several times during his infancy and early childhood, moving from Mogi das Cruzes to coastal areas including São Vicente and eventually Praia Grande, where they lived in a low-income neighborhood adjacent to an old garbage dump until around 2008. These circumstances, characterized by poverty in Brazil's favelas and working-class enclaves, instilled a strong motivation for success, as Neymar has attributed his drive partly to overcoming such deprivation.

From a young age, Neymar displayed a natural aptitude for football, playing street games and futsal in these environments, with his father providing initial guidance influenced by Brazil's improvisational "ginga" style. By age three, he exhibited exceptional agility and passion for the ball, though formal training began later in local settings before organized youth clubs.

### Youth development at Santos

Neymar joined the Santos FC youth academy in 2003 at the age of 11, after being spotted through local futsal play and offered a contract by the club. His family relocated from Mogi das Cruzes to Praia Grande, near Santos, to support his training, reflecting the club's emphasis on nurturing local talent akin to its history with players like Pelé. At the academy, Neymar trained at facilities including the CT Rei Pelé and later the Vila Belmiro youth center, focusing on technical skills influenced by his prior futsal experience at Gremetal, which honed his close control, dribbling, and improvisation.

Under coaches such as Betinho, who had guided him in early futsal, Neymar progressed rapidly through the under-13 and under-15 ranks, standing out for his speed, vision, and flair in matches against regional rivals. In 2006, at age 14, he traveled to Spain for tryouts with Real Madrid but opted to remain with Santos, prioritizing continued development in Brazil's youth system over an early European move. His training regimen emphasized ball mastery and tactical awareness, contributing to Santos' reputation for producing creative attackers, though the academy's methods drew occasional criticism for prioritizing individual skill over defensive discipline.

Neymar competed in youth competitions, including two editions of the Junior São Paulo Cup, where his performances showcased goal-scoring ability and playmaking, leading to his promotion to the senior squad in 2009 ahead of his professional debut. During this period, scouts like Zito, a Pelé-era veteran, highlighted his potential as a generational talent, though his progress was self-driven amid the academy's competitive environment rather than reliant on structured metrics. By 2009, at 17, Neymar had matured into a versatile forward, credited with elevating Santos' youth output, though exact goal tallies from under-17 levels remain undocumented in primary records.

## Club career

### Santos FC (2009–2013)

Neymar made his professional debut for Santos FC on 7 March 2009, at age 17, substituting in the final 30 minutes of a 2–1 Campeonato Paulista victory over Oeste. He quickly established himself in the first team, contributing to Santos' improved performances amid financial challenges.

In 2010, Neymar played a pivotal role in Santos' double triumph, scoring key goals in the Campeonato Paulista win and the Copa do Brasil final against Vitória on 26 July, where his contributions helped secure a 3–2 aggregate victory. His flair and goal-scoring propelled Santos to these titles, marking the club's first major successes since 2004.

The 2011 season saw Neymar lead Santos to the Copa Libertadores, culminating in a 2–1 second-leg victory over Peñarol on 22 June in the final at Pacaembu Stadium, ending a 48-year drought for the club; he scored the decisive goal in the 68th minute after an earlier penalty miss. Santos also retained the Campeonato Paulista that year.

Neymar's form continued in 2012, with Santos winning the Recopa Sudamericana against Universidad de Chile and another Campeonato Paulista, where he scored 20 goals and earned Best Player honors. Over his Santos tenure from 2009 to 2013, he netted over 100 goals in senior matches, drawing interest from European clubs.

On 3 June 2013, Neymar completed a transfer to FC Barcelona for a reported €57 million, concluding his time at Santos after helping secure six titles overall.

### FC Barcelona (2013–2017)

Neymar transferred to FC Barcelona from Santos FC in June 2013 for an officially reported fee of €57.1 million, though subsequent disclosures revealed the total cost exceeded €100 million, including €40 million paid directly to Neymar's father and prior bonuses to Santos totaling around €10 million. The deal involved complex third-party ownership arrangements, later sparking legal disputes in Spain where Barcelona was fined €5.5 million and banned from transfers for a year in 2016 for irregularities in priority rights payments. He made his competitive debut on August 18, 2013, as a substitute in a 1–1 La Liga draw against Levante, and scored his first goal for the club on August 21, 2013, in the Supercopa de España second leg against Atlético Madrid.

Neymar quickly integrated into Barcelona's attacking trio, known as MSN, alongside Lionel Messi and Luis Suárez, which collectively scored 364 goals over three seasons from 2014 to 2017. In his debut 2013–14 season, he recorded 15 goals and 11 assists in 45 appearances across all competitions, helping Barcelona finish second in La Liga while adapting to the team's possession-based style under Gerardo Martino and later Luis Enrique. His performance peaked in 2014–15, with 39 goals and 11 assists in 51 matches, including 10 goals in the UEFA Champions League—tying for the competition's top scorer—and key contributions in the treble-winning campaign of La Liga, Copa del Rey, and Champions League.

Over four seasons, Neymar amassed 105 goals and 58 assists in 186 appearances, ranking third among Brazilian players in Barcelona's all-time scoring list. He won two La Liga titles (2014–15, 2015–16), one UEFA Champions League (2014–15), three Copa del Rey trophies (2014–15, 2015–16, 2016–17), and two Supercopa de España titles (2013, 2016). In 2016–17, despite 20 goals in 46 games, tensions arose over his role behind Messi, culminating in his €222 million transfer to Paris Saint-Germain on August 3, 2017, activating his release clause and setting a world record fee at the time. The move followed Barcelona's elimination by PSG in the Champions League that year, where Neymar's standout performances highlighted his ambitions beyond a supporting role.

### Paris Saint-Germain (2017–2023)

Neymar transferred to Paris Saint-Germain from FC Barcelona on August 3, 2017, for a world-record transfer fee of €222 million, activated via his release clause. He signed a five-year contract and was unveiled at the Parc des Princes shortly after. In his competitive debut on August 13, 2017, against Guingamp in Ligue 1, Neymar scored once and provided one assist in a 3-0 victory. His home debut followed on August 20, 2017, versus Toulouse, where he scored two goals and delivered two assists in a 6-2 win.  

During his debut 2017-18 season, Neymar contributed 28 goals and 17 assists across 30 matches before a metatarsal fracture sidelined him for three months, limiting his appearances to 20 in Ligue 1. PSG secured the Ligue 1 title that year, with Neymar playing a key role in their domestic dominance despite a Champions League exit in the Round of 16 to Real Madrid. He repeated this success in 2018-19, winning another Ligue 1 title, though another metatarsal injury from January to April 2019 caused him to miss 18 games.  

Neymar's tenure featured partnerships with Kylian Mbappé and, from 2021, Lionel Messi, forming a potent attacking trio that propelled PSG to the 2020 Champions League final—the club's first ever—though they lost 1-0 to Bayern Munich. Over six seasons, he won five Ligue 1 titles (2018, 2019, 2020, 2022, 2023) and four French Super Cups (2017, 2019, 2020, 2022). However, persistent injuries hampered consistency, including ankle issues in 2021-22 (77 days missed) and multiple adductor and foot problems, leading to over 500 days sidelined across his PSG career.  

In total, Neymar made 173 appearances for PSG across all competitions, scoring 118 goals and providing 79 assists. In Ligue 1 specifically, he recorded 82 goals and 48 assists in 112 matches. His departure occurred in August 2023, when PSG sold him to Al-Hilal for €90 million amid ongoing injury concerns and contract disputes.  

### Al-Hilal (2023–2025)

Neymar transferred to Al-Hilal from Paris Saint-Germain on 15 August 2023 for a reported €90 million fee, signing a two-year contract that positioned him among the highest-paid footballers globally, with estimates of annual earnings exceeding $100 million including bonuses.  
He debuted for Al-Hilal on 19 August 2023 in a 2–0 Saudi Pro League win over Al-Ettifaq, providing an assist, and featured in five competitive matches before sustaining a severe injury.  
On 17 October 2023, during a Brazil national team match against Uruguay, Neymar ruptured his left anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and meniscus, requiring surgery and an extended recovery period of over a year.  
This injury limited him to just seven total appearances for Al-Hilal across all competitions, during which he scored one goal and recorded three assists in 428 minutes played.  
Neymar returned to competitive action on 21 October 2024, substituting in a Saudi Pro League match against Al-Akhdoud, but suffered a hamstring injury in his subsequent appearance on 4 November 2024, sidelining him for an additional four to six weeks.  
Amid ongoing fitness concerns and limited contributions, Al-Hilal mutually terminated Neymar's contract on 27 January 2025, allowing his free transfer back to Santos FC; reports indicated he forfeited approximately $71 million in remaining wages.

### Return to Santos FC (2025–present)

Following the early termination of his contract with Al-Hilal amid prolonged injury absences, Neymar rejoined Santos FC, his formative club, on January 31, 2025, initially on a short-term agreement until mid-year. The move represented a sentimental return to Brazilian football for the 33-year-old winger, who had debuted professionally with Santos in 2009.  

Neymar featured in 13 Série A matches during the 2025 season, contributing 3 goals and several assists while accumulating approximately 981 minutes of play. His output included notable moments such as assists and goals in key fixtures, though his influence was hampered by recurrent fitness setbacks. On June 24, 2025, Santos announced a contract extension with Neymar through December 31, 2025, securing his services until the conclusion of the Brasileirão campaign.  

However, Neymar's tenure has been marred by multiple injuries, including a hamstring strain requiring 40 days of absence, a muscle edema in his right thigh in August, and a subsequent thigh injury in September that sidelined him until at least November. These issues have led to him missing 47% of Santos' matches in 2025, raising doubts about his long-term durability. As of October 2025, club officials paused extension discussions beyond December, citing concerns over his physical condition and salary demands. This uncertainty coincides with speculation linking Neymar to potential moves, including Major League Soccer, as he approaches free agency in 2026.

## International career

### Youth and early senior appearances (2009–2012)

Neymar represented Brazil at the FIFA U-17 World Cup in Nigeria in 2009, where his performances as a 17-year-old forward drew international attention for his dribbling and flair, helping Brazil advance before their quarter-final exit to Italy.

On 10 August 2010, Neymar made his senior international debut for Brazil in a friendly match against the United States in New Jersey, entering as a substitute and scoring the winning goal in a 2–0 victory, marking him as the youngest Brazilian scorer since Ronaldo in 1994. He featured in four friendlies that year, scoring twice more against Iran and Argentina.

Neymar was included in Brazil's squad for the 2011 Copa América in Argentina under coach Mano Menezes, starting all three group-stage matches against Venezuela, Paraguay, and Ecuador, where he recorded no goals but contributed to Brazil's progression with his playmaking amid a team total of five goals. Brazil exited in the quarter-finals with a 0–0 draw against Paraguay, lost 2–0 on penalties, prompting criticism of the squad's overreliance on young talents like Neymar without sufficient defensive structure.

In 2012, Neymar captained Brazil's U-23 Olympic team at the London Games, scoring three goals across six matches—including a curling free-kick in the 3–1 group-stage win over Belarus—and providing an assist in the semi-final against South Korea, as Brazil secured the silver medal after a 1–2 final loss to Mexico on 11 August. Between senior friendlies and the Olympics, he added four more international goals that year, solidifying his role as Brazil's emerging star.

### Breakthrough and captaincy (2013–2016)

Neymar's international breakthrough came during the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup hosted by Brazil, where he scored four goals across five matches, including one in the 3–0 final victory over Spain on June 30, 2013. His contributions, combining goals with key assists, earned him the tournament's most valuable player award and helped Brazil secure their third Confederations Cup title.

In the 2014 FIFA World Cup on home soil, Neymar scored four goals in four matches, including two against Croatia in the opener on June 12, 2014, and one each versus Mexico and Cameroon. However, his tournament ended prematurely after suffering a fractured vertebra from a knee to the back by Colombia's Juan Camilo Zúñiga during the quarterfinal on July 4, 2014, sidelining him for Brazil's 7–1 semifinal loss to Germany and the third-place match.

Following the World Cup, Brazil coach Dunga appointed Neymar as national team captain on September 4, 2014, succeeding Thiago Silva for upcoming friendlies and qualifiers. This role extended to the 2015 Copa América in Chile, though his participation was limited; he scored in a 2–1 group win over Peru on June 14, 2015, but received a red card in the next match against Colombia on June 17, resulting in a four-game suspension that excluded him from the quarterfinal loss to Paraguay on penalties. Brazil exited in the quarterfinals without advancing further, marking a disappointing campaign.

Neymar captained Brazil's Olympic team at the 2016 Rio Games, leading them to their first men's football gold medal with a 1–0 extra-time semifinal win over Honduras and a 1–1 draw resolved by 5–4 penalty shootout victory over Germany in the final on August 20, 2016, where he converted the decisive penalty and scored the semifinal opener. His leadership and four goals in six matches redeemed Brazil's prior Olympic failures and fulfilled national expectations as host. Following the triumph, Neymar announced he would relinquish the captaincy.

### Major tournaments and records (2018–present)

In the 2018 FIFA World Cup held in Russia, Neymar featured in five matches for Brazil, who advanced to the quarterfinals before a 2–1 defeat to Belgium. He scored two goals, against Costa Rica and Mexico, and provided one assist, while drawing 17 fouls, the highest in the tournament.

Neymar missed the 2019 Copa América due to an injury sustained in a friendly and subsequent off-field issues, though Brazil secured the title without him. In the 2021 Copa América, he played six matches as Brazil reached the final, losing 1–0 to Argentina; Neymar contributed two goals and two assists, earning joint Best Player honors alongside Lionel Messi.

At the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, an ankle injury limited Neymar to two appearances, including a goal in the 4–1 round-of-16 victory over South Korea; Brazil exited in the quarterfinals via penalties to Croatia after his absence in subsequent games. He did not participate in the 2024 Copa América, sidelined by an anterior cruciate ligament tear from October 2023, during which Brazil suffered a quarterfinal penalty shootout loss to Uruguay.

Since his last international appearance in September 2023, Neymar has not featured in Brazil's 2026 World Cup qualifiers amid ongoing recovery and fitness concerns, extending his absence to nearly two years by October 2025. His limited involvement post-2022 has raised questions about his role under coach Carlo Ancelotti, though he remains Brazil's all-time leading scorer.

During this period, Neymar achieved significant milestones, surpassing Pelé's record of 77 goals for Brazil with his 78th and 79th strikes in a 2–1 World Cup qualifier win over Bolivia on September 8, 2023, becoming the nation's top scorer with 79 goals in 128 caps. He holds the record for most assists in Brazilian national team history, though exact figures vary by source; his overall contributions include being the youngest to score four goals in a single match for Brazil, accomplished in 2014 but emblematic of his scoring prowess extending into this era. No major tournament titles were won by Brazil with Neymar's participation from 2018 onward, contrasting his earlier 2013 Confederations Cup success.

## Playing attributes

### Style of play

Neymar's playing style is characterized by exceptional dribbling, technical skill, and creativity, allowing him to navigate tight spaces with flair and precision. His close ball control and wide array of feints, including hesitation moves and rapid changes of direction, enable him to evade multiple defenders effectively, often turning defensive pressure into counterattacking opportunities. This trickery is purposeful rather than mere showmanship, as it frequently results in successful take-ons, with Neymar completing a high percentage of dribbles in high-stakes matches during his prime years at Barcelona and PSG. Experts note his efficient playmaking, where drawing defenders creates space for teammates, enhancing team dynamics through deliberate passing and vision.

In addition to dribbling prowess, Neymar demonstrates strong playmaking abilities, particularly when operating from the left flank with freedom to drift centrally, where his exceptional vision facilitates key passes and assists. His clinical finishing complements this, with a preference for curling shots and instinctive positioning inside the penalty area, contributing to over 400 career goals across club and international levels as of 2023. Influences from Brazilian icons like Ronaldinho are evident in his flamboyant yet effective style, which prioritizes instinctive decision-making over rigid tactical adherence. Over time, his role evolved from a rapid winger focused on speed and one-on-one duels to a more central creator, adapting to systems at PSG that emphasized combination play with forwards like Messi and Mbappé.

Despite these strengths, Neymar's style has limitations rooted in his physical attributes and discipline. At 175 cm tall, he struggles in aerial duels, winning fewer than 20% in league play according to performance metrics, which exposes vulnerabilities against robust defenses. His reliance on agility over physicality has been cited as a factor in injury susceptibility, with aggressive dribbling and frequent challenges potentially exacerbating muscle strains, as observed in multiple seasons marred by absences. Discipline issues, including a high rate of fouls drawn but also cards received, reflect a combative on-ball approach that sometimes borders on theatrical, drawing criticism for simulation despite genuine skill in provoking contact. These traits, while enabling his flair, underscore a style that thrives in possession-dominant teams but can falter in physical, transitional environments.

### Positions and tactical roles

Neymar primarily plays as a left winger or forward, often cutting inside onto his stronger right foot to create scoring opportunities or deliver crosses. His versatility allows deployment as an attacking midfielder, central forward, or second striker, adapting to various tactical setups across clubs and the Brazil national team. At Santos, he frequently operated as a second striker behind a target man, exploiting spaces created by the central forward through intelligent movement and off-ball runs.

In modern attacking systems, such as the 4-3-3 or 4-2-3-1 formations used by Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain, Neymar's tactical role emphasizes width on the left flank before drifting centrally to overload midfield areas, facilitate quick combinations, and challenge defenses in one-on-one situations. This inside-forward movement, akin to inverted wingers, enables him to contribute both goals and assists, with his dribbling prowess—averaging over 5 successful take-ons per game in peak seasons—disrupting compact defenses and drawing fouls to relieve pressure on teammates. For Brazil, he has assumed similar responsibilities, often as a wide forward in a fluid front three, where his playmaking from deeper positions supplements goal threats during transitions.

Neymar's positional fluidity stems from his technical proficiency and vision, allowing coaches to deploy him in hybrid roles that prioritize creativity over rigid positioning; however, his preference for left-sided starts has limited central experimentation in senior play, with statistics showing 70% of club appearances on the wings or in advanced midfield. At Al-Hilal, despite limited appearances due to injury, he reverted to a forward role focused on finishing and linking play in a possession-oriented setup. This adaptability underscores his value in high-pressing, attack-minded teams, though critics note occasional defensive lapses when positioned higher up the pitch.

## Reception and legacy

### Accolades and peak rankings

)Neymar has accumulated numerous team trophies across club and international levels, though his individual accolades remain notable for their absence of the Ballon d'Or or FIFA The Best awards despite high rankings. With Santos FC, he won the Copa Libertadores in 2011, scoring the winning penalty in the final against Peñarol on June 22, 2011. At Barcelona from 2013 to 2017, he contributed to two La Liga titles (2014–15, 2015–16), three Copa del Rey trophies (2014, 2015, 2016), one UEFA Champions League (2014–15, where he scored 10 goals including in the semifinal), one UEFA Super Cup (2015), and one FIFA Club World Cup (2015). With Paris Saint-Germain from 2017 to 2023, he secured five Ligue 1 titles (2017–18 to 2021–22), two Coupe de France (2019–20, 2020–21), four Coupe de la Ligue (2017–18, 2019–20), and three Trophée des Champions (2018, 2020, 2022). At Al-Hilal in 2023–24, he won the Saudi Pro League. Internationally for Brazil, highlights include the FIFA Confederations Cup in 2013 (scoring four goals, including the final winner against Spain on June 30, 2013) and Olympic gold in 2016 (scoring the decisive penalty in the final shootout against Germany on August 20, 2016). He also earned Olympic silver in 2012.

Individual honors include the FIFA Puskás Award in 2011 for his 56-yard goal against Flamengo on July 21, 2011, while at Santos. He was named South American Footballer of the Year in 2011 and 2012, and Brazilian Footballer of the Year in 2011. In 2013, he received the FIFA Confederations Cup Golden Ball as the tournament's best player. Neymar earned selections to the UEFA Champions League Squad of the Season in 2015 and was included in the FIFPRO World XI in 2015 and 2017. He has been top goalscorer in multiple competitions, including La Liga (2014–15 with 22 goals), Ligue 1 (2017–18, 2019–20), and the Saudi Pro League (2023–24).

Neymar's peak rankings in global player awards reflect strong contention but no outright victory. In the Ballon d'Or, his highest finishes were third place in 2015 (behind Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, following Barcelona's treble) and 2017 (after leading PSG to domestic dominance).

| Year | Ballon d'Or Ranking | Club |
|------|----------------------|------|
| 2011 | 10th                | Santos |
| 2012 | 13th                | Santos |
| 2013 | 5th                 | Santos/Barcelona |
| 2014 | 7th                 | Barcelona |
| 2015 | 3rd                 | Barcelona |
| 2016 | 5th                 | Barcelona |
| 2017 | 3rd                 | Barcelona/PSG |

These positions underscore his elite status during peak years at Barcelona, where team success amplified individual recognition, though overshadowed by Messi and Ronaldo's dominance.

### Comparative analysis and debates on greatness

Neymar's inclusion among football's all-time greats remains contentious, with proponents highlighting his technical brilliance and statistical output while detractors emphasize unfulfilled potential amid injuries, inconsistent performances in decisive matches, and lack of premier individual honors. Pelé, in 2016, named Neymar alongside Messi and Ronaldo as the only modern-era standouts capable of matching historical icons, praising his flair and goal-scoring prowess. However, empirical comparisons reveal stark disparities: Neymar has never won the Ballon d'Or, peaking at third place in 2015 and 2017, whereas Messi secured eight and Ronaldo five during overlapping careers.

In head-to-head metrics against Messi and Ronaldo, Neymar's career totals—443 goals and 257 assists in 732 club and international matches as of 2025—lag significantly behind their hauls exceeding 800 goals each, underscoring debates over work ethic and durability. Critics, including former Brazil manager Sebastião Lazaroni, argue Neymar's off-field distractions and injury proneness prevented him from emulating the sustained dominance of his rivals, labeling him "not an example for anyone" in 2025 amid his return to Santos. Supporters counter that his dribbling success rate (often over 60% in peak seasons at Barcelona and PSG) and role in Brazil's all-time scoring record (79 goals) affirm elite status, though his zero World Cup titles contrast sharply with Pelé's three or Ronaldo Nazário's two.

Legacy discussions often pivot to Brazilian predecessors: unlike Pelé's World Cup triumphs or Ronaldo's predatory finishing, Neymar's international record includes an Olympic gold in 2016 but semifinal exits in 2014 and 2022 World Cups marred by injuries and penalties conceded. South American expert Tim Vickery critiqued his 2023 Saudi move as "abandoning the battlefield" of European elites, potentially diminishing his claim to pantheon status. Yet, some analyses, like those in The Athletic, contend expectations inflated by early hype set an unattainable bar, positioning Neymar as a top-20 all-time talent whose flair influenced a generation, evidenced by his 2011 Puskás Award-winning goal and Champions League triumph with Barcelona in 2015.

| Metric | Neymar (as of 2025) | Lionel Messi | Cristiano Ronaldo |
|--------|---------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Ballon d'Or Wins | 0 | 8 | 5 |
| Career Goals | ~443 | \u003e800 | \u003e900 |
| Major International Trophies | 1 Olympic Gold | 1 World Cup, 3 Copa América | 1 Euro |
| Champions League Titles | 1 | 4 | 5 |

This table illustrates the quantitative gaps fueling arguments that Neymar, despite prodigious skill, prioritized spectacle over the ruthless efficiency defining undisputed greats.

## Criticisms and controversies

### On-field behavior and sportsmanship

Neymar has been repeatedly criticized for simulating fouls and exaggerating contact during matches, behaviors that opponents and analysts attribute to gamesmanship rather than genuine injury. In the 2018 FIFA World Cup round of 16 match against Mexico on July 2, a minor challenge from Hirving Lozano prompted Neymar to collapse and remain on the ground for over two minutes, drawing accusations of feigned agony from commentators and fans alike. This incident exemplified a pattern observed throughout the tournament, where Neymar's reactions to challenges fueled debates on soccer's tolerance for such theatrics, with BBC Sport noting his dives, flicks, and emotional displays as sparking global discussion on sportsmanship. Referees have sanctioned him for simulation, including a second yellow card—leading to a red card—for diving in Paris Saint-Germain's Ligue 1 win over Strasbourg on December 28, 2022, marking his fifth red card with the club and underscoring officials' view of deliberate deception.

Such conduct has extended to dissent and provocative gestures, contributing to a reputation for poor temperament under pressure. For instance, Neymar has received yellow cards for excessive showboating and arguing with referees, as seen in a 2020 Ligue 1 match against Montpellier where he was cautioned for dribbling in a manner deemed overly celebratory. Critics, including Forbes contributors, argue these antics embody soccer's least appealing elements, eroding the sport's integrity by prioritizing deception over resilience, particularly given Neymar's high foul-suffering rate—leading Ligue 1 with 133 fouls drawn in the 2017–18 season—which some claim invites but does not justify exaggeration. In response, Neymar has acknowledged the scrutiny, admitting post-2018 World Cup that he questioned his own tendencies but maintained that blame was overstated, while Brazil's football confederation defended him in 2013 against similar accusations during the Confederations Cup, asserting he was not a habitual diver.

Proponents of Neymar contend that his flair-heavy style—characterized by close control and feints—naturally provokes aggressive tackles, with data from the 2018 World Cup showing him targeted more than most players, potentially explaining heightened reactions as self-preservation amid physical tolls. However, empirical evidence from video reviews and bookings indicates simulation occurs, as in documented cases where minimal or no contact preceded prolonged rolls, diminishing credibility when legitimate fouls arise. Overall, while Neymar's behavior has elicited defenses rooted in tactical necessity, the preponderance of referee interventions and peer critiques points to a causal link between his antics and perceptions of diminished sportsmanship, impacting his legacy beyond technical prowess.

### Injury history and self-management

Neymar's career has been marked by recurrent injuries, particularly to his ankles, feet, and lower body, resulting in substantial absences. Data from injury tracking services indicate he has missed approximately 1,445 days—equivalent to over four years—due to various ailments, with major setbacks including multiple metatarsal fractures, ankle ligament tears, and a cruciate ligament rupture.

Early notable injuries include a fractured vertebra sustained during Brazil's 2014 FIFA World Cup quarter-final against Colombia on July 4, 2014, which forced his withdrawal from the tournament and required six weeks of recovery involving specialized physiotherapy to prevent long-term spinal issues. At Paris Saint-Germain, he endured a metatarsal fracture on February 25, 2018, sidelining him for 91 days and causing him to miss 16 matches, followed by a relapse in January 2019 leading to an 86-day absence. More recently, an ankle injury in February 2023 necessitated surgery, resulting in 131 days out, and a cruciate ligament tear on October 17, 2023, during a Brazil match kept him absent for 340 days, during which he also dealt with subsequent muscular problems adding 31 more days. These patterns have limited his availability, with Neymar missing over 100 club games and key international fixtures since joining PSG in 2017.

Medical analyses attribute much of the recurrence to an initial stress fracture in his fifth metatarsal, which compromised biomechanics and led to cascading soft-tissue and joint issues, exacerbated by his high-risk playing style involving rapid directional changes, dribbling under pressure, and frequent contact. PSG and Brazil national team physicians have cited multifaceted causes, including physical overload from an intense schedule, incomplete prior recoveries, and Neymar's dynamic movement patterns that increase vulnerability to trauma, rather than inherent fragility alone.

In self-management, Neymar has relied on advanced medical interventions, such as surgical repairs and targeted rehabilitation, often pushing recovery limits through daily intensive sessions focused on strength rebuilding and mental resilience. Following his 2023 ACL tear, he publicly shared struggles, stating in August 2024 that "there are days I want to give up," highlighting the psychological toll while committing to prolonged protocols exceeding standard timelines to mitigate re-injury risks. However, prior relapses, like the 2019 pseudoarthrosis from rushed 2018 foot healing, underscore challenges in balancing aggressive return-to-play timelines with conservative tissue restoration, as noted in physiotherapy case studies. Despite these efforts, critics within football circles, including some medical reports, question whether lifestyle factors or inconsistent load management contribute to vulnerability, though empirical evidence ties primary causality to on-field demands and prior biomechanical deficits.

### Off-field lifestyle and legal issues

Neymar has frequently been criticized for maintaining a lavish off-field lifestyle characterized by frequent partying, which some observers, including Brazilian journalists and former teammates, attribute to contributing to his injury proneness and inconsistent professionalism. In a 2016 interview, Neymar defended his habits, stating he parties only during off-days or vacations and questioning why he should not enjoy such activities as an adult. Similar defenses came in 2021, where he asserted that his sustained elite-level performance disproves claims of irresponsibility, emphasizing seriousness in training. Critics, however, point to documented instances of nightclub appearances and social media posts during recovery periods, such as after injuries at Paris Saint-Germain, as evidence of poor self-discipline. In September 2025, Brazilian journalist Rodolfo Gomes accused Neymar of abusing alcohol, energy drinks, smoking hookah, and late-night gaming while at Santos, prompting Neymar to file a lawsuit against him for defamation and fake information.

Legally, Neymar was embroiled in disputes stemming from his 2013 transfer from Santos to Barcelona, where Spanish prosecutors initially pursued fraud and corruption charges over alleged irregularities in the €57.1 million deal, including hidden payments to his family via shell companies like N\u0026N Consultoria. The case, which led to a 2022 trial, saw all charges against Neymar dropped by prosecutors in October 2022 due to insufficient evidence of criminal intent, followed by his acquittal in December 2022. A separate contract dispute with Barcelona over a €43 million renewal bonus unpaid after his 2017 departure was resolved amicably out of court in July 2021, with terms undisclosed. In 2019, a Brazilian woman accused Neymar of rape following a hotel encounter arranged via Instagram, but São Paulo authorities closed the investigation in July 2019 citing lack of evidence and inconsistencies in her account, subsequently charging her with fraud, extortion, and slander.

Additional controversies include a 2021 fallout with Nike, his long-time sponsor, after allegations surfaced of him sexually assaulting a female employee at a 2016 event in the United States; Nike terminated the partnership citing his refusal to cooperate with their internal probe, though no criminal charges were filed and Neymar denied the claims, countersuing for breach of contract. These incidents have fueled debates on his maturity, but resolutions in his favor across major cases underscore a pattern where initial accusations often lacked substantiation upon scrutiny.

### Transfer motivations and career choices

Neymar's departure from Santos to Barcelona in May 2013, facilitated through a complex transfer structure involving the investment fund DIS, sparked controversies over opaque payments and allegations of tax evasion, with a Brazilian court later ruling against him for irregularities in the deal valued at around €57 million. Critics highlighted how the arrangement prioritized personal financial arrangements over transparent club loyalty, setting a pattern of contentious moves early in his career.

His 2017 transfer to Paris Saint-Germain for a then-world-record €222 million activation of his release clause was lambasted as a mercenary decision, abandoning a successful Barcelona tenure alongside Lionel Messi and Luis Suárez—where he contributed to two La Liga titles and a Champions League— in pursuit of individual prominence and Qatari-backed wealth, despite Neymar's public denial of monetary motivations. The move inflated player valuations across football but yielded no Champions League success for PSG despite assembling a star-laden squad, fueling accusations that Neymar valued short-term gains over competitive legacy.

The 2023 shift to Al-Hilal for €90 million, entailing an annual salary exceeding €100 million, exemplified further career choices criticized as prioritizing exorbitant pay in a nascent league over European elite contention, especially amid no viable offers from top clubs after PSG frustrations. Limited to seven appearances due to recurrent injuries, the transfer has been deemed financially ruinous for the club—costing approximately $35 million per minute played—and emblematic of Neymar's pattern of chasing fiscal security at the expense of sustained peak performance and club commitment.

Throughout, Neymar's serial relocations—spanning three continents in a decade—have drawn rebukes for lacking fidelity to any single project, with observers attributing his unfulfilled Ballon d'Or aspirations to decisions favoring personal enrichment and spotlight over disciplined progression in top-tier environments.

## Personal life

### Family background and relationships

Neymar da Silva Santos Júnior was born on February 5, 1992, in Mogi das Cruzes, São Paulo state, Brazil, to parents Neymar Santos Sr. and Nadine da Silva (later known as Nadine Gonçalves). His father, a former semi-professional footballer who played as a striker in Brazil's lower divisions during the 1980s and 1990s, transitioned into business and became his son's primary advisor and business manager, overseeing major transfers and financial decisions. The family initially lived in modest conditions in a favela, facing financial hardships that shaped an early emphasis on discipline and opportunity through sports, before relocating to the beachfront neighborhood of Praia Grande for better training access. Neymar's mother, who managed the household and instilled a strong Pentecostal Christian faith in the family, separated from Neymar Sr. in 2016 after 25 years of marriage. He has one sibling, a younger sister named Rafaella Santos, who has pursued modeling and social media influencing.

Neymar has two children from separate relationships. His first child, son Davi Lucca da Silva Santos, was born on August 24, 2011, to former girlfriend Carolina Dantas, with whom he maintains a cordial co-parenting arrangement despite their brief romantic involvement ending shortly after. His second child, daughter Mavie Ellen Christyne da Silva Santos, was born on October 5, 2023, to influencer Bruna Biancardi, following a relationship that began around 2021 but ended amid reported infidelity allegations in late 2023. Neymar's most publicized romantic partnership was an on-again, off-again relationship with Brazilian actress Bruna Marquezine from 2013 to 2018, marked by public appearances and media scrutiny, though it concluded without marriage or children. He has been linked to other figures in modeling and entertainment, but none have resulted in long-term commitments or additional offspring as of 2025.

### Health and non-football medical issues

In August 2015, while playing for FC Barcelona, Neymar was diagnosed with parotitis, commonly known as mumps, a contagious viral infection causing inflammation of the salivary glands. Despite having been vaccinated against the disease, he exhibited symptoms including facial swelling, which he documented publicly, and was sidelined for approximately two weeks, missing matches such as the UEFA Super Cup and the Spanish Supercopa de España.  The diagnosis was confirmed by Barcelona's medical staff, attributing the condition to non-sporting transmission rather than any on-field activity.

On June 7, 2025, Neymar tested positive for COVID-19 shortly after returning to his former club Santos, having developed symptoms that prompted isolation from training since June 5. Santos issued an official statement confirming the diagnosis via PCR testing, noting he was receiving symptomatic treatment at home under medical supervision, with no immediate football-related implications cited. This episode delayed his integration into the squad but resolved without reported long-term complications, consistent with the typically acute nature of SARS-CoV-2 infections in otherwise healthy adults.

No other verified non-football medical conditions, such as chronic illnesses or unrelated surgical interventions, have been publicly documented in Neymar's health history, with available records emphasizing these isolated viral episodes over any systemic issues.

## Business and public image

### Endorsements and financial empire

Neymar has secured numerous endorsement deals throughout his career, establishing him as one of the most marketable athletes globally with an estimated 35 sponsorship agreements as of 2024. His primary apparel sponsor transitioned from Nike to Puma in a long-term partnership announced in 2023, which extends to his management company NR Sports and emphasizes creative expression in sportswear. Additional major deals include Red Bull for energy drinks, Gillette for grooming products, and Beats by Dre for audio equipment, contributing to annual endorsement earnings of approximately $30 million as reported by Forbes in 2024. Other partnerships encompass Diesel for fragrances, Superdry for sustainable fashion since 2020, and brands like Panasonic, McDonald's, and OPPO for electronics and consumer goods.

Beyond traditional endorsements, Neymar has ventured into gaming and betting sectors, serving as a brand ambassador for PokerStars since 2015, participating in high-stakes tournaments such as the World Series of Poker and online events where he earned $99,000 as runner-up in a 2025 PokerStars championship. Recent sponsorships include Blaze and Flutter Entertainment for online gaming, alongside Konami for video games and MercadoLibre for e-commerce in Latin America.

Neymar's financial empire is anchored by NR Sports, his family-run agency that manages his career and commercial interests, including esports investments and brand collaborations. His net worth is estimated at around $250-350 million as of 2025, derived primarily from soccer salaries exceeding $46 million annually, endorsement income, and diversified assets like real estate and luxury purchases, though persistent injuries have impacted earning potential. These ventures reflect a strategy of leveraging personal branding for off-field revenue, with poker and gaming deals adding millions through appearances and winnings despite occasional high-profile losses, such as $1 million in a single online casino session streamed on Twitch.

### Media presence and entertainment ventures

Neymar possesses one of the largest social media followings among athletes, with approximately 231 million Instagram followers as of October 2025, ranking him among the top global influencers in sports.  His posts often blend football highlights, luxury lifestyle glimpses, family moments, and brand promotions, generating high engagement rates that underscore his marketability beyond the pitch. This digital footprint has amplified his global brand, with his account driving significant interactions, such as boosting Al-Hilal's Instagram engagements by millions upon his 2023 signing.

In entertainment, Neymar featured as the central subject of the 2022 Netflix docuseries *Neymar: The Perfect Chaos*, a three-episode production that chronicles elements of his career trajectory, personal challenges, and public persona. The series, directed by Daniel Adjustingues, includes interviews and archival footage, portraying him as both a celebrated talent and a figure prone to controversy, though some reviews critiqued its narrative as superficial despite entertaining segments.  No major acting roles or music releases by Neymar have been documented in verified projects, with his media involvement primarily tied to promotional and documentary formats rather than scripted or performative ventures.
