## Introduction

Brian Chesky is an American entrepreneur and industrial designer, best known as the co-founder and CEO of Airbnb, a global online marketplace for lodging and tourism experiences. Born on August 29, 1981, in Niskayuna, New York, Chesky has played a pivotal role in revolutionizing the travel and hospitality industry through the concept of peer-to-peer home-sharing. Under his leadership, Airbnb has grown from a small startup in 2008 to a publicly traded company valued at billions of dollars, reshaping how people travel and connect worldwide. Chesky is often recognized as a leading figure in the sharing economy and a prominent advocate for innovative business models [Forbes Profile](https://www.forbes.com/profile/brian-chesky/).

## Early Life and Education

Brian Joseph Chesky was raised in Niskayuna, a suburb of Schenectady, New York. From a young age, he displayed an interest in design and creativity, which later influenced his career path. He attended the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD), where he earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Industrial Design in 2004. During his time at RISD, Chesky met Joe Gebbia, who would later become his co-founder at Airbnb. His design background provided him with a unique perspective on user experience, which became a cornerstone of Airbnb’s platform development [Bloomberg Bio](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/profiles/brian-j-chesky/).

After graduating, Chesky worked as an industrial designer and strategist in Los Angeles, focusing on product design. However, feeling unfulfilled in his role, he sought a more entrepreneurial path, eventually moving to San Francisco to pursue new opportunities. This decision marked the beginning of his journey with Airbnb [CNBC Interview](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/02/10/how-airbnb-ceo-brian-chesky-went-from-broke-to-billionaire.html).

## Founding of Airbnb

In 2007, Chesky moved to San Francisco to join forces with Joe Gebbia. Facing financial struggles and unable to afford rent, the duo came up with the idea of renting out air mattresses in their apartment to attendees of a sold-out design conference. They created a simple website called "Airbed & Breakfast" to advertise their space, marking the inception of what would become Airbnb. Along with their third co-founder, Nathan Blecharczyk, they officially launched the company in August 2008 [Airbnb History](https://news.airbnb.com/about-us/).

The concept evolved from renting air mattresses to a broader platform allowing individuals to list and book unique accommodations worldwide. Chesky and his team faced numerous challenges in the early years, including skepticism from investors and legal hurdles related to short-term rentals. However, their persistence paid off when they secured funding from Y Combinator in 2009, a startup accelerator that provided crucial support and mentorship [TechCrunch Y Combinator](https://techcrunch.com/2009/04/07/y-combinator-startup-airbed-breakfast-changes-name-to-airbnb/).

Under Chesky’s leadership as CEO, Airbnb expanded rapidly, focusing on user-friendly design, community trust, and global scalability. By 2020, Airbnb went public through an initial public offering (IPO), achieving a valuation of over $100 billion on its first day of trading, solidifying Chesky’s status as a billionaire entrepreneur [Reuters IPO](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-airbnb-ipo/airbnb-ipo-values-company-at-100-billion-in-blockbuster-debut-idUSKBN28K1HL).
