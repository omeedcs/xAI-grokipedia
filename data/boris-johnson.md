# Boris Johnson

Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson (born 19 June 1964) is a British politician who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 2019 to 2022 and Leader of the Conservative Party from 2019 to 2022. He previously held office as Mayor of London from 2008 to 2016 and as Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs from 2016 to 2018. Johnson emerged as a prominent figure in the 2016 referendum on UK membership of the European Union, co-leading the Vote Leave campaign that secured a 52% to 48% victory for departure. As prime minister, his administration finalised the UK's exit from the EU on 31 January 2020, achieved a landslide general election win in December 2019 with an 80-seat majority, and directed the rapid procurement and rollout of COVID-19 vaccines, enabling earlier easing of restrictions compared to some European peers. His tenure also encompassed controversies, including allegations of lockdown rule breaches during the pandemic—known as Partygate—that prompted parliamentary investigations and contributed to his resignation in July 2022 following ministerial resignations and a narrow survival of a confidence vote. Johnson's leadership style, characterised by rhetorical flair and a focus on sovereignty and infrastructure projects like the Northern Powerhouse Rail, polarised observers, with supporters crediting him for delivering Brexit and economic optimism pre-COVID, while critics highlighted governance lapses and policy inconsistencies.

## Early life and education

### Family background and childhood

Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson was born on 19 June 1964 in New York City to British parents Stanley Johnson, an economist and environmentalist who worked for the World Bank and later the European Commission, and Charlotte Johnson Wahl, a professional painter. His birth in the United States granted him dual British-American citizenship, which he held until renouncing U.S. citizenship in 2016 to avoid tax obligations on global assets.

Johnson's ancestry includes Turkish Muslim roots through his paternal great-grandfather Ali Kemal, a journalist and politician who criticized the Ottoman policies during World War I and later opposed Mustafa Kemal Atatürk's nationalists, leading to his lynching by a mob in 1922. Stanley Johnson's career necessitated frequent relocations, with the family moving over 30 times in Johnson's first 14 years across the United States (including Norwalk, Connecticut), the United Kingdom (such as Maida Vale in London and Winsford in Somerset), and continental Europe (including Belgium). These shifts exposed him to diverse settings, from urban London to rural Exmoor farms, fostering adaptability amid instability.

As the eldest of four children—followed by sister Rachel (born 1965), brother Jo (born 1971), and brother Leo (born 1974)—Johnson grew up in a competitive household marked by intellectual rivalry among siblings. His parents' marriage deteriorated amid Stanley's absences and Charlotte's struggles with obsessive-compulsive disorder, culminating in separation around 1978 and divorce in 1979. Charlotte later described the family's peripatetic life as chaotic yet formative, with Johnson often assuming a rambunctious, leadership role among his siblings during the disruptions.

### Eton College

Johnson entered Eton College, a prestigious boarding school in Berkshire, in 1977 at age 13 and remained until 1982. He secured one of the 70 competitive King's Scholarships, which provided partial fee remission and recognized academic promise, enabling attendance despite his family's variable financial circumstances. His curriculum emphasized classics, including Latin and Ancient Greek, aligning with Eton's traditional focus on humanistic studies that honed analytical and linguistic skills.

Extracurricularly, Johnson excelled in debating, leading the school's Debating Society and cultivating a command of rhetoric through competitive public speaking. He also participated in rugby, contributing to team efforts on the field, which complemented the school's emphasis on physical vigor and collective discipline. Johnson was elected to the Eton Society, known as Pop, a student-elected body of prefects responsible for upholding school traditions and overseeing certain privileges.

Academically, Johnson's record was uneven; while capable in classics due to a strong memory for texts, his housemaster criticized a "disgracefully cavalier attitude" toward studies, noting laziness in preparation despite intellectual potential. This contrasted with his prowess in oral performance, where effortless superiority in debate masked inconsistent scholarly effort.

Eton's hierarchical, tradition-bound environment, with its rituals and elite peer group, shaped Johnson's outgoing, performative persona, fostering a bombastic communication style rooted in classical oratory and a lifelong network among future political and social influencers.

### Oxford University

Johnson arrived at Balliol College, University of Oxford, in 1983 on a scholarship to study *Literae Humaniores*, the four-year undergraduate course in Classics covering ancient literature, history, and philosophy. He completed the degree in 1987, receiving a Bachelor of Arts with upper second-class honours (2:1). His academic pursuits immersed him in the rigorous analysis of classical texts, fostering skills in rhetoric and argumentation that later characterized his public style.

At the Oxford Union, Johnson engaged deeply in debating and politics, initially losing a bid for presidency to Neil Sherlock in an election framed as a clash between public school privilege and meritocratic ascent. He successfully ran again and served as president in 1986, amid allegations of ballot irregularities raised by opponents, which a Union tribunal ultimately dismissed, clearing him of wrongdoing. This role exposed him to conservative intellectual circles and honed his oratorical flair, while the Union's competitive environment reinforced his affinity for high-stakes rhetorical combat.

Johnson joined the Bullingdon Club, an exclusive all-male dining society notorious for its affluent membership, formal attire, and sporadic destructive antics, which included figures like David Cameron. This milieu reflected Oxford's elite social networks, blending privilege with a culture of boisterous camaraderie. Concurrently, he contributed articles to *The Isis*, Oxford's historic student magazine, revealing early journalistic inclinations through satirical and observational pieces on university life. These activities underscored his burgeoning interest in writing and public discourse within Oxford's conservative-leaning debating ecosystem.

## Journalistic career

### Reporting for The Times and The Daily Telegraph

Johnson joined *The Times* as a graduate trainee reporter in 1987. His tenure ended abruptly in 1988 when he was dismissed for fabricating a quotation attributed to his godfather, the historian Colin Lucas, in an article about archaeological excavations at King Edward II's palace in London; Johnson later described the incident as causing him to "hang my head in shame."

Following his departure from *The Times*, Johnson moved to *The Daily Telegraph* in 1988, initially working as a general reporter before being assigned as its Brussels correspondent from 1989 to 1994. In this role, he filed dispatches critiquing European Union institutions, emphasizing what he portrayed as bureaucratic overreach and regulatory absurdities, such as directives on the curvature of bananas and cucumbers, which contributed to the rise of Eurosceptic sentiment in British media. These reports, often laced with hyperbole and satire, boosted *The Telegraph*'s readership among conservative audiences but drew accusations from EU officials and some journalists of exaggeration or invention to amplify anti-integration narratives.

Johnson's prose in these pieces established his journalistic persona through vivid, irreverent language, incorporating classical allusions, unexpected metaphors, and a tone of defiant humor that positioned him as an anti-establishment voice challenging continental elites. This style, while entertaining and commercially successful, reflected a deliberate emphasis on polemical flair over strict factual restraint, as evidenced by later admissions and critiques from contemporaries who noted his tendency to prioritize narrative impact.

### Political columnism

In 1994, Johnson transitioned from foreign reporting to opinion writing, becoming the *Daily Telegraph*'s chief political columnist after his recall from Brussels. His pieces frequently adopted a contrarian tone, challenging the European Union's regulatory overreach, which he portrayed as a threat to British sovereignty and free markets, while expressing skepticism toward supranational governance structures. Johnson also critiqued elements of political correctness and multiculturalism, as well as New Labour's social policies under Tony Blair, framing them as impediments to traditional British values and individual liberty.

Johnson simultaneously contributed freelance opinion pieces to *The Spectator*, where his writing blended classical allusions, humor, and populist appeals to cultivate a distinctive voice as a libertarian-leaning conservative. These columns advocated for deregulation, lower taxes, and market-driven solutions, positioning him as an outsider to establishment consensus on issues like EU integration. His provocative style—marked by witty invective and erudite references—drew readership and enhanced his public profile, though it occasionally prompted corrections for factual inaccuracies or exaggerations in earlier reporting that carried over into opinion work.

Through these platforms from 1994 to 1999, Johnson's columnism amplified Eurosceptic sentiments in conservative circles, influencing discourse by prioritizing national self-determination over federalist ideals and boosting publication visibility via his growing personal charisma, even amid criticisms of selective facts to underscore arguments. This period solidified his brand as a flamboyant defender of free-market principles against perceived bureaucratic excesses.

### Editorship of The Spectator

Johnson was appointed editor of *The Spectator* in 1999 by owner Conrad Black, succeeding Dominic Lawson. Under his tenure, the magazine adopted an irreverent tone blending highbrow political essays with scandalous social gossip, which contributed to a circulation rise from around 57,500 to nearly 70,000 copies weekly, alongside achieving profitability for the first time in years. This growth reflected Johnson's emphasis on engaging, contrarian content that appealed to conservative readers skeptical of the Blair government's policies, including critiques of its economic interventions and cultural shifts away from traditional values.

The publication under Johnson frequently challenged New Labour's dominance, advocating Thatcherite principles such as free-market reforms and limited state involvement while highlighting perceived hypocrisies in Blair's administration, such as its handling of public services and foreign policy. Johnson balanced this with defenses of free speech, overseeing pieces that provoked debate; for instance, in 2004, *The Spectator* published an article blaming Liverpool fans for aspects of the 1989 Hillsborough disaster, drawing widespread condemnation from city officials and victims' families who demanded an apology, which Johnson initially resisted before issuing one under pressure. Such editorial choices underscored the magazine's right-leaning ideological stance but also fueled accusations of insensitivity, with critics arguing they prioritized provocation over factual rigor.

Johnson's dual role as editor and Conservative MP for Henley from 2001 onward strained resources, yet he retained the position until December 2005, when new chief executive Andrew Neil dismissed him amid a scandal involving cocaine use allegations at *The Spectator*'s offices—claims Johnson denied involvement in, attributing them to a junior staffer. His departure followed acceptance of a shadow cabinet role as higher education spokesman under David Cameron, marking the end of an era that revitalized the magazine commercially and reinforced its influence within Tory circles, though not without polarizing its public image.

## Parliamentary and early political roles

### Member of Parliament for Henley (2001–2008)

Johnson was selected as the Conservative candidate for the safe seat of Henley-on-Thames in July 2000, succeeding the retiring Michael Heseltine, a prominent pro-European figure within the party. He secured election on 7 June 2001 with 13,944 votes, achieving a majority of 8,455 over the Liberal Democrat runner-up. The constituency, a rural area in Oxfordshire, had been a Conservative stronghold, and Johnson's victory margin reflected its reliability despite national Labour gains.

In Parliament, Johnson prioritized constituency matters, particularly rural agriculture amid the ongoing foot-and-mouth disease crisis, where he criticized falling farm incomes—down to less than a third of 1997 levels under Labour—and inadequate government support in a July 2001 debate. He also addressed transport challenges for rural communities, contributing to discussions on connectivity in a June 2001 debate regretting the absence of agricultural and countryside policies in the Queen's Speech. Johnson's Eurosceptic outlook, contrasting Heseltine's integrationist views, informed his advocacy for British sovereignty over European federalism.

Appointed Shadow Minister for the Arts and party vice-chairman by Michael Howard in September 2004, Johnson's frontbench tenure ended abruptly in November after he admitted misleading Howard regarding an extramarital affair with journalist Petronella Wyatt, which involved claims of pregnancies and abortions; he offered resignation but was sacked. He nevertheless won reelection on 5 May 2005 with 24,894 votes and a majority of 12,793, up from 2001. In December 2005, Howard reappointed him as Shadow Higher Education Minister, a post Johnson retained until July 2007 while simultaneously editing *The Spectator* until resigning that month to focus on the role. His affable, larger-than-life demeanor fostered backbench rapport, aiding Conservative efforts to refresh its public image post-defeats.

### Shadow Cabinet positions

In May 2004, Conservative leader Michael Howard appointed Johnson as Shadow Minister for Culture, Arts and Media, a role in which he outlined a six-point plan to revitalize Britain's arts sector, including calls for reduced bureaucracy in funding and greater emphasis on classical heritage amid concerns over declining public support. His tenure lasted only until November 2004, when Howard dismissed him after Johnson initially denied and then misled the leadership regarding an extramarital affair with journalist Petronella Wyatt, prompting accusations of dishonesty that undermined party discipline ahead of the general election.

Following David Cameron's election as Conservative leader in December 2005, Johnson was reinstated to the frontbench as Shadow Minister for Higher Education, where he served until July 2007. In this position, Johnson advocated for enhanced university autonomy from state interference, critiquing Labour's centralizing tendencies and proposing policies to foster innovation and intellectual freedom, as detailed in his 2006 Politeia pamphlet *Aspire Ever Higher*, which warned of universities' financial threats under existing funding models. He blended erudite allusions to classical education with populist critiques of bureaucratic overreach, contributing to the party's evolving platform on cultural and educational policy that emphasized heritage preservation alongside accessible higher learning.

Johnson's Commons performances during this period were marked by unscripted, engaging rhetoric—often drawing on historical and literary references—that captivated audiences but occasionally veered into gaffes, reinforcing his image as a charismatic outsider within the more polished Cameron operation. This style bolstered his grassroots appeal among Tory members, positioning him as a perceived leadership rival to Cameron despite skepticism from party elites wary of his unpredictability and media distractions. He resigned the post on 4 July 2007 to pursue the London mayoral candidacy, prioritizing broader public visibility over continued opposition duties.

## Mayoralty of London (2008–2016)

### 2008 election victory

Boris Johnson announced his candidacy for the Conservative nomination in the 2008 London mayoral election on 16 July 2007, promising a "frank and candid" approach amid a chaotic launch outside City Hall. He secured the party's endorsement in late September 2007 after defeating rivals in an open primary, positioning himself as the frontrunner against incumbent Labour mayor Ken Livingstone. Johnson's campaign emphasized reducing crime, particularly knife and gun offenses on public transport, alongside pledges for transport enhancements and rooting out perceived cronyism at City Hall under Livingstone, who faced scandals over undeclared gifts and donations. These themes tapped into voter dissatisfaction with rising youth violence and Livingstone's governance style, though Johnson's appeal relied heavily on his charismatic, humorous persona rather than detailed policy contrasts.

The election on 1 May 2008 used a supplementary vote system, with Johnson receiving 43% of first-preference votes compared to Livingstone's 37%, advancing both to the runoff after eliminating Liberal Democrat candidate Brian Paddick. In the second round, Johnson won with 53.2% of votes (1,168,738) to Livingstone's 46.8% (1,028,966), marking an upset in a city with a Labour-leaning electorate. Turnout rose to approximately 45%, reflecting heightened interest driven by the high-profile contest and Johnson's novelty as a candidate. Support was strongest in outer London boroughs, where suburban voters shifted toward Conservatives amid frustration with inner-city focused policies and national Labour unpopularity under Prime Minister Gordon Brown.

Johnson's victory made him the first Conservative mayor since the office's creation in 2000, ending Livingstone's eight-year tenure and signaling a rejection of the incumbent's progressive but divisive record. He highlighted potential benefits from the 2012 Olympic Games, already secured for London in 2005, as a platform for infrastructure legacy and economic boost, aligning with his optimistic vision for the city. The result underscored Johnson's personal popularity transcending traditional party lines in a diverse metropolis, though critics noted limited scrutiny of his substantive plans amid the campaign's focus on personality.

### First term: Policies and initiatives

Upon assuming office in May 2008, Johnson prioritized transport improvements, launching the Cycle Hire scheme—colloquially known as Boris Bikes—on 30 July 2010 with 5,000 bicycles across 315 docking stations in central London. The initiative aimed to promote sustainable short-distance travel, covering over 10 million kilometers by early 2011 and expanding eastward by spring 2012 in anticipation of the Olympics. Concurrently, Johnson revived the iconic Routemaster bus design, commissioning the New Routemaster in 2008; prototypes were unveiled in November 2011, with the first vehicles entering service on route 38 in February 2012, featuring open rear platforms for hop-on-hop-off access despite accessibility debates. 

Johnson focused on policing by maintaining Metropolitan Police officer numbers at around 32,000 and emphasizing visible patrols, contributing to an overall reported crime reduction of 10-11% in London by 2012 compared to 2008 levels. Knife crime offences showed mixed trends, with some increases in recorded incidents but declines in fatalities, which Johnson attributed to heightened stop-and-search practices and additional community support officers.  These efforts aligned with national downward trends in violent crime post-2008 financial crisis, though critics questioned the causal impact amid broader economic recovery.

Preparations for the 2012 Summer Olympics dominated Johnson's first term, with the mayor overseeing infrastructure legacy projects and public engagement to ensure smooth delivery despite inherited timelines from the 2005 bid win. His high-profile advocacy, including defending London's readiness against international skepticism, helped elevate the event's global perception, fostering economic boosts through tourism and investment. On housing, Johnson set targets for 50,000 affordable units annually via the London Plan but faced criticism for delivery shortfalls, with only modest gains amid rising demand and prices exacerbating shortages.

Environmentally, Johnson pledged air quality improvements, securing £5 million for a Clean Air Fund and modifying the Low Emission Zone, though he scrapped the western congestion charge expansion and delayed stricter enforcement, drawing European Commission rebukes for insufficient pollution reductions.  London's economy demonstrated resilience, with GDP growth resuming post-2008 recession under Johnson's growth manifestos emphasizing job creation and infrastructure.

### Re-election and second term

Johnson secured re-election as Mayor of London on 3 May 2012, defeating Labour challenger Ken Livingstone in a preferential voting system, with Johnson receiving 1,054,811 votes (51.5%) in the final round compared to Livingstone's 48.5%. His first-preference vote share stood at 44.0%, against Livingstone's 40.3%, on a turnout of approximately 38.1%. The campaign leveraged the anticipated momentum from the upcoming 2012 Summer Olympics, which Johnson had championed as a symbol of London's global appeal and economic vitality amid post-financial crisis recovery.

In his second term, Johnson prioritized continuity in policing reforms following the August 2011 riots, advocating for sustained community-oriented strategies and rejecting proposed national police budget cuts to maintain officer presence on streets. He expanded commitments to affordable housing amid surging property prices, pledging record deliveries of new units, though by 2014 projections indicated shortfalls against the 55,000-home target set for 2015.

Johnson supported the Metropolitan Police's 2014 proposal to acquire three second-hand water cannons from Germany at a cost of around £90,000 to enhance riot control capabilities, even volunteering to test one personally; the initiative was ultimately rejected by Home Secretary Theresa May in July 2015 over safety and proportionality concerns. During his tenure, youth-related offences declined notably: police-recorded homicides dropped from 21 to 13 per million residents, overall crime fell 23%, and knife crime offences decreased by 31% over eight years.

Johnson's term concluded in May 2016 with approval ratings exceeding 50%, attributed by supporters to infrastructure advancements including Olympic legacies and transport expansions that bolstered London's resilience.

### Institutional relations and public events

During his mayoralty, Johnson experienced tensions with the Metropolitan Police leadership following the 2011 London riots, which began after the fatal shooting of Mark Duggan on August 4, 2011, and resulted in widespread disorder, five deaths, and over 3,000 arrests. In response, Johnson, who was heckled by crowds during a visit to the affected Clapham area on August 9, 2011, advocated for enhanced stop-and-search powers to restore public safety, clashing with police commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe over proposed reductions in the practice, which Johnson argued contributed to rising knife crime in subsequent years. He supported the creation of the Metropolitan Police's Gangs Matrix database in the riots' aftermath to track gang members, a tool that logged over 3,000 individuals by 2016 but drew later criticism for potential biases in data collection.

Johnson maintained high media visibility as mayor, often through gaffes that amplified his public persona, such as his 2012 zipwire mishap during Olympic promotions where he dangled mid-air holding Union Jack flags, an incident widely covered but which bolstered his relatable image rather than damaging it. His proposal for a Thames Estuary airport, dubbed "Boris Island," generated significant press in 2012–2014, including a briefing controversy that drew Downing Street rebuke, yet highlighted his infrastructure ambitions amid debates over Heathrow expansion. Post-2008 financial crash, Johnson cultivated ties with London's finance sector, defending bankers against populist attacks and promoting the City as a global hub, crediting it for employing over 500,000 people and contributing £65 billion in tax revenue annually by 2012.

A highlight of Johnson's tenure was London's hosting of the 2012 Summer Olympics, for which he served as a prominent advocate and organizer, securing cross-party support and overseeing an event that sold 10.8 million tickets, generated £10 billion in economic impact, and earned international acclaim for its execution despite pre-Games transport concerns. The Games' success, including the Paralympics' sell-out attendance, enhanced London's global image, with Johnson personally engaging in publicity stunts that underscored his hands-on approach to public events.

Critics accused Johnson of cronyism in appointments, such as offering cycling adviser roles to allies like Andrew Gilligan in 2013 and attempting to place supporters in arts positions, breaching public appointment guidelines according to reports. These claims, often from left-leaning outlets skeptical of Conservative governance, contrasted with Johnson's efforts to foster cross-party cooperation on the Greater London Authority, where he navigated a Labour-majority assembly to advance initiatives like Olympic preparations, diverging from Westminster's partisan dynamics.

## Brexit advocacy and senior government roles

### 2016 EU referendum campaign

Johnson remained publicly undecided on the United Kingdom's European Union membership until early 2016, despite long-held skepticism toward deeper integration, before announcing his support for the Leave campaign on 21 February 2016. His decision defied Prime Minister David Cameron's efforts to secure Remain endorsements from senior Conservatives and positioned Johnson as a leading figure in the Vote Leave official campaign, alongside Michael Gove.

Central to Johnson's advocacy were arguments for restoring national sovereignty, emphasizing that EU membership entailed ceding control over 60% of British laws to unelected Brussels institutions and critiquing the trajectory toward a federal superstate. He highlighted immigration control as unfeasible under free movement rules, noting that EU inflows—net 184,000 in the year to June 2015—undermined domestic points-based systems and public service capacities. On economics, Johnson contested Remain's forecasts of severe GDP contraction, labeling them exaggerated "Project Fear" reliant on static models ignoring dynamic gains from deregulation and trade diversification outside the single market's regulatory burdens.

Johnson co-authored opinion pieces with Gove promoting the claim that the UK's gross weekly contribution to the EU—approximately £350 million—could be redirected to the National Health Service if membership ended, framing it as reclaimable funds rather than net after rebates. This slogan, emblazoned on Vote Leave's campaign bus, drew criticism for omitting rebate complexities but underscored arguments against budgetary transfers to a bloc seen as inefficient. Polling indicated Johnson's high-profile endorsement swayed undecided voters toward Leave, with surveys showing a post-announcement shift in Conservative-leaning demographics.

The referendum on 23 June 2016 resulted in 51.9% voting Leave against 48.1% for Remain, on a turnout of 72.2%, delivering the UK's first-ever rejection of continued EU membership. Johnson's rhetorical flair and focus on democratic control over borders and regulations were credited by Leave supporters for mobilizing turnout in key English regions, though subsequent analyses noted the narrow margin reflected polarized views on integration risks versus economic interdependence claims.

### Foreign Secretary (2016–2018)

Boris Johnson was appointed Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs on 13 July 2016 by Prime Minister Theresa May, shortly after her ascension following the Brexit referendum. In this role, he advocated for a "Global Britain" strategy emphasizing trade diversification and diplomatic outreach beyond Europe, including speeches highlighting new partnerships based on friendship and free trade. This approach marked a pragmatic shift from predecessors' EU-centric priorities, with increased Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) attention to regions like the Indo-Pacific to secure post-Brexit opportunities, though full policy articulation occurred later.

Johnson pursued trade missions and bilateral engagements to advance free trade agendas, visiting countries such as India in 2017 to strengthen economic ties and lay groundwork for future deals. His tenure involved controversial normalization efforts in unstable regions, exemplified by a 4 October 2017 remark during a Conservative conference fringe event suggesting the Libyan city of Sirte could become "the next Dubai" if authorities cleared away "the dead bodies"—a reference to ISIS remnants but widely criticized as insensitive amid ongoing instability and humanitarian crises. The comment drew rebukes from Downing Street and demands for apology from Libyan officials, highlighting tensions in Britain's Libya policy post-Gaddafi.

In foreign policy responses, Johnson played a key role in the March 2018 Salisbury poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia with Novichok nerve agent, attributing responsibility to Russia in a 8 April 2018 Sunday Times article stating "only Russia could have committed this crime" due to the agent's stockpiling and expertise. The UK expelled 23 Russian diplomats on 14 March 2018, coordinated with allies like the US and EU nations, in a robust diplomatic retaliation that strained UK-Russia relations but demonstrated alliance cohesion. However, gaffes undermined his diplomacy, including a prior 2016 limerick mocking Turkish President Erdogan—entered in a competition and implying bestiality—which complicated UK-Turkey ties upon his appointment, prompting ambassador summonses.

Tensions with Iran escalated due to verbal missteps, notably Johnson's 2017 comments on detained British-Iranian Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, whom he described as "teaching people journalism" in Iran—erroneously interpreted by Iranian courts as admission of subversive activity, prolonging her sentence despite his intent to criticize the conviction. A 6 April 2018 Spectator column comparing Muslim women in burqas to "letter boxes" or "bank robbers" further fueled perceptions of insensitivity, though made as a backbench contribution amid ongoing FS duties. These incidents, alongside pragmatic deals like 2017 Tehran meetings with Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, underscored causal frictions: gaffes invited exploitation by adversarial regimes, complicating consular efforts while Johnson's assertiveness aligned with confronting state threats.

Johnson resigned on 9 July 2018, citing in his letter to May that the Chequers Brexit agreement compromised core red lines, "suffocated by needless self-doubt," and undermined the "dream" of independent Global Britain policy. His departure, following Brexit Secretary David Davis's, reflected irreconcilable cabinet divisions over EU customs union concessions, prioritizing ideological consistency over tenure stability.

### Backbench period and 2019 leadership election

Following his resignation as Foreign Secretary on 9 July 2018 in opposition to Prime Minister Theresa May's Chequers agreement, which he described as a plan that "sticks in the throat," Johnson returned to the backbenches as the Member of Parliament for Uxbridge and South Ruislip. During this period, he maintained significant influence through weekly columns in *The Daily Telegraph*, where he repeatedly criticized May's Brexit strategy as overly timid and conciliatory toward the European Union, arguing it undermined the 2016 referendum mandate for a clean break. These writings, often framed as calls for bolder negotiations, kept Johnson prominent in public and party discourse amid mounting Conservative divisions over Brexit implementation.

Johnson entered the 2019 Conservative Party leadership contest following May's announcement on 24 May that she would resign as party leader, positioning himself as the candidate best equipped to deliver Brexit by the revised deadline of 31 October 2019. He secured endorsements from 114 MPs in the initial ballot on 13 June, outpacing rivals including Jeremy Hunt (43 votes) and establishing an early lead that reflected strong backing from both Brexiteer factions and moderates seeking party unity. His campaign emphasized readiness for a no-deal exit if negotiations failed, while pledging to pursue and finalize an "oven-ready" withdrawal agreement to avoid further delays, framing this as essential to restoring voter trust eroded under May.

Johnson's grassroots appeal was evident in reports of heightened party membership engagement during the contest, with his frontrunner status attributed to widespread perception among activists that he could unify the party around decisive Brexit delivery. He ultimately won the leadership on 23 July 2019 after defeating Hunt in the final member ballot, with 92,153 votes to Hunt's 77,336, enabling his appointment as prime minister. This outcome underscored Johnson's rehabilitation from backbench obscurity to party standard-bearer, driven by his media platform and perceived electability on the Brexit issue.

## Premiership (2019–2022)

### Path to power and 2019 general election

Johnson secured the Conservative Party leadership on 23 July 2019, defeating Jeremy Hunt in the final ballot conducted among party members. He was formally appointed Prime Minister by Queen Elizabeth II the following day, 24 July 2019, succeeding Theresa May after her resignation.  

In his initial actions as leader, Johnson executed a sweeping cabinet reshuffle on 24 July 2019, dismissing prominent critics of a no-deal Brexit outcome, such as Chancellor Philip Hammond, Justice Secretary David Gauke, and Work and Pensions Secretary Penny Mordaunt, while elevating Brexit supporters like Priti Patel to Home Secretary and Sajid Javid to Chancellor. This purge aimed to unify the government around delivering Brexit without further delays. Concurrently, he appointed Dominic Cummings, architect of the 2016 Vote Leave campaign, as chief special adviser to direct No. 10 strategy and implementation.  

With Brexit stalled in Parliament, Johnson requested and obtained legislative approval on 29 October 2019 to hold a general election on 12 December 2019, framing the contest around the slogan "Get Brexit Done" to underscore ending the impasse and shifting focus to domestic issues like the NHS. The campaign prioritized Leave-voting constituencies in traditional Labour strongholds across Northern England and the Midlands—termed the "Red Wall"—promising to honor the 2016 referendum result in these areas where support for departure had been strong but unfulfilled.  

The Conservatives achieved a decisive victory, capturing 365 seats with 43.6% of the vote, translating to an 80-seat majority—the party's largest since Margaret Thatcher's 102-seat win in 1987. This outcome reversed the 2017 hung parliament, where the party held only 317 seats reliant on a confidence-and-supply arrangement, by flipping numerous Red Wall seats from Labour, including long-held seats like Bishop Auckland and Workington, thereby securing a clear mandate to proceed with Brexit withdrawal.

### Brexit delivery and EU relations

Upon assuming the premiership in July 2019, Boris Johnson prioritized renegotiating the Withdrawal Agreement to eliminate the Irish backstop, which had been a major point of contention under Theresa May. His government secured a revised agreement on 17 October 2019, featuring a new protocol for Northern Ireland that aligned it with certain EU rules to avoid a hard Irish border while allowing the rest of the UK to exit the customs union. This deal replaced the backstop with time-limited arrangements and consent mechanisms for Northern Ireland's assembly, though the protocol later sparked unionist opposition and trade frictions within the UK internal market.

Johnson's administration withdrew the UK's request for an Article 50 extension on 19 October 2019 by pairing a legally required unsigned letter seeking delay with a signed one urging the EU against granting it, enabling pursuit of the revised terms without further postponement. Following the Conservative victory in the December 2019 general election, Parliament ratified the Withdrawal Agreement on 20 December 2019, paving the way for the UK's departure from the EU on 31 January 2020 and a transition period until 31 December 2020. The agreement restored UK sovereignty over its laws, borders, and waters, ending automatic EU jurisdiction and supranational decision-making, though critics highlighted the Northern Ireland Protocol's regulatory checks as compromising full divergence.

Negotiations culminated in the UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement, signed on 30 December 2020 and provisionally applied from 1 January 2021. This pact established zero-tariff, zero-quota trade for all goods meeting rules of origin, covering the vast majority of bilateral commerce while introducing non-tariff barriers such as customs declarations and sanitary checks. It formally ended free movement of people, replacing it with a points-based immigration system effective 1 January 2021, prioritizing skills, salary thresholds, and English proficiency over EU preferential access. Empirical assessments by the Office for Budget Responsibility indicate a long-term 4% reduction in UK potential productivity from diminished trade intensity, lower than some pre-referendum projections of deeper shocks under no-deal scenarios, reflecting the deal's role in averting tariffs but not frictionless trade.

Post-agreement EU relations involved implementing the deal amid disputes, particularly over Northern Ireland, leading to the 2023 Windsor Framework to ease checks, yet underscoring persistent tensions from divergent regulatory paths. Johnson's approach emphasized sovereignty gains—such as independent trade policy and lawmaking—offsetting bureaucratic costs, with UK exports adapting through compliance rather than reversion to WTO terms, though small firms reported higher administrative burdens.

### COVID-19 response

The Johnson government initially pursued a strategy of mitigating COVID-19 spread through voluntary measures and building herd immunity, with Chief Scientific Adviser Patrick Vallance publicly discussing allowing 60% of the population to become infected to achieve it, but this approach was abandoned by mid-March 2020 amid projections of over 250,000 deaths and scientific warnings of overwhelmed hospitals.  On 16 March 2020, the government imposed social distancing, school closures, and pub shutdowns; this escalated to the first nationwide lockdown on 23 March 2020, requiring people to stay home except for essential reasons. Subsequent lockdowns followed on 5 November 2020 (four-week national restrictions) and 4 January 2021 (third national lockdown until March), alongside tiered regional systems and Operation Moonshot, an ambitious mass testing initiative launched in September 2020 aiming for 10 million daily tests by early 2021 to enable safer reopenings, though pilots revealed high false negative rates (over 50% in some cases) and scalability issues, limiting its impact.  

The vaccine rollout, authorized starting with Pfizer-BioNTech on 2 December 2020 and first administered on 8 December, prioritized high-risk groups and achieved one of the world's fastest paces, with over 20 million first doses delivered by mid-February 2021 and approximately 50% of adults receiving at least one dose by April 2021, facilitated by extended intervals between doses (up to 12 weeks) and partnerships with the NHS.  This contributed to declining hospitalizations post-winter 2020-2021 peak, enabling phased reopenings under the "roadmap" from March 2021.

Empirically, the UK's response yielded around 200,000 excess deaths from March 2020 to end-2022, with per capita excess mortality higher than Nordic peers like Sweden (which avoided strict lockdowns) but lower than Italy or Spain among major European economies.  Lockdowns correlated with averting an estimated hundreds of thousands of direct COVID deaths per modeling, but imposed trade-offs including a 9.9% GDP contraction in 2020—the steepest since records began—and £400 billion in government support (e.g., furlough schemes covering 11 million workers at peak), equivalent to over 10% of pre-pandemic GDP.  School closures, lasting over 20 weeks cumulatively in England, led to learning losses of 1-2 months on average per international estimates, with PISA 2022 data showing UK students' math scores dropping 13-15 points from 2018 trends, disproportionately affecting disadvantaged pupils and exacerbating attainment gaps. 

In his October 2025 UK COVID-19 Inquiry testimony, Johnson defended the strategy's evolution as data-driven, rejecting claims of inadequate pre-pandemic preparation while acknowledging that school closures exacted a "huge price" on children to shield adults, and attributing planning shortfalls for education disruptions to the Department for Education rather than No. 10. Critics, including inquiry evidence, highlighted delays in initial action and inconsistent messaging, though excess mortality data suggest lockdowns mitigated worse outcomes seen in less-restricted peers like Sweden on a per capita basis, balanced against long-term economic scarring and educational harms.

### Domestic legislative agenda

Johnson's domestic legislative agenda emphasized economic deregulation, regional development, and law enforcement enhancements to foster post-Brexit growth and address regional disparities. Central to this was the Levelling Up White Paper, published on 2 February 2022, which outlined 12 missions targeting productivity, skills, connectivity, and health outcomes by 2030, with commitments to devolve powers and invest in infrastructure across the UK. The associated Levelling Up and Regeneration Bill, introduced in May 2022, sought to streamline planning and compel local authorities to align with national housing targets, though it encountered resistance over perceived centralization.

Planning reforms formed a core pillar, aiming to accelerate housing construction amid chronic shortages. In June 2020, Johnson announced a "New Deal for Britain" pledging £5 billion in accelerated infrastructure, including hospital upgrades and green projects, to stimulate recovery and bypass bureaucratic delays. Subsequent proposals in 2020-2021 targeted zoning changes to deem certain developments automatically permitted, reducing local vetoes, but faced backlash from rural constituencies opposing greenfield expansion. By September 2022, key elements were withdrawn due to internal Conservative Party divisions and "NIMBY" (Not In My Backyard) pressures from MPs in high-value southern seats, resulting in diluted reforms that prioritized brownfield sites over ambitious targets of 300,000 annual homes. This retreat highlighted tensions between deregulation's growth potential and political execution challenges, as local opposition stalled supply-side boosts essential for affordability.

To enable regulatory divergence from EU norms, the Retained EU Law (Revocation and Reform) Bill was introduced on 22 September 2022, mandating the expiry of most retained EU laws by 31 December 2023 unless explicitly preserved, while easing amendments to prioritize UK-specific economic needs like innovation in tech and finance. Proponents argued this would unlock deregulation benefits, such as streamlined environmental rules for infrastructure, though critics within business sectors warned of uncertainty during transition. On law and order, the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022, receiving royal assent on 28 April 2022, expanded stop-and-search powers, including suspicionless searches in designated zones for knife crime prevention, and increased sentences for disruptive protests. These measures aimed to enhance public safety amid rising urban violence, with empirical backing from prior stop-and-search correlations to weapon seizures, despite debates over disproportionality.

Infrastructure investments under the agenda included over £27 billion for roads and £5 billion fast-tracked post-2020, intended to bridge regional gaps via the "Build Back Better" framework. However, execution delays from planning bottlenecks and fiscal constraints limited impacts, contributing to uneven outcomes. UK GDP growth averaged approximately 0.2% annually from 2019 to mid-2022 when adjusted for the 2020 contraction, with a strong 7.5% rebound in 2021 but subdued momentum thereafter due to supply shocks and policy lags, underscoring the agenda's intent for supply-side stimulus against real-world implementation hurdles.

### Immigration and security policies

Upon assuming the premiership in July 2019, Boris Johnson oversaw the termination of freedom of movement with the European Union following Brexit, replacing it with a points-based immigration system effective from January 2021 that prioritized skilled workers through mandatory points allocation for job offers, salary thresholds, and English proficiency. This system, modeled in part on Australia's approach, awarded visas based on economic contributions rather than unrestricted EU access, aiming to reduce low-skilled inflows while maintaining labor market flexibility.

In 2022, Johnson's government enacted the Nationality and Borders Act, which received royal assent on 28 April and criminalized irregular entry into the UK, including Channel crossings by small boat, with penalties up to four years' imprisonment for facilitators and stricter asylum processing for those arriving unlawfully. The legislation sought to deter dangerous migrations by differentiating treatment between legal and illegal arrivals, imposing harsher conditions on the latter, such as potential offshore processing.

A cornerstone of these efforts was the Migration and Economic Development Partnership with Rwanda, announced by Johnson on 14 April 2022, under which asylum seekers entering irregularly after 1 January 2022 would be relocated to Rwanda for claim processing, with the UK funding operations estimated at £120 million initially. The policy explicitly drew from Australia's offshore processing model, which had reduced unauthorized boat arrivals from over 20,000 in 2013 to near zero by 2014 through deterrence, arguing that safe legal routes alone failed to stem people-smuggling networks exploiting humanitarian interpretations. The first deportation flight, scheduled for 14 July 2022 carrying 39 individuals, was grounded hours before takeoff following an injunction from the European Court of Human Rights, highlighting judicial barriers despite government assertions of Rwanda's safety for processing.

Empirically, while overall net migration surged to 745,000 in 2022—driven primarily by expanded legal humanitarian schemes for Ukrainians (post-24 February Russian invasion) and Hong Kong residents, alongside post-COVID student and health worker inflows—the policy announcements correlated with a subsequent decline in small boat crossings from a peak of 45,755 in 2022 to 29,437 in 2023, a 36% reduction attributable in part to heightened deterrence perceptions amid heightened enforcement rhetoric. Critics, often from advocacy groups and opposition aligned with international human rights frameworks, contended the measures undermined asylum protections, yet comparable Australian data demonstrated that deterrence via removal policies curbed illegal maritime attempts without proportionally increasing legal applications, prioritizing border sovereignty over unchecked inflows.

### Foreign policy engagements

Johnson's government emphasized a strategic "tilt" to the Indo-Pacific region, as outlined in the 2021 Integrated Review of Security, Defence, Development and Foreign Policy, which identified the area as central to global economic and security dynamics amid rising challenges from authoritarian states. This shift involved enhanced naval deployments, carrier strike group operations, and deepened alliances to counterbalance threats, including from China, described as presenting a "systemic challenge" through economic coercion and military expansionism. UK defence spending was projected to reach 2.2% of GDP by 2023, supporting these commitments with investments in high-technology capabilities like Type 26 frigates and increased munitions stockpiles.

In response to China's imposition of a national security law in Hong Kong in June 2020, Johnson extended a visa route to British National (Overseas) passport holders and their dependents, potentially affecting up to 3 million individuals, allowing a five-year stay with work and study rights leading to settlement and citizenship. The scheme launched on 31 January 2021, honoring a historical UK commitment while signaling opposition to erosion of freedoms in the former colony.

The administration championed the AUKUS partnership, announced on 15 September 2021 with the United States and Australia, to enhance nuclear-powered submarine capabilities and integrated deterrence in the Indo-Pacific against shared security concerns. This trilateral accord aimed to bolster technological and operational interoperability, reflecting Johnson's vision of post-Brexit "Global Britain" alliances beyond Europe.

Following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, the UK imposed its largest-ever sanctions package, targeting major banks like VTB, oligarchs in Putin's inner circle, and dual-use exports, while prohibiting asset holdings and financial services access. Johnson committed £2.3 billion in military aid by mid-2022, including an additional £1 billion package announced at the NATO Madrid Summit on 30 June, encompassing advanced weaponry and training to support Ukrainian defenses.

On Afghanistan, amid the Taliban's rapid advance in August 2021, Operation Pitting evacuated over 15,000 people from Kabul via 100 flights before the 31 August deadline, with Johnson deploying 800 additional troops and urging G7 coordination for safe passage and humanitarian aid. The effort prioritized vulnerable allies but faced logistical constraints tied to the US withdrawal timeline.

Post-Brexit trade initiatives included applying to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) on 1 February 2021, launching formal negotiations on 22 June, and pursuing a free trade agreement with India, with talks initiated on 12 January 2022 aiming for completion by October, focusing on tariff reductions for goods like whisky and textiles alongside visa flexibilities.

### Key controversies and resignation

During the COVID-19 lockdowns, revelations in December 2021 about multiple social gatherings at 10 Downing Street, including a June 19, 2020, event marking Johnson's birthday, led to the "Partygate" scandal. The Metropolitan Police investigated and issued Johnson fixed-penalty notices on April 12, 2022, for attending that birthday gathering—where he was present for about 20 minutes—and a separate December 18, 2020, event, making him the first prime minister fined for breaking his own laws. Johnson apologized in the House of Commons on May 4, 2022, stating the events were brief and work-related but acknowledging public anger. The independent Sue Gray report, published in full on May 25, 2022, after police concluded their probe, criticized a "failure of leadership" and "excessive" alcohol consumption fostering a culture of disregard for rules, though it found no evidence of criminality beyond the fines already issued and noted limitations in its non-disciplinary scope. Johnson defended the gatherings as essential for morale amid intense workloads, claiming media coverage exaggerated their scale compared to frontline compliance efforts.

In November 2021, the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner ruled that Conservative MP Owen Paterson had committed "serious and repeated" breaches of lobbying rules by advocating for two private firms paying him £100,000 annually. Johnson initially backed a government amendment to the standards committee's proposed 30-day suspension, aiming to replace it with a review, but withdrew it on November 7 amid cross-party backlash and internal Tory dissent, admitting on November 17 it was a "total mistake" that damaged trust. Paterson resigned his seat on November 4, triggering a by-election loss for Conservatives, with critics attributing the episode to perceived favoritism toward MPs with second jobs.

The Pincher scandal erupted on June 30, 2022, when Deputy Chief Whip Chris Pincher resigned after allegations of drunkenly groping two men at a private club, prompting claims Johnson had ignored prior complaints about Pincher's conduct dating to 2019. Downing Street initially stated Johnson was unaware of specific allegations before Pincher's February 2022 appointment, but reports emerged he had been briefed on unspecified issues, leading to accusations of misleading Parliament. This triggered a wave of ministerial resignations, including Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Health Secretary Sajid Javid on July 5, escalating to over 50 by July 7—many citing eroded trust in Johnson's judgment.

These events compounded earlier pressures, including a June 6, 2022, Conservative 1922 Committee confidence vote where 211 MPs expressed no confidence against 148 supporting him, allowing survival but exposing divisions. YouGov polls reflected a net approval plunge from +28 in December 2019 to -42 by May 2022, correlating with Partygate fines and inquiries, though defenders argued policy achievements like vaccine rollout mitigated media-driven narrative amplification. Johnson resigned as prime minister on July 7, 2022, stating he could no longer govern effectively amid the mutiny, though he maintained the scandals were overblown relative to Brexit and economic delivery.

## Post-premiership activities (2022–present)

### Memoir publication and writings

In October 2024, Johnson published *Unleashed*, a 784-page memoir recounting his premiership and defending policies such as Brexit implementation and the COVID-19 response, while critiquing successors including Rishi Sunak for undermining his leadership and attributing party divisions to establishment resistance. The book, released on 10 October by William Collins in the UK and HarperCollins in the US, emphasized themes of personal optimism against institutional pessimism, portraying Johnson's tenure as a triumph of democratic will over elite skepticism.

Johnson secured a reported advance of approximately £2 million for the memoir, part of a deal signed in early 2023, reflecting high commercial expectations for his insider account despite criticisms of its selective narrative from outlets like *The Guardian*. Initial sales reached 42,528 copies in the first week, topping UK bestseller charts and outperforming competitors like Richard Osman, though figures dropped to 15,945 in the second week amid reports of underwhelming performance relative to the advance.

Post-premiership, Johnson resumed regular columns for *The Daily Telegraph*, where he has historically addressed political and cultural issues with irreverent prose, continuing a style that prioritizes contrarian optimism over conventional analysis. This output aligns with his earlier historiography, such as *The Churchill Factor* (2014), which reframed Winston Churchill's legacy through pragmatic leadership amid crisis, influencing Johnson's post-2022 defenses of bold governance against bureaucratic inertia. In 2025, Johnson disclosed using AI tools like ChatGPT to assist in book writing, describing it as "frankly fantastic" for enhancing productivity while affirming human oversight in final content.

### Business ventures and lobbying

Following his resignation as prime minister in September 2022, Boris Johnson engaged in paid speaking engagements, reportedly earning over £5 million from such activities within the first six months, including a £2.5 million advance from the Harry Walker Agency for future events.  These fees, often exceeding £30,000 per hour for select appearances, aligned with rates commanded by former leaders leveraging post-office prestige, though critics argued they reflected undue monetization of public service experience. Johnson disclosed these earnings via parliamentary registers, maintaining compliance with disclosure rules, while comparable figures for predecessors like Tony Blair—whose post-premiership consulting firm earned tens of millions—suggest such practices as established norms rather than anomalies.

In May 2024, Johnson assumed the role of co-chair at Better Earth Ltd, a climate consultancy focused on net-zero advisory services for governments and firms, following clearance from the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (ACOBA).  The firm, backed by figures including former Tory MP Chris Skidmore, aimed to assist nations in green transitions, with Johnson pitching its services to Saudi officials in early 2024. This included a February lunch with Saudi Commerce Minister Majid al-Qasabi—previously hosted at Downing Street—and draft letters to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in March, proposing Better Earth's expertise for Saudi's Vision 2030 environmental goals, framed as advisory without guaranteed contracts. Johnson defended these as permissible after the two-year "cooling-off" period for ex-ministers, citing ACOBA guidance, though subsequent probes identified potential rule breaches in timing and introductions.

A September 2025 leak dubbed the "Boris Files"—comprising over 1,800 documents from Johnson's private office, including emails, contracts, and diaries—exposed extensive lobbying efforts targeting foreign leaders and entities built on premiership networks. The files detailed approaches to UAE officials for a billion-dollar BIA Advisory climate venture, akin to Saudi overtures, and raised questions over undisclosed meetings with uranium lobbyists predating Better Earth involvement. They also highlighted scrutiny of Post Office-related dealings, though specifics centered on broader commercial pursuits rather than direct policy influence. Johnson rejected claims of impropriety, asserting all activities post-dated ACOBA approvals and separated public duties from private gain, amid calls for National Audit Office review given the files' implications for ethics rules.

Empirical data from official records show Johnson claimed £182,000 in Public Duty Costs Allowance (PDCA) funds between 2022 and 2025 to subsidize private office staff salaries, capped at £115,000 annually for ex-prime ministerial public roles like speeches and constituency work. Leaked documents suggested overlap, with staff allegedly handling commercial tasks on taxpayer time, prompting accusations of cronyism and subsidy misuse comparable to precedents under Blair's post-office empire. Cabinet Office sources confirmed PDCA eligibility tied strictly to public duties, yet Johnson maintained separation, with no formal findings of fraud as of October 2025; defenders noted similar allowances for all living ex-PMs totaling nearly £10 million, underscoring systemic rather than isolated incentives for blending roles.

### Public interventions and inquiries

Following his resignation as prime minister in July 2022, Johnson has maintained a visible media presence, including appearances on GB News where he critiqued Reform UK's polling prospects and described the party as polling at less than ten percent in some areas. In October 2025, he endorsed stronger Western resolve in supporting Ukraine against Russian aggression, urging greater commitment amid perceived waning British interest and implicitly criticizing Labour's approach for insufficient enthusiasm over Ukrainian military advances. He has not rejoined the Conservative Party formally as of October 2025, though polls indicate varying levels of support among 2024 Conservative voters for a potential leadership return, with some surveys showing him as a slight public favorite in contingency scenarios.

In an October 2025 interview, Johnson expressed enthusiasm for artificial intelligence, describing ChatGPT as "frankly fantastic" for assisting in book writing and suggesting its potential to reduce government costs, such as in infrastructure projects like HS2. He highlighted AI's utility in simplifying complex tasks, stating it benefits society because "we're all simple."

Johnson provided testimony to the UK COVID-19 Inquiry on 21 October 2025 during Module 8, focusing on the pandemic's impact on children and education. He rejected claims that his government failed to prepare for school closures, attributing shortcomings to the Department for Education while defending the measures as necessary to control COVID-19 transmission, though he acknowledged children paid a "huge, huge price" to protect the rest of society. Johnson testified that he had hoped to avoid closures, calling the prospect a "nightmare idea," and emphasized the rapid development and rollout of vaccines as a key achievement in mitigating long-term harms.

### Family and personal updates

In July 2023, Johnson and his wife Carrie welcomed their third child together, a son named Frank Alfred Odysseus Johnson. The birth was announced by Carrie Johnson on social media, highlighting the family's continued expansion following their earlier children Wilfred (born 2020) and Romy (born 2021).

On 21 May 2025, the couple announced the birth of their fourth child, a daughter named Poppy Eliza Josephine Johnson, marking Johnson's ninth known child overall. Carrie Johnson shared the news via Instagram, noting both mother and baby were "doing well" after a home birth, consistent with her pattern of public updates on family milestones. These announcements reflect ongoing family growth amid Johnson's post-premiership life.

The Johnsons reside at Brightwell Manor, a £3.8 million property in rural Oxfordshire, providing a countryside setting for raising their children away from central London. This relocation supports a more private family environment, with Carrie Johnson occasionally posting glimpses of domestic life, such as outings and home activities, on social media.

Johnson maintains co-parenting arrangements with his ex-wife Marina Wheeler for their four adult children, though specific post-2022 developments remain private and unpublicized in available reports. No major health incidents have been reported for Johnson since his premiership, with family updates centering on these parental responsibilities.

## Political ideology and views

### Economic and conservative principles

Johnson espoused free-market principles influenced by Margaret Thatcher, emphasizing the role of competition and inequality in driving innovation and economic dynamism. In a 2013 speech to the Centre for Policy Studies, he argued that greed and envy foster enterprise, stating that "slightly wrong, even unfair" inequality is necessary for progress, thereby positioning himself as a successor to Thatcher's legacy of deregulation and individualism. This view rested on causal reasoning that lower barriers to ambition incentivize productivity, as evidenced by Thatcher's privatization and union reforms which correlated with GDP growth averaging 2.5% annually from 1979 to 1990, though subsequent analyses note increased inequality without proportional broad-based gains.

As prime minister, Johnson advocated low taxes and deregulation to stimulate investment, pledging to reduce the corporation tax rate from 19%—inherited from prior governments—to 15% or lower if fiscal conditions permitted, arguing such cuts would attract business and boost revenues through expanded activity.  However, he shelved immediate reductions in November 2019 to allocate £6 billion toward public services, prioritizing electoral spending over immediate fiscal conservatism, a decision critiqued by free-market advocates for undermining growth incentives.  His administration maintained the 19% rate initially but oversaw reversals through later increases, reflecting a pragmatic deviation from pure Thatcherite austerity amid post-pandemic recovery demands.

Johnson's post-Brexit economic vision, dubbed "Singapore-on-Thames," envisioned the UK as a low-tax, lightly regulated hub akin to Singapore's model, where corporate tax rates below 17% and streamlined bureaucracy have sustained GDP per capita growth exceeding 4% annually since 2000 by drawing foreign direct investment.  He promoted this through policies like establishing eight free ports in March 2021, offering tax relief and customs exemptions to spur regional development, empirically linked in prior UK enterprise zones to localized job creation of up to 20,000 positions per zone via reduced planning hurdles.  Critics, often from interventionist perspectives, warned of heightened inequality risks, citing Singapore's Gini coefficient of 0.458 indicating stark wealth disparities, though Johnson countered that such models empirically outperform high-regulation economies in overall prosperity.

While skeptical of over-regulation stifling innovation—evident in his calls to slash red tape for supply-side reform—Johnson balanced this with targeted state intervention during crises, such as the £410 billion COVID-19 furlough scheme to preserve jobs, reasoning that temporary supports prevent market collapse and enable faster recovery, as UK unemployment peaked at 4.5% in late 2020 before rebounding.  This approach diverged from rigid laissez-faire by acknowledging causal disruptions from exogenous shocks, yet maintained conservative priors favoring private enterprise over permanent expansion of public spending, which he viewed as distorting incentives.

### Views on the European Union and immigration

Boris Johnson articulated Eurosceptic positions centered on the European Union's encroachment on British sovereignty, portraying it as an evolving supranational entity imposing regulations that stifled national autonomy. During the 2016 Brexit referendum campaign, he argued that membership subordinated UK laws to unelected Brussels institutions, advocating withdrawal to enable independent trade deals and policy-making. In his January 31, 2020, address marking the UK's formal exit, Johnson declared that the EU had developed over 50 years into a framework no longer fitting Britain, framing departure as an opportunity for "national renewal" through restored parliamentary supremacy over legislation. He emphasized that post-Brexit, British laws would be enacted solely by the UK Parliament, free from the customs union and single market constraints.

Johnson linked EU membership to inadequate border controls, asserting that free movement facilitated uncontrolled immigration incompatible with sustainable integration. He criticized the bloc's one-size-fits-all approach for overriding national preferences on migrant selection, which he contended eroded public trust and strained resources without commensurate economic benefits from low-skilled inflows. Sovereignty restoration via Brexit, in his view, causally enabled bespoke policies prioritizing high-skill entrants over volume-driven migration.

On immigration policy, Johnson championed an Australian-style points-based system to favor skilled, economically productive migrants while curbing low-skill entries. In a June 2019 leadership bid pledge, he committed to implementing this model to "take back control" post-Brexit, arguing it would align inflows with labor needs and integration capacity. By November 2020, as prime minister, he announced its rollout from January 1, 2021, replacing EU free movement with criteria rewarding qualifications, English proficiency, and job offers, though subsequent net migration rises from non-EU sources—reaching 745,000 in 2022—highlighted implementation challenges amid global pressures like Ukraine and Hong Kong schemes. Johnson maintained that such a system, grounded in empirical labor market data, better served sovereignty than supranational mandates.

### Unionism, environment, and devolution

Johnson positioned himself as a staunch defender of the United Kingdom's union, particularly emphasizing opposition to a second Scottish independence referendum. In January 2020, shortly after assuming the premiership, he formally rejected the Scottish government's request for a new vote, arguing it would distract from post-Brexit priorities and economic recovery. He reiterated this stance in May 2021, describing an independence referendum amid the COVID-19 pandemic as "irresponsible and reckless," and in July 2022, he informed First Minister Nicola Sturgeon that "now is not the time" for such a poll, prioritizing national unity and recovery efforts. These positions aligned with empirical polling data showing sustained unionist majorities in Scotland, though critics from nationalist quarters accused him of overriding devolved democratic preferences.

On Northern Ireland, Johnson sought to safeguard unionist interests amid Brexit's fallout, particularly through adjustments to the Northern Ireland Protocol agreed in 2019. Despite initial assurances of "no checks" on goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, post-implementation frictions—such as customs barriers perceived to diverge the region economically from the rest of the UK—prompted unionist backlash and supply chain disruptions. In response, his government in 2022 proposed the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill to enable unilateral overrides of certain EU-derived rules, aiming to minimize trade barriers while preserving the open Irish border; this included floated options for temporary alignment with EU food standards to ease practical issues. Johnson framed these measures as essential to upholding the union's integrity against protocol-induced strains, though the approach drew legal challenges from the EU and accusations of breaching international law from sources like the European Commission, highlighting tensions between contractual fidelity and pragmatic union preservation.

Johnson's environmental policy emphasized a commitment to net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, enshrined in UK law via the 2019 Climate Change Act amendments, with his administration advancing implementation through the October 2021 Net Zero Strategy. This document outlined sector-specific decarbonization paths, projecting 440,000 green jobs and £90 billion in private investment by 2030, complemented by the November 2020 Ten Point Plan targeting offshore wind, hydrogen, and nuclear expansion. As host of COP26 in Glasgow from November 1-12, 2021, he urged global leaders to treat the summit as a "one-minute-to-midnight" imperative, pushing for enhanced nationally determined contributions and fossil fuel phase-down pledges, though outcomes fell short of full coal elimination commitments. Pragmatically, however, Johnson resisted expanding fracking despite energy security pressures from the 2022 Russia-Ukraine crisis, maintaining the 2019 moratorium and critiquing exaggerated claims of its viability, prioritizing renewables and nuclear over what he viewed as seismically disruptive domestic gas extraction. This balance reflected causal trade-offs: accelerating net zero risked short-term energy vulnerabilities, as evidenced by rising wholesale prices, yet empirical data from the strategy underscored pathways reliant on proven low-carbon technologies rather than unproven shale yields.

Regarding devolution, Johnson advocated a model of empowered regions under central oversight to prevent fragmentation, critiquing excessive autonomy as a "disaster" in a November 2020 interview, attributing issues like policy divergences to over-devolved powers without sufficient national coordination. Empirically, his government increased funding to devolved administrations via the Barnett formula and targeted allocations; for instance, Scotland received an estimated £1.1 billion NHS boost from the 2021 health levy rise, contributing to overall block grant uplifts amid COVID-19 responses. Initiatives like the £4.8 billion Levelling Up Fund extended investments to English regions and devolved areas, though Scottish and Welsh governments criticized it as encroaching on their fiscal competencies by bypassing Holyrood and Cardiff for project approvals. This approach aimed to foster UK-wide convergence—evidenced by per capita funding disparities narrowing slightly under Conservative fiscal policies—while retaining Westminster vetoes on constitutional referendums, underscoring a realist view that devolution's causal risks to unity outweighed unchecked regional experimentation.

## Public image and reception

### Popularity and charisma

Johnson's public approval reached notable highs during the 2019 general election campaign, with Ipsos polls indicating favourability levels that contrasted sharply with later declines, reflecting strong voter support amid Brexit negotiations. YouGov data from the period showed him leading Conservative membership preferences with 66% backing upon assuming party leadership, translating to broad appeal that propelled the party to victory. This culminated in the Conservatives securing 43.6% of the national vote and an 80-seat majority in the House of Commons on December 12, 2019, marking their largest parliamentary win since 1987.

Central to this success was Johnson's "BoJo" persona, characterized by a disheveled appearance, self-deprecating humor, and allusions to classical antiquity, which resonated with working-class voters in traditional Labour strongholds known as the "Red Wall." Empirical evidence from the election results demonstrates gains in leave-voting, post-industrial constituencies, where his anti-elite rhetoric—framed around "getting Brexit done"—outperformed opponents despite his Eton and Oxford pedigree. Polling analysis post-election attributes this shift to his positioning as an outsider challenging metropolitan establishment views, appealing across socioeconomic lines by blending patrician background with pub-league familiarity.

His media savvy, honed as a Telegraph correspondent and television personality, amplified visibility through memorable soundbites and appearances that humanized his image, fostering perceptions of authenticity over polished professionalism. Voter surveys from 2019 highlight how this charisma mitigated personal unfavourability metrics—lower than predecessors on election day—by prioritizing policy delivery on Brexit, enabling cross-class mobilization in England's northern and midland seats.

### Criticisms of competence and integrity

Johnson faced accusations of dishonesty dating back to the 1990s, when he was dismissed from his position as a reporter for *The Times* after fabricating a quote attributed to his godfather, the archaeologist Colin Lucas, in a story about the Archaeological Association's alleged cover-up of findings on ancient Troy. During his tenure as Prime Minister, critics highlighted repeated instances of misleading statements, including claims during the 2016 EU referendum campaign that were later challenged in court as "irresponsible and dishonest." In the 2019 Conservative leadership contest, opponents such as Jeremy Hunt described him as "cowardly, untrustworthy," reflecting concerns among party members about his reliability.

The Partygate scandal exemplified allegations of rule-bending, involving gatherings in Downing Street during COVID-19 lockdowns that violated restrictions imposed by Johnson's own government; he received a fixed penalty notice from the Metropolitan Police for attending one such event on June 19, 2020. A 2023 House of Commons Privileges Committee report concluded that Johnson "deliberately misled" Parliament by asserting that "the guidance was followed and the rules were followed at all times," despite evidence of breaches, leading to his resignation as an MP to avoid potential suspension. Left-leaning outlets amplified these as evidence of systemic dishonesty, while defenders argued they reflected media overreach amid broader governmental achievements like vaccine rollout.

Critics questioned Johnson's competence in policy delivery, particularly the "levelling up" agenda promised in the 2019 manifesto to reduce regional inequalities through infrastructure and investment in northern England. The Public Accounts Committee reported in 2024 that the government provided "no compelling examples" of successful outcomes from the Levelling Up Fund, citing delays, poor targeting, and underspending, with only a fraction of allocated £4.8 billion disbursed by March 2023. Empirical assessments, including from the Institute for Fiscal Studies, noted failures in measurable progress on metrics like productivity gaps, attributing issues to inconsistent funding and coordination lapses under Johnson's administration. Right-leaning perspectives countered that such critiques ignored external factors like post-Brexit trade disruptions and pandemic effects, positioning Johnson's approach as a necessary disruption to entrenched bureaucratic inertia.

Post-Partygate polls indicated widespread perceptions of untrustworthiness, with YouGov surveys in February 2022 showing 75% of Britons viewing Johnson as untrustworthy, up from prior levels, correlating with declining approval amid ongoing inquiries. However, electoral data provided a counterpoint: despite these scandals, Johnson's Conservatives secured a landslide victory in the December 2019 general election with 43.6% of the vote and 365 seats, suggesting voter prioritization of Brexit delivery over personal integrity concerns. Comparative analysis of prime ministerial trust metrics, such as those from Ipsos, revealed Johnson's net trust ratings lagged behind predecessors like Tony Blair in early terms but aligned with patterns where voters forgave perceived flaws for policy results, as evidenced by his survival in office until July 2022. Left-wing commentary framed this as chaotic governance eroding institutional norms, whereas right-wing views portrayed it as bold pragmatism enabling reforms like no-deal Brexit preparations, with public forgiveness reflected in 2021 local election gains despite integrity probes.

### Media portrayal and cultural impact

Johnson's portrayal in British media exhibited a stark partisan divide, with left-leaning outlets like the BBC and satirical programs such as *Have I Got News for You* frequently depicting him as a jovial buffoon whose disheveled appearance and gaffes underscored incompetence, a characterization that intensified amid scandals like Partygate. This framing aligned with broader systemic left-wing biases in mainstream media and academia, which prioritized narratives of personal flaws over policy successes, as evidenced by consistent emphasis on his "blathering, chaotic" style in commentary from figures like Piers Morgan. In contrast, conservative publications such as *The Daily Telegraph*—where Johnson wrote a weekly column reaching audiences via the paper's approximately 300,000 daily print circulation plus digital subscribers—portrayed him as a charismatic, Churchillian leader capable of rallying the nation through Brexit and the COVID-19 response.

Satirical treatments amplified this buffoon archetype, notably in *Private Eye*, whose prime ministerial parodies rendered Johnson unserious through exaggerated depictions of his rumpled persona and verbal slips, with these sketches achieving cultural permeation beyond the magazine's 200,000+ fortnightly circulation by influencing public discourse and comedy sketches. Such parodies, while boosting Johnson's fame as an entertaining figure, often reinforced elite media skepticism, yet empirical metrics like his £275,000 annual *Telegraph* salary for roughly 10 hours monthly writing underscored the commercial value of his voice to right-leaning audiences.

Culturally, Johnson inspired memes centered on his tousled hair, Latin quips, and phrases like "let the bodies pile high," which proliferated on social platforms and encapsulated his populist appeal, while books such as *Led by Donkeys* documented guerrilla protests quoting his own words against him, highlighting his role in polarizing artistic responses to Brexit. His deployment of parodic humor—mimicking pop culture to bond with voters—exemplified a strategy adopted by global populists, fostering emotional connections amid distrust of elites and influencing figures from Trump to emerging leaders in Europe. Post-premiership, this sustained interest manifested in documentaries like *The Rise and Fall of Boris Johnson* (2024), which traced his trajectory from scandal to downfall, reflecting his enduring grip on public imagination.

## Personal life

### Marriages and relationships

Johnson's first marriage was to Allegra Mostyn-Owen, whom he met while studying at the University of Oxford; the couple wed on 5 September 1987 when both were 23, and the union ended in divorce in 1993 following a separation in 1990. The marriage dissolved amid Johnson's developing relationship with Marina Wheeler, a childhood acquaintance and barrister, whom he subsequently married in July 1993, shortly after his divorce from Mostyn-Owen was finalized.

Johnson and Wheeler separated in September 2018 after 25 years of marriage, with the divorce finalized in May 2020; Wheeler later stated that she initiated the end of the marriage as it had become "impossible" due to the strains of Johnson's career demands and personal conduct. The couple's separation followed public reports of Johnson's extramarital affairs, including one in 2004 that led to his dismissal from a shadow cabinet role by Michael Howard, and another acknowledged liaison that resulted in the birth of a child in 2009.

In late 2018, Johnson entered a relationship with Carrie Symonds, a Conservative Party communications director 24 years his junior; the pair's partnership became publicly known in June 2019 when police responded to reports of an altercation at his London home. They announced their engagement in February 2020 and married in a private ceremony at Westminster Cathedral on 29 May 2021. Symonds, later Carrie Johnson, has faced scrutiny over her reported influence on Johnson's policy decisions, particularly regarding environmental issues, though such claims remain debated without direct causal evidence from primary accounts.

### Children and family dynamics

Boris Johnson is the father of at least nine children, born between 1993 and 2025. With his second wife, Marina Wheeler, he has four children: daughter Lara Lettice (born 1993), son Milo Arthur (born 1995), daughter Cassia Peaches (born 1997), and son Theodore Apollo (born 2000). He also fathered a daughter, Stephanie Louise (born 2009), with arts consultant Helen Macintyre; Johnson initially denied paternity but acknowledged it following a 2020 court ruling. With his third wife, Carrie Johnson (née Symonds), he has four children: son Wilfred Lawrie Nicholas Martin (born 29 April 2020), daughter Romy Iris (born December 2021), son Frank Alfred Odysseus (born July 2023), and daughter Poppy Eliza Josephine (born 21 May 2025).

Johnson's involvement as a father spans a blended family structure, with children from multiple relationships requiring co-parenting arrangements. He has described changing "a lot of nappies" across his offspring and maintains contact with those from his marriage to Wheeler, despite the couple's 2020 divorce finalized on grounds of his adultery. Public statements indicate ongoing paternal roles, including time spent with Wheeler's children during his premiership, though details of formal custody remain private.

Intra-family relations feature notable tensions alongside enduring bonds, particularly among Johnson's siblings. His younger brother, Jo Johnson (Baron Johnson of Marylebone), a former Conservative MP and universities minister, resigned from government in September 2019 over Brexit disagreements with Boris, highlighting sibling rivalry rooted in policy divides; Jo had campaigned for Remain, contrasting Boris's leadership of the Leave campaign. Sister Rachel Johnson, a journalist and environmental advocate aligned with the Green Party, has publicly criticized Boris as "tasteless" and "reprehensible" during Brexit debates, yet family solidarity persisted, as evidenced by joint support during Boris's 2020 hospitalization for COVID-19. Their father, Stanley Johnson, a former MEP and prominent environmentalist who authored works on conservation and praised Extinction Rebellion activists in 2019—contrasting Boris's initial dismissal of such protesters as "crusties"—nonetheless maintained public alignment with his son on broader family matters.

Post-2019 election, the Johnson family increased visibility through shared photographs, including birth announcements for Carrie Johnson's children and holiday images from 2025 depicting Boris with Wilfred, Romy, Frank, and Poppy in Greece, signaling cohesive public presentation amid private complexities. These glimpses underscore efforts to portray family unity, even as political divergences with siblings like Jo and Rachel occasionally surfaced in media.

### Religious and ancestral background

Boris Johnson was born on 19 June 1964 in New York City to British parents, Stanley Johnson, an economist studying at Columbia University, and Charlotte Fawcett, a painter, granting him dual British-American citizenship at birth, which he renounced in 2016. He was baptized as an infant into the Roman Catholic Church at his mother's insistence but, during his time at Eton College, renounced Catholicism and was confirmed in the Anglican Church of England, reflecting an early shift influenced by his schooling.

Johnson has described his personal faith as inconsistent and non-devout, with no evidence of regular religious practice throughout his adult life; he has self-identified as a "very, very bad Christian" while acknowledging Christianity's value as an ethical framework, though his commitments appear cultural rather than doctrinal. In writings and interviews, he has expressed agnostic leanings, once calling himself a "blockhead agnostic," and emphasized a vague, non-orthodox affinity for Christian principles without fervent observance.

His ancestry is notably diverse, tracing Ottoman Muslim roots through his paternal great-grandfather Ali Kemal, a journalist and briefly interior minister in the early Turkish Republic who was lynched in 1922 amid political turmoil. Maternal lineage includes Jewish heritage via a great-grandparent, alongside Christian forebears, contributing to Johnson's self-description as a "one-man melting pot" of religious backgrounds without dominant personal adherence to any.
