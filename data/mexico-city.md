## Introduction

Mexico City, officially known as *Ciudad de México* (CDMX), is the capital and largest city of Mexico. It serves as the political, cultural, and economic heart of the nation, located in the Valley of Mexico in the central part of the country. With a population of over 9 million in the city proper and more than 21 million in the greater metropolitan area, it is one of the largest urban agglomerations in the Western Hemisphere [INEGI Population Data](https://www.inegi.org.mx/). Founded by the Aztecs in 1325 as Tenochtitlan, the city has a rich history that blends indigenous heritage with colonial and modern influences. Today, Mexico City is a global metropolis, known for its vibrant culture, historical landmarks, and complex urban challenges.

## Historical Background

### Pre-Columbian Era
Mexico City's origins trace back to the founding of Tenochtitlan by the Mexica (Aztec) people in 1325. According to legend, the Aztecs settled on an island in Lake Texcoco after seeing an eagle perched on a cactus, fulfilling a prophecy. Tenochtitlan grew into a powerful city-state, becoming the center of the Aztec Empire by the 15th century. The city was a marvel of engineering, with causeways, canals, and chinampas (floating gardens) sustaining a population of over 200,000 at its peak [Smith, Michael E. - Aztec City](https://www.britannica.com/place/Tenochtitlan).

### Colonial Period
In 1519, Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés arrived, leading to the fall of Tenochtitlan in 1521 after a brutal siege. The Spanish razed much of the Aztec capital and built a colonial city atop its ruins, renaming it *México*. The city became the capital of New Spain, a vast colonial territory. Catholic churches, palaces, and administrative buildings, such as the Metropolitan Cathedral, were constructed using stones from Aztec temples. This period also saw the blending of indigenous and European cultures, evident in the city's architecture and demographics [Burke, Edmund - History of New Spain](https://www.loc.gov/resource/gdcwdl.wdl_10662/).

### Independence and Modern History
Mexico City played a central role in Mexico's struggle for independence from Spain, achieved in 1821. It became the capital of the new nation and witnessed significant events, including the Mexican-American War (1846–1848) and the Reform War (1857–1861). During the 20th century, the city expanded rapidly due to industrialization and rural-to-urban migration. The 1968 Summer Olympics, hosted in Mexico City, marked its emergence on the global stage, though the event was marred by the Tlatelolco Massacre, where government forces killed student protesters [1968 Olympics - Historical Context](https://www.olympic.org/mexico-1968). The devastating 1985 earthquake, which killed thousands and destroyed parts of the city, underscored the need for better urban planning and disaster preparedness [USGS Earthquake Report](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/usp0002h7v/executive).

## Current Status and Relevance

Mexico City is a major global city, serving as the political capital of Mexico and the seat of its federal government. It is home to key institutions, including the National Palace, the Supreme Court, and the Congress of the Union. Economically, it contributes significantly to Mexico's GDP, with industries ranging from finance and manufacturing to tourism and technology [World Bank - Mexico Economy](https://data.worldbank.org/country/mexico). Culturally, it is a hub for art, music, and literature, with institutions like the Palacio de Bellas Artes and a thriving street art scene.

However, the city faces significant challenges, including air pollution, traffic congestion, and water scarcity due to its location on a drained lakebed. Social inequality is also pronounced, with affluent neighborhoods contrasting sharply with sprawling informal settlements. Despite these issues, Mexico City remains a dynamic center of innovation, with initiatives to improve public transportation (e.g., the Metrobús system) and sustainability efforts gaining traction [Mexico City Government - Sustainability Plans](https://www.cdmx.gob.mx/).
