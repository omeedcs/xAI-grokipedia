## Historical Background

### Founding and Early Years
Sony was founded on May 7, 1946, by Masaru Ibuka and Akio Morita in post-World War II Japan under the name Tokyo Tsushin Kogyo (Tokyo Telecommunications Engineering Corporation). Initially, the company focused on repairing radios and producing shortwave converters. In 1950, it released Japan's first tape recorder, the Type-G, marking its entry into innovative consumer electronics [Sony History Timeline](https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/CorporateInfo/history/timeline/).

The name "Sony" was adopted in 1958, derived from the Latin word *sonus* (sound) and the English term "sonny," reflecting the company’s youthful energy and focus on audio technology. The rebranding coincided with its expansion into international markets, particularly the United States [Sony Name Origin](https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/CorporateInfo/history/name/).
