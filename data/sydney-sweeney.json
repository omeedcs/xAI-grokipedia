  "content": "# Sydney Sweeney\n\nSydney Bernice Sweeney (born September 12, 1997) is an American actress and producer noted for her portrayals of complex young women in prestige television, particularly Cassie Howard in the HBO series *Euphoria* (2019–present) and Olivia Mossbacher in the anthology series *The White Lotus* (2021), roles that earned her two Primetime Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series and Limited or Anthology Series, respectively. Born in Spokane, Washington, she relocated to Los Angeles at age 13 to pursue acting, accumulating credits in series such as *Everything Sucks!* (2018) and *The Handmaid's Tale* (2018) before her breakthroughs. Sweeney has expanded into film with leading roles in the romantic comedy *Anyone But You* (2023), which grossed over $220 million worldwide, and the horror thriller *Immaculate* (2024), which she produced via her company Fifty-Fifty Films, demonstrating her transition from supporting television parts to commercial and creative autonomy in features. Her career has intersected with public scrutiny, including industry producer critiques questioning her acting proficiency and attractiveness despite box-office success, as well as backlash over personal events like a family gathering featuring memorabilia linked to political conservatism and marketing campaigns accused of commodifying her image. Sweeney has voiced disillusionment with Hollywood's professed support for women, describing it as performative amid observed competitive dynamics.\n\n## Early life\n### Family and upbringing\n\nSydney Bernice Sweeney was born on September 12, 1997, in Spokane, Washington. She is the daughter of Steven Sweeney, a hospitality worker, and Lisa Sweeney, a former criminal defense attorney who left her profession to raise her children. Sweeney has a younger brother, Trent Sweeney, who attended Gonzaga University before enlisting in the United States Air Force. After her birth, the family relocated to a rural area near the Washington-Idaho border, where she was raised. She lived on the South Hill for much of her childhood and attended Saint George's private school in north Spokane through much of middle school. From ages 12 to 19, she trained and competed in grappling and kickboxing. During high school, she participated in the robotics team, mathematics club, and soccer team. In 2013, when she was 16, her parents had to sell their home in Washington. By 2016 Sweeney’s parents had filed for bankruptcy and divorce. Sweeney graduated as valedictorian of her class from Brighton Hall School in Burbank, California.\n### Entry into acting\n\nSweeney first demonstrated a serious commitment to acting at age 12, when she compiled a five-year business plan in a PowerPoint presentation to persuade her parents to support her professional ambitions in the field. This document outlined specific steps, including acting classes, local auditions, and relocation for broader opportunities, reflecting her strategic approach amid familial financial constraints.\n\nPrior to any full-time relocation, she secured her screen debut in the independent horror-comedy film *ZMD: Zombies of Mass Destruction*, filmed in Washington state and released in 2010, where she appeared at age 11. Her family initially facilitated early opportunities through long-distance efforts, such as 20-hour drives from Spokane to Los Angeles for auditions, allowing her to build initial credits like a guest appearance on the television series *Heroes* in 2009.\n\nTo access more consistent professional prospects, Sweeney's family moved from Spokane, Washington, to Los Angeles in 2010, when she was 13. This relocation enabled regular attendance at casting calls and classes, marking her transition from sporadic regional work to the competitive Hollywood ecosystem, though early years involved financial hardship and limited roles. Subsequent guest spots on shows like *Criminal Minds* (2009) and *90210* (2010) followed, providing foundational experience in television.\n\n## Career\n\n### Early roles (2009–2018)\n\nSweeney began her acting career with guest appearances on established television series. In 2009, she debuted on *Heroes* as Annie March in the episode \"1961\". Later that year, she appeared on *Criminal Minds* as Beth Sherman in the episode \"The Big Wheel\". These early roles were minor, consisting of brief scenes that showcased her as a young supporting character.\n\nIn 2010, Sweeney secured additional television guest spots, including three episodes of *90210* as Girl, a troubled teen, and a high school student on *Pretty Little Liars*. She made her feature film debut that year in the low-budget horror comedy *ZMD: Zombies of Mass Destruction*, portraying Lisa, a character transformed into a zombie amid a viral outbreak on a fictional island. The film, directed by John Hyams, received limited release and critical attention primarily for its satirical take on post-9/11 themes rather than production values.\n\nSweeney's mid-2010s work included sporadic television cameos and independent films. In 2014, she played surgical intern Erin Weaver on *Grey's Anatomy* in season 11, episode 6, \"Don't Let's Start\", appearing in a single scene involving a patient's family. Film credits during this period encompassed *Spiders* (2013) as Emily, a role in a creature-feature about giant arachnids; *The Martial Arts Kid* (2015) as Julia; and *Stolen from Suburbia* (2015) as Emma Hudson, typically in supporting capacities within direct-to-video or festival-level projects.\n\nFrom 2017 to 2018, her opportunities shifted toward more substantial television parts. She portrayed Haley Caren in the web series *In the Vault* (2017). In *The Handmaid's Tale* season 2 (2018), Sweeney played Eden Spencer, a young wife in the dystopian regime who faces execution for perceived adultery. She landed lead roles in *Everything Sucks!* (Netflix, 2018) as Emaline Addario, a rebellious high schooler in a 1990s coming-of-age story, and as Alice in flashbacks for the HBO miniseries *Sharp Objects* (2018). Film work included *Along Came the Devil* (2018) as Ashley, a possessed teen, and a minor part in *Under the Silver Lake* (2018). These roles marked a transition from bit parts to characters with narrative arcs, though still within ensemble or limited-series formats.\n### Breakthrough and establishment (2019–2022)\n\nSweeney's breakthrough occurred in 2019 with her role as Cassie Howard in HBO's *Euphoria*, which premiered on June 16, 2019. In the series, she portrayed a high school student facing challenges in relationships amid rumors regarding her sexual history. The performance garnered attention for its depiction of vulnerability and emotional complexity, marking a shift from supporting roles to more central characters. That same year, she appeared in Quentin Tarantino's *Once Upon a Time in Hollywood*, released on July 26, 2019, playing Snake, a member of the Manson Family in a brief but notable scene.\n\nIn 2020, Sweeney starred as Juliet in the supernatural horror film *Nocturne*, directed by Zu Quirke and released on Amazon Prime Video on October 13, 2020. The role involved a competitive pianist descending into obsession after acquiring a mysterious notebook, earning praise for her portrayal of psychological unraveling. This led into 2021 projects, including a supporting role as Olivia Mossbacher in the first season of HBO's anthology series *The White Lotus*, which premiered on July 11, 2021. She also took a lead role as Pippa in the erotic thriller *The Voyeurs*, directed by Michael Mohan and released on Amazon Prime Video on September 10, 2021, where her character becomes entangled in voyeurism and obsession with neighbors' lives.\n\nThe second season of *Euphoria* aired starting January 9, 2022, further solidifying her status with intensified storylines for Cassie Howard. Sweeney's performance earned her first Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series, announced on July 12, 2022. This period transitioned her from emerging talent to established actress, with leading roles in streaming thrillers and critical television acclaim.\n\n### Recent developments (2023–present)\n\nSweeney achieved a major commercial milestone in 2023 with the romantic comedy *Anyone But You*, directed by Will Gluck, in which she starred as Bea alongside Glen Powell's Ben; the film, produced on a $25 million budget, grossed $220.3 million worldwide, revitalizing interest in the genre through word-of-mouth and social media buzz.) In the same year, she appeared in the biographical drama *Reality*, portraying a supporting role in the dramatization of Reality Winner's interrogation.\n\nTransitioning to diverse genres in 2024, Sweeney took on the role of Julia Cornwall, a precursor to Spider-Woman, in Sony's superhero film *Madame Web*, directed by S. J. Clarkson; despite a reported production budget of $80–100 million, it earned only $100.5 million globally, resulting in substantial financial losses for the studio after marketing costs.) Later that year, she produced and led the cast of the religious horror film *Immaculate* as Cecilia, a novice nun facing supernatural pregnancy; made on a budget under $10 million, it opened to $5.3 million domestically—Neon's strongest debut for an original horror—and ultimately grossed approximately $35 million worldwide, yielding profitability.))\n\nIn 2025, Sweeney's thriller *Americana*, where she played Penny Jo Poplin, debuted to $500,000 domestically across 1,123 theaters, failing to recoup its costs and marking an early-year disappointment amid competition from established franchises. Her survival horror *Eden*, co-starring with Ana de Armas, similarly underperformed, contributing to back-to-back box office setbacks following the prior successes. These releases highlighted Sweeney's expansion into producing and genre experimentation, though with variable commercial outcomes influenced by market saturation and release timing.\n\n#### Major projects\nBeyond theatrical releases, Sweeney reprised her role as Cassie Howard in the third season of HBO's *Euphoria*, with production delayed by strikes and scheduling, commencing in early 2025 and anticipated premiere in 2026. She also featured in the music video for The Rolling Stones' \"Angry\" in 2023, directed by Lana Wilson. Upcoming commitments include leading adaptations such as *The Housemaid* thriller, the Christy Martin boxing biopic emphasizing physical transformation, and a reboot of *Barbarella*, signaling continued genre versatility.\n#### Box office performance\nSweeney's post-2022 projects exhibited stark contrasts: *Anyone But You* exceeded expectations with a sevenfold return on investment, driven by audience appeal over critical reception (53% on Rotten Tomatoes). In contrast, *Madame Web* bombed relative to its scale, underperforming due to poor reviews (10% critics score) and audience fatigue with Sony's Spider-Man Universe spin-offs. *Immaculate* succeeded modestly in the horror niche, benefiting from low costs and targeted marketing, while 2025's *Americana* and *Eden* faltered with minimal openings, attributed to limited appeal and suboptimal release strategies amid blockbuster dominance. Overall, her draw has proven strongest in mid-budget, audience-driven fare rather than high-stakes franchises.\n\n#### Major projects\n\nSweeney co-starred with Glen Powell in the romantic comedy *Anyone But You* (2023), directed by Will Gluck and loosely based on Shakespeare's *Much Ado About Nothing*. The film earned $220.3 million worldwide against a $25 million production budget, achieving profitability through strong word-of-mouth and a late holiday surge that extended its theatrical run.\n\nIn 2024, she took a supporting role as Julia Cornwall in *Madame Web*, a Sony Pictures superhero film directed by S.J. Clarkson, centered on a precognitive paramedic entering the Spider-Man universe. Despite a marketing push, it grossed about $100 million globally on an $80–100 million budget, marking a box-office disappointment attributed to poor reviews and audience reception.\n\nSweeney produced and starred as the lead in *Immaculate* (2024), a horror film directed by Michael Mohan about an American nun encountering horrors in an Italian convent. Released by Neon, it debuted with $5.4 million domestically and totaled around $21 million worldwide, setting a record for the distributor's highest opening but yielding modest returns relative to expectations for the genre.\n\nHer 2025 releases included *Eden*, a sci-fi thriller directed by Ron Howard in which she played a supporting role amid a cast featuring Jude Law and Ana de Armas; the film opened to $1 million domestically across 664 theaters and grossed $2.7 million worldwide, underperforming against its estimated $35 million net financing.\n\n*Americana* (2025), a Lionsgate drama directed by David M. Rosenthal with Sweeney in a lead role exploring a troubled family's dynamics, debuted with under $500,000 from 1,000 U.S. theaters. Though initial reports highlighted the weak opening, the low-budget indie ($9 million estimated) secured global rights for $3 million backed by pre-sales, positioning it for ancillary profitability despite limited theatrical earnings.\n\n#### Box office performance\n\nSweeney's starring role in the 2023 romantic comedy *Anyone But You*, opposite Glen Powell, achieved substantial commercial success, grossing $88.3 million domestically and $220.3 million worldwide against a reported production budget of $25 million. The film's performance, which exceeded expectations for the genre following a period of underperformance for romantic comedies, was attributed to strong word-of-mouth, viral marketing, and extended theatrical legs, ultimately ranking it among the highest-grossing R-rated rom-coms of recent years.\n\nIn 2024, *Immaculate*, a horror film in which Sweeney both starred and served as a producer, opened domestically to $5.36 million from 2,354 theaters, marking Neon's largest opening weekend to date for an original horror title. The film ultimately earned approximately $15.7 million in the United States, with additional international revenue contributing to a modest worldwide total suitable for its low-to-mid budget scale typical of independent horror releases. Its performance reflected solid returns relative to production costs but limited broader appeal compared to mainstream genre entries.\n\nConversely, Sweeney's supporting role in the Sony Marvel film *Madame Web* (2024) underperformed significantly, generating $43.8 million domestically and $100.5 million worldwide against an $80–100 million budget, resulting in a box office loss after marketing expenses. The film's weak reception, compounded by critical panning and audience disinterest, highlighted challenges within the Sony Spider-Man Universe spin-off slate.\n\nHer lead in the 2025 thriller *Americana* fared poorly, opening to an estimated $500,000–$850,000 domestically across 1,100–1,123 theaters and failing to crack the top 20 charts, with total earnings hovering around $10 million amid limited tracking visibility.\n\n| Film              | Release Year | Budget (est.) | Domestic Gross | Worldwide Gross |\n|-------------------|--------------|---------------|----------------|-----------------|\n| *Anyone But You* | 2023        | $25 million  | $88.3 million | $220.3 million  |\n| *Immaculate*     | 2024        | Low-mid      | $15.7 million | ~$25 million    |\n| *Madame Web*     | 2024        | $80–100 million | $43.8 million | $100.5 million  |\n| *Americana*      | 2025        | N/A          | ~$10 million  | N/A             |\n\n### Upcoming projects\n\nSweeney stars as boxer Christy Martin in the biographical drama *Christy*, directed by David Michôd, which chronicles Martin's rise to prominence in the 1990s amid personal and professional challenges, including an abusive marriage. The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2025 and is scheduled for wide theatrical release on November 7, 2025, distributed by Black Bear Pictures. \n\nIn *The Housemaid*, an adaptation of Freida McFadden's thriller novel, Sweeney portrays Millie, a young woman hired as a housemaid for a wealthy family who discovers unsettling secrets about her employers. Co-starring Amanda Seyfried as the family's matriarch Nina, the Lionsgate production is set for theatrical release on December 19, 2025. \n\nSweeney will reprise her role as Cassie Howard in the third season of HBO's *Euphoria*, anticipated for a spring 2026 premiere following a multi-year production delay. The season incorporates a time jump, exploring the characters' post-high school lives, with filming underway since early 2025. \n\nOther projects in various stages of development include a live-action adaptation of *Barbarella*, where Sweeney is attached to star, though no release date has been confirmed, and an untitled Gundam film in pre-production.\n\n## Business ventures and endorsements\n\n### Key partnerships\n\nSydney Sweeney established a prominent partnership with American Eagle Outfitters in July 2025, launching the \"Sydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans\" campaign to promote the brand's denim line targeted at Generation Z consumers. The initiative featured Sweeney in advertisements emphasizing comfort and fit, resulting in record-breaking sales for the retailer, with the associated collection selling out rapidly and contributing to a significant surge in American Eagle's stock price.\n\nIn the beauty sector, Sweeney serves as the first global brand ambassador for Laneige, a Korean skincare company, with the partnership announced in January 2024 and subsequently expanded. She has featured in campaigns for products like the Water Bank Collection and Bouncy \\u0026 Firm serum, and collaborated on limited-edition items such as the Rainbow Sherbet Lip Sleeping Mask, co-developed with Baskin-Robbins in July 2025, drawing from her personal affinity for the ice cream flavor.\n\nAdditional key collaborations include endorsements with luxury fashion house Miu Miu, appearing in their campaigns since 2022, and beauty brands Armani Beauty and Kérastase for haircare promotions. She has also partnered with lifestyle brands like Hey Dude shoes and Parade lingerie, expanding her portfolio across apparel, cosmetics, and consumer goods. These deals have collectively bolstered her commercial influence, with reports estimating her endorsement empire at $40 million by mid-2025.\n\n### Impact on career\n\nSweeney's endorsement deals, including high-profile partnerships with brands such as American Eagle, Miu Miu, Armani Beauty, and Laneige, have substantially diversified her income streams beyond acting, contributing an estimated $7.5 million annually to her finances as of 2025. These ventures have elevated her net worth to approximately $40 million, providing financial independence that enables selective project choices and reduces reliance on traditional Hollywood roles. \n\nThe 2025 American Eagle \"Great Jeans\" campaign, featuring Sweeney prominently, generated over 40 billion impressions and drove a surge in sales, with signature jeans selling out within a week and adding more than 700,000 new customers to the brand.  This commercial success enhanced her marketability, correlating with higher acting paychecks, such as a reported $7.5 million for an upcoming role, positioning her among top-earning actresses in her age group. Despite backlash over the ad's phrasing, which sparked partisan divides and temporary foot traffic dips, the overall exposure reinforced her brand resilience without derailing professional momentum. \n\nEarlier collaborations, like the 2022 Miu Miu bag campaign, capitalized on her rising visibility from *Euphoria* and *The White Lotus*, fostering \"super high visibility\" in luxury fashion circles and opening doors to additional endorsements with Samsung and Kérastase. These partnerships have strategically amplified her public persona, blending entertainment with commercial appeal to sustain career longevity amid Hollywood's volatility. Sweeney has actively managed these decisions independently, leveraging her 20 million Instagram followers to negotiate deals that align with her image, further solidifying her transition from breakout star to multifaceted entrepreneur. \n\n## Public image and controversies\n\n### Media portrayal and cultural impact\n\nMedia coverage of Sydney Sweeney frequently emphasizes her physical appearance, often framing her as a symbol of conventional feminine beauty, which has led to both admiration and criticism. In roles such as Cassie Howard in *Euphoria*, her nude scenes drew significant attention, contributing to discussions on objectification in entertainment. During her *Saturday Night Live* hosting debut on March 2, 2024, Sweeney addressed online rumors about her attractiveness and alleged affairs, joking about expectations tied to her looks, which some production staff found risky but she embraced for its self-aware humor. This portrayal has positioned her as a counterpoint to industry norms, with Sweeney herself critiquing Hollywood's insincere \"women empowering other women\" rhetoric in a November 2024 *Vanity Fair* interview, stating it is \"fake\" and that female colleagues have undermined her career prospects due to jealousy over her success and appearance.\n\nSweeney's cultural impact manifests in broader debates over beauty standards, feminism, and political polarization, particularly evident in the backlash to her July 2025 American Eagle Outfitters campaign featuring the tagline \"Sydney Sweeney has great jeans,\" a pun on \"great genes\" that some outlets linked to eugenics and white supremacy due to her blonde, blue-eyed image. Initial criticism was limited, but right-wing commentators amplified it as evidence of \"woke\" overreach against traditional attractiveness, boosting the ad's visibility and sales while highlighting divisions in cultural discourse. This episode, alongside her public rejections of performative feminism—such as calling out attacks from self-proclaimed feminists—has cast her as a flashpoint in backlash against progressive beauty mandates, with supporters viewing her unapologetic femininity as empowering and detractors as regressive. Her comments on industry hypocrisy, including producers advising her to suppress her sex appeal, underscore causal tensions between market-driven appeal and ideological conformity in Hollywood. Overall, Sweeney's prominence reflects empirical resistance to homogenized narratives, evidenced by heightened engagement metrics during controversies that favor authentic representation over curated equity.\n\n### Specific controversies\n\n![American Eagle \"Sydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans\" advertisement campaign in-store.jpg][float-right]\n\nIn August 2022, photos surfaced from Sydney Sweeney's mother's 60th birthday party, showing guests wearing \"Make Sixty Great Again\" hats, a parody of the \"Make America Great Again\" slogan associated with Donald Trump. The images, posted by Sweeney's brother, prompted backlash on social media accusing the family of political affiliation with Trump supporters, despite the themed nature of the event. Sweeney addressed the controversy in August 2023, stating there were \"many misinterpretations\" and clarifying it was not an endorsement of political views.\n\nIn December 2023, Sweeney appeared in The Rolling Stones' music video for \"Angry,\" wearing a revealing outfit that drew criticism from some outlets and commentators for objectifying her. Sweeney rejected these claims in interviews, emphasizing she selected the outfit herself and felt empowered, stating, \"I felt hot.\"\n\nIn November 2024, Sweeney described Hollywood's narrative of \"women empowering other women\" as \"fake\" in a Vanity Fair interview, citing personal experiences of exclusion and competition among female executives and producers. The remarks elicited backlash from some industry figures and media, who viewed them as undermining feminist solidarity in the entertainment sector, though supporters argued they reflected observable competitive dynamics.\n\nIn May 2025, Sweeney collaborated with Dr. Squatch on a limited-edition soap bar infused with her bathwater, marketed with sensual imagery that sparked online criticism labeling it a gimmick and accusing it of promoting objectification. Sweeney defended the product in August 2025, noting that backlash primarily came from women, while male consumers embraced similar novelty items tied to her co-stars, such as Jacob Elordi's bathwater candle.\n\nThe most prominent controversy arose in July-August 2025 from Sweeney's American Eagle Outfitters campaign featuring the slogan \"Sydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans,\" a pun on \"genes\" highlighting her physique in form-fitting denim. Progressive commentators and outlets, including NPR and The Guardian, criticized the ads for hypersexualization, promoting eugenics through genetic superiority implications, and reinforcing white beauty standards amid declining DEI initiatives. The backlash intensified after public records revealed Sweeney's Republican voter registration in Florida on June 14, 2024, prompting accusations of alignment with conservative politics; former President Trump publicly praised her amid the uproar. Defenders, including some conservative voices, dismissed the outrage as exaggerated cultural overreach against traditional femininity. American Eagle's stock rose during the period, unaffected by the criticism.\n\n### Responses and defenses\n\nIn August 2022, Sweeney addressed online backlash over photographs from her mother's 60th birthday celebration, which featured attendees wearing apparel supporting Donald Trump, by posting on Instagram that the event was \"an innocent celebration\" misconstrued as a political statement and urging critics to \"stop making assumptions about me and my family,\" describing the scrutiny as \"truly disrespectful.\" She reiterated this defense in August 2023 amid renewed social media discussion, emphasizing the non-political intent behind family gatherings and rejecting attempts to politicize her personal life.\n\nDuring her March 2024 hosting stint on *Saturday Night Live*, Sweeney incorporated self-deprecating humor in her monologue about the family photos, joking, \"You guys, this is wild,\" while waving to the audience, thereby diffusing criticism through satire rather than evasion. In response to accusations of excessive objectification via body-focused sketches, *SNL* cast member Bowen Yang stated that Sweeney had \"practically begged\" writers to include jokes about her physique, indicating her proactive embrace of such material to reclaim narrative control.\n\nIn November 2024, Sweeney criticized Hollywood's professed culture of female solidarity as \"fake\" in a *Vanity Fair* interview, asserting that \"none of it's happening\" and expressing disappointment at women \"tearing other women down,\" particularly citing instances where established actresses undermined emerging talent like herself. She attributed much online vitriol, including toward her promotional ventures, to female critics who invoke misogyny to deflect substantive disagreement, as evidenced by her August 2025 comments on the backlash to a soap product marketed as scented like her bathwater, where she noted that \"women love to scream misogyny\" while men purchased it enthusiastically, contrasting it with hypothetical enthusiasm for similar items tied to male co-stars like Jacob Elordi.\n\nSweeney's responses have drawn external support, such as comedian Matt Rife's August 2025 defense against criticism of her American Eagle jeans advertisement, where he argued the outrage stemmed from manufactured controversy rather than genuine offense. Similarly, American Eagle CEO Jay Schottenstein in October 2025 rejected fears of backlash as untenable, affirming the campaign's value despite polarized reactions.\n\n## Personal life\n\n### Relationships and engagements\n\nSydney Sweeney began dating businessman and film producer Jonathan Davino in 2018, with the pair first photographed together at a Chicago restaurant that year. They maintained a low public profile throughout their relationship, with Sweeney describing Davino as supportive of her career in a 2022 interview. The couple became engaged in March 2022, after four years together, though Sweeney rarely discussed the relationship publicly to preserve privacy.\n\nSweeney and Davino's engagement ended in March 2025, following seven years as a couple, with reports citing differing priorities amid her rising fame. In a May 2025 interview with *The Times*, Sweeney confirmed the split, stating she was \"single\" and focusing on personal growth, while expressing no bitterness toward Davino. Post-breakup sightings, including Davino with other women in October 2025, underscored the finality of their separation.\n\nFollowing the breakup, Sweeney has been linked to music executive Scooter Braun, with reports of casual dating beginning after they met at Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez's wedding in summer 2025. Earlier rumors during 2023's *Anyone But You* promotion involved co-star Glen Powell, fueled by on-set chemistry and public interactions, but both denied any romance, attributing speculation to promotional strategy. Sweeney has historically prioritized privacy in her personal life, avoiding detailed commentary on romantic entanglements beyond confirmed facts.\n\n### Philanthropy and interests\n\nSweeney has engaged in limited but targeted philanthropic efforts, primarily focused on local community support and mental health initiatives. In December 2020, she donated $12,000 to a Spokane, Washington-based program that funded meals from 12 local restaurants distributed to 12 homeless shelters, leveraging her ties to her hometown. In July 2025, as part of her endorsement partnership with American Eagle Outfitters, she promoted \"The Sydney Jean,\" a limited-edition item where 100% of the purchase price was donated to Crisis Text Line, a nonprofit providing free, 24/7 mental health crisis support via text.\n\nSweeney's personal interests emphasize physical activity and hands-on pursuits. She has described enjoying a range of sports, including soccer, football, skiing, baseball, golf, and water skiing, often sharing related activities on social media.  Additionally, she pursues mechanics as a hobby, restoring vintage cars such as a 1969 Ford Mustang and a Chevrolet truck, which she has documented publicly. Sweeney also practices mixed martial arts for fitness and self-defense, crediting it with building her discipline and physical resilience. Other hobbies include decorating and building projects, reflecting a preference for creative, constructive endeavors.\n\n## Artistic output\n\n### Film roles\n\nSweeney debuted in feature films with minor roles in low-budget productions, including the horror film *Along Came the Devil* (2018), where she played Ashley, a young woman possessed by demonic forces after a traumatic event. That year, she also appeared briefly as a shooting star performer in the neo-noir thriller *Under the Silver Lake*, directed by David Robert Mitchell, featuring Andrew Garfield in the lead.\n\nIn 2019, Sweeney had a supporting role as Snake, one of the female members of Charles Manson's cult, in Quentin Tarantino's *Once Upon a Time in Hollywood*, a film depicting 1960s Hollywood and the Manson murders that earned ten Academy Award nominations. She followed this with a lead role in the psychological horror *Nocturne* (2020), portraying Jules, an introverted pianist who ascends to stardom after her rival's mysterious death, exploring themes of ambition and supernatural influence.\n\nSweeney's first major leading role in a wide-release film came in *The Voyeurs* (2021), an erotic thriller directed by Michael Mohan, where she starred as Pippa, a young woman whose voyeuristic tendencies unravel her relationship and lead to obsession with her neighbors. The film received mixed reviews for its stylistic nods to Hitchcock but was noted for Sweeney's performance in a provocative role.\n\nIn 2023, she portrayed Reality Winner, the former U.S. Air Force translator convicted of leaking classified information, in the biographical drama *Reality*, directed by Tina Satter; the film dramatizes Winner's 2017 FBI interrogation and premiered at the Venice Film Festival. Later that year, Sweeney starred opposite Glen Powell in the romantic comedy *Anyone But You*, a loose adaptation of Shakespeare's *Much Ado About Nothing*, playing Beatrice \"Bea\" Wylder in a story of fake dating at a destination wedding; the film grossed over $220 million worldwide on a $25 million budget, becoming one of the highest-grossing romantic comedies of the decade.\n\nSweeney expanded into horror with *Immaculate* (2024), which she co-produced and starred in as Cecilia, an American nun experiencing a miraculous but sinister pregnancy at an Italian convent; the film opened at number one at the U.S. box office, earning $5.7 million in its debut weekend despite critical mixed reception. In the superhero film *Madame Web* (2024), she played Julia Cornwall, one of three teenagers mentored by the titular clairvoyant, in a Sony Pictures production that faced poor reviews and underperformed commercially.\n\n### Television roles\n\nSweeney began appearing in television with minor guest roles as a teenager, including parts in *Heroes* (2009), *Criminal Minds* (2009), *90210* (2010), *Pretty Little Liars* (2010), and *Grey's Anatomy* (2014). These early appearances, often limited to single episodes, provided initial exposure on established network dramas and procedurals.\n\nIn 2018, she secured recurring roles in higher-profile series, portraying Eden Spencer, a young bride in the Gilead regime, across seven episodes of season 2 of Hulu's *The Handmaid's Tale*. That same year, Sweeney appeared in HBO's limited series *Sharp Objects* as Alice, a self-harming teenage patient sharing a room with the protagonist in a psychiatric facility; she featured in seven episodes, drawing on research into mental health cases for the role. She also starred as Emaline Addario, a drama club member exploring her identity amid 1990s high school dynamics, in all 10 episodes of Netflix's single-season comedy *Everything Sucks!*.\n\nSweeney's performance as Cassie Howard, a vulnerable high schooler grappling with romantic entanglements, body image, and family dysfunction, in HBO's *Euphoria* (2019–present) marked her breakthrough; she has appeared in 16 episodes as a main cast member through season 2, with the series renewed for further seasons as of 2025. The role, which involved explicit depictions of teen sexuality and emotional turmoil, propelled her visibility, though it drew mixed commentary on its intensity for a 21-year-old actress at debut.\n\nIn 2021, she played Olivia Mossbacher, a privileged and sarcastic college student accompanying her family on a Hawaiian resort vacation, in all six episodes of season 1 of HBO's anthology series *The White Lotus*. The satirical portrayal contributed to the show's Emmy wins for limited series, highlighting class tensions and family discord.\n\n### Other media appearances\n\nSweeney appeared in the music video for The Rolling Stones' single \"Angry,\" released on September 6, 2023, portraying a character in the narrative directed by François Rousselet. The video, part of the promotion for the band's album *Hackney Diamonds*, features Sweeney in a leather outfit amid a storyline involving conflict and resolution.\n\nIn 2024, Sweeney hosted an episode of *Saturday Night Live* on March 2, with musical guest Kacey Musgraves, marking her debut as host. During the episode, she performed in sketches such as \"Hooters Waitress,\" where she played a new employee causing disruption among colleagues. Her monologue addressed her career and online perceptions, including a surprise cameo by *Anyone But You* co-star Glen Powell.\n\nSweeney has featured in various commercial advertisements, including American Eagle's \"Sydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans\" campaign launched in July 2025, which promoted denim products through print and video formats. The campaign, emphasizing essential denim styling, generated significant online discussion and contributed to sell-outs of featured jeans styles. iSpot.tv records 17 nationally aired TV ad campaigns involving Sweeney as of recent tracking.\n\n## Recognition\n\n### Awards and nominations\n\nSweeney received her first major industry recognition with two Primetime Emmy Award nominations in 2022 for her performances in *Euphoria* and *The White Lotus*. She was nominated for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series for portraying Cassie Howard in *Euphoria*'s second season. The same year, she earned a nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie for her role as Olivia Mossbacher in *The White Lotus* first season.\n\n| Year | Award | Category | Work | Result |\n|------|--------|----------|------|--------|\n| 2022 | Primetime Emmy Awards | Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series | *Euphoria* | Nominated |\n| 2022 | Primetime Emmy Awards | Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie | *The White Lotus* | Nominated |\n| 2022 | MTV Movie \\u0026 TV Awards | Best Fight | *Euphoria* (Cassie vs. Maddy scene) | Won |\n| 2024 | Critics' Choice Television Awards | Best Actress in a Limited Series or Movie Made for Television | *Reality* | Nominated |\n| 2024 | Gracie Awards | Best Actress in a Leading Role in a Movie Made for TV | *Reality* | Won |\n| 2025 | Hamptons International Film Festival | Achievement in Acting Award | *Christy* | Won |\n\nShe accepted the MTV Movie \\u0026 TV Awards win for Best Fight on behalf of the *Euphoria* cast, highlighting the season's pivotal confrontation scene. Additional nominations include the 2022 People's Choice Award for The Drama TV Star of 2022 for *Euphoria*. Sweeney has not received Golden Globe or Academy Award nominations as of October 2025.\n\n### Critical reception\n\nSydney Sweeney's portrayal of Cassie Howard in *Euphoria* earned widespread acclaim for its emotional intensity and nuance, with critics highlighting her ability to convey vulnerability, desperation, and misguided ambition in a character prone to self-sabotage. Her performance in season two, which garnered an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series, was described as a \"rollercoaster ride\" that captivated audiences through dynamic range, including subtle humor amid chaos. However, some reviewers noted the role's reliance on overt physicality and nudity, which occasionally overshadowed subtler acting choices.\n\nIn *The White Lotus* season one, Sweeney's depiction of the cynical college student Olivia Mossbacher was praised for its \"terrifying\" authenticity, capturing entitled disdain and underlying insecurity in a satire of privilege. Critics commended her for embodying a deeply unlikable yet believable archetype, contributing to the ensemble's sharp social commentary, though the character's abrasiveness drew viewer backlash focused on its realism rather than performative flaws. Her work contrasted with more bombastic roles, showcasing restraint that some outlets called a breakout amid the series' humor.\n\nFilm roles have elicited more divided responses, with dramatic turns faring better than commercial vehicles. In the 2023 biopic *Reality*, Sweeney delivered a \"tour de force\" as whistleblower Reality Winner, earning praise for tense, cornered intensity during a single-take interrogation sequence that highlighted her capacity for sustained dramatic pressure. Similarly, in the 2024 horror film *Immaculate*, she was lauded as \"stellar\" for raw vulnerability and gonzo screams amid themes of bodily autonomy, bolstering the film's 72% Rotten Tomatoes score despite narrative shortcomings.  Critics like those at *The Guardian* appreciated her commitment to the \"nunsploitation\" genre's gore and provocation.\n\nRomantic comedies have drawn sharper scrutiny, as in *Anyone But You* (2023), which holds a 53% Rotten Tomatoes rating and was critiqued as \"slick but soulless\" despite Sweeney's evident charm and chemistry with co-star Glen Powell.  Some reviewers dismissed her efforts as competent amid a \"dreadful\" script, while others argued her physical appeal overshadowed acting critiques, perpetuating a pattern where her attractiveness invites dismissal of talent. Negative assessments, such as Roger Ebert's 1.5/4 for *Immaculate* claiming she \"cannot act\" beyond aesthetics, reflect a subset of commentary questioning her range, often attributing mediocrity to roles emphasizing looks over depth. This tension underscores broader debates, where empirical success in viewer engagement (e.g., *Anyone But You*'s $220 million box office) contrasts with elite critical metrics influenced by genre expectations.",
