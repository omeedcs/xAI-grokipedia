# Pizza

Pizza is a savory dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomato sauce, cheese, and various other ingredients, then baked at a high temperature, often in a wood-fired oven. The traditional Neapolitan form uses a base of dough made from wheat flour, water, yeast, and salt, topped with crushed San Marzano tomatoes, fresh mozzarella cheese, basil, and extra virgin olive oil, achieving a soft, elastic texture with a raised, airy edge known as the cornicione. The modern form of pizza emerged in Naples in the 18th or early 19th century as an affordable street food for the working class, evolving from ancient flatbreads topped with herbs, oils, and other simple ingredients consumed by civilizations including the ancient Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans as far back as 600 B.C. A pivotal moment came in 1889 when Neapolitan pizzaiolo Raffaele Esposito created a pizza with tomatoes, mozzarella, and basil—colors mirroring the Italian flag—for Queen Margherita of Savoy, helping to elevate its status beyond humble origins.

The art of the Neapolitan *pizzaiuolo*—encompassing the manual preparation of dough, topping application, and wood-fired baking— was inscribed in 2017 on UNESCO's Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity, recognizing its role in fostering community gatherings, intergenerational knowledge transmission, and cultural identity in Naples and the Campania region, where around 3,000 practitioners uphold the tradition through family workshops and formal training. Italian immigrants introduced pizza to the United States in the late 19th century, with the first licensed pizzeria, Gennaro Lombardi's in New York City, opening in 1905; by the mid-20th century, especially after World War II, it had exploded in popularity, becoming a cornerstone of American fast food and inspiring countless regional variations. As of 2024, Americans alone consume over 3 billion pizzas each year, underscoring pizza's transformation into a global phenomenon while organizations like the Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana, founded in 1984, continue to certify authentic producers and suppliers worldwide to preserve its Neapolitan roots.

## History

### Etymology

The word "pizza" first appears in historical records in a Latin notarial document dated May 997 AD from Gaeta, a town in southern Italy then part of the Byzantine Empire, where it denotes a form of bread used as tribute payment. The text records that Bernardo, son of Duke Marino II and an unconsecrated bishop of Gaeta, leased a mill and promised to provide the local bishop with "duodecim pizze" (twelve pizzas), along with other items like a pig's shoulder at Christmas and two chickens at Easter. This marks the earliest known written use of the term, predating its association with Naples by centuries and suggesting the word entered Latin from emerging Romance dialects in central-southern Italy.

The etymology of "pizza" traces back to Latin roots, specifically the verb *pinsere* ("to pound," "to stamp," or "to flatten"), which evolved through Vulgar Latin into dialectal forms in medieval Italy. According to etymological analyses, it likely passed via Old Italian *pinza* ("clamp" or "vice"), referring to the pinching or clamping action in dough preparation, or *pizzicare* ("to pinch," "to pluck," or "to pick"), evoking the quick plucking of the baked flatbread from the oven or the pinching of its edges. An early variant, "picea," appears in 10th-century texts and may relate to the charring or blackening of the crust during baking, though this form is less directly attested. These derivations highlight the term's connection to the manual labor of flattening and shaping simple breads.

Influences from ancient Greek are also proposed, with "pizza" potentially linked to *pitta* (or *pikte*), a Byzantine Greek term for a fermented or bran-based flatbread, introduced to southern Italy through Greek colonization and later Byzantine rule. In regional dialects, such as Neapolitan, the word manifested as "piza," reflecting phonetic shifts in southern Italian vernaculars. By the 16th to 18th centuries in Naples, "pizza" had standardized to describe modest, topped flatbreads hawked by street vendors (known as *pizzaiuoli*) to laborers and the urban poor, transforming from a generic bread term into a specific culinary concept tied to quick, affordable meals. This evolution underscores the word's adaptation within Italy's multicultural linguistic landscape, blending Latin, Greek, and Germanic elements like the Lombard *bizzo* ("bite" or "morsel").

### Early History

The origins of pizza-like foods trace back to ancient civilizations where flatbreads served as a staple, often topped with simple ingredients for flavor and nutrition. Archaeological evidence indicates that ancient Egyptians baked flatbreads resembling focaccia as early as circa 6000 BCE, using emmer wheat and barley flours mixed with water and baked on hot stones or in rudimentary ovens; these unleavened discs were sometimes enhanced with oils or seeds, forming a basic precursor to topped breads. Greek and Roman culinary traditions further developed these concepts, with references to layered flatbreads appearing in classical literature. The Roman dish known as *placenta*, a layered pastry with cheese and honey mentioned in Virgil's *Aeneid* (1st century BCE) as a ritual offering, was baked into a cake-like form that echoed modern stratified pizzas; this treat was offered in religious rituals and feasts, highlighting its cultural significance. By the medieval period in Italy, particularly around Naples from the 6th century onward, tomatoes from the Americas had not yet arrived—introduced only in the 1540s via Spanish explorers—leaving local flatbreads topped instead with olive oil, herbs such as oregano and basil, and garlic to create flavorful, affordable meals for laborers and peasants.

Documentation of these pre-tomato flatbreads proliferated in the 16th century, as seen in the comprehensive cookbook *Opera* by Bartolomeo Scappi, published in 1570. As chef to Popes Pius IV and Pius V, Scappi included several recipes for "pizza"—round, flaky pastries topped with ingredients like fruits, nuts, cheeses, and herbs, baked in wood-fired ovens; these Neapolitan-style preparations, such as a version with rose water and sugar, bridged ancient flatbread traditions with emerging Renaissance techniques, emphasizing layered dough and regional flavors.

### Modern History

In the 19th century, pizza evolved from a staple street food in Naples to a symbol of Italian culinary identity, particularly through the creation of the Margherita pizza in 1889 by pizzaiolo Raffaele Esposito of Pizzeria Brandi. Commissioned to honor Queen Margherita of Savoy during her visit to Naples, Esposito crafted three varieties, with the Margherita—topped with tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, and fresh basil to represent the colors of the Italian flag—becoming the most celebrated and establishing the classic toppings that define Neapolitan pizza today.

The late 19th and early 20th centuries saw Italian immigrants introduce pizza to the Americas, particularly the United States, where waves of Neapolitan migrants settled in urban centers like New York City starting in the 1880s. These immigrants adapted their traditional recipes to local ingredients and ovens, turning pizza from a working-class meal into a burgeoning ethnic cuisine. The first licensed pizzeria in the U.S., Lombardi's in Manhattan's Little Italy, opened in 1905 under Italian immigrant Gennaro Lombardi, who used coal-fired ovens to bake pies that popularized the thin-crust New York-style among diverse communities.

Commercialization accelerated in the mid-20th century, transforming pizza into a mass-market industry. In the 1950s, brothers Domenick and Giuseppe Celentano, owners of a New Haven, Connecticut, pizzeria, pioneered frozen pizza by experimenting with par-baked crusts to preserve quality after freezing, leading to the first commercially available frozen pizzas in 1957 and national distribution by 1957. This innovation made pizza accessible beyond urban immigrant enclaves. The sector boomed with chain establishments, including Pizza Hut, founded in 1958 by brothers Dan and Frank Carney in Wichita, Kansas, with a $600 loan, which grew into a global franchise emphasizing family dining, and Domino's Pizza, established in 1960 by Thomas Monaghan in Ypsilanti, Michigan, focusing on rapid delivery to capture suburban demand.

Entering the 21st century, pizza's global reach expanded amid renewed appreciation for artisanal traditions and sustained chain growth. In 2017, UNESCO inscribed the "Art of Neapolitan 'Pizzaiuolo'"—encompassing the dough preparation, topping, and wood-fired baking techniques—on its Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity, recognizing its cultural significance and prompting worldwide efforts to preserve authentic methods. By 2025, the global pizza market had reached approximately $283 billion, driven by chain expansions like Domino's and Pizza Hut adding over 1,000 locations annually in emerging markets such as Asia-Pacific, alongside a surge in artisanal pizzerias emphasizing premium, locally sourced ingredients in response to consumer demand for gourmet experiences.

## Preparation

### Dough and Crust

The foundation of pizza lies in its dough, a simple mixture primarily composed of flour, water, yeast, and salt. Traditional recipes call for tipo 00 flour, a finely milled Italian wheat flour with low protein content (around 9-12%), or bread flour with higher protein (12-14%) for better structure and chewiness. Water typically comprises 60-70% of the flour weight for hydration, enabling the dough to develop elasticity without becoming too sticky. Yeast, either active dry or instant, initiates fermentation by converting sugars into carbon dioxide and alcohol, while salt enhances flavor and strengthens the gluten network. A basic recipe for one large pizza might include 500 grams of flour, 325 grams of water, 10 grams of salt, and 3-5 grams of yeast, mixed until a shaggy dough forms.

Kneading the dough, either by hand for 8-10 minutes or with a stand mixer for 5-7 minutes, develops the gluten proteins in the flour, creating a smooth, elastic ball that can be stretched thinly without tearing. After kneading, the dough undergoes rising, or bulk fermentation, where it doubles in size over 1-2 hours at room temperature for quick preparation or up to 24 hours in the refrigerator for enhanced flavor. This extended cold fermentation allows slower activity, resulting in a more complex taste profile and improved extensibility. Par-baking techniques, such as pre-baking the shaped dough at 450-500°F for 5-7 minutes, are sometimes used to set the structure before adding toppings, particularly for thicker crusts to avoid sogginess.

Fermentation science underscores the transformative role of yeast and bacteria in dough quality. Yeast ferments starches into gases that aerate the dough, while simultaneously promoting gluten development through enzymatic action that breaks down proteins for better network formation. In longer ferments, naturally occurring lactic acid bacteria in the flour produce lactic and acetic acids, contributing tangy flavors and tenderizing the crumb without excessive sourness. This process, akin to that in sourdough but yeast-driven here, peaks around 24 hours, yielding a crust with balanced chew and subtle nuttiness.

Pizza crusts vary by hydration and baking method, influencing texture from crisp to chewy. Thin crusts, like those in Neapolitan style, use high hydration dough (\u003e60% water to flour ratio) for a light, airy interior with blistered edges, stretched by hand to about 1/8-inch thickness. Thicker crusts, such as Sicilian, employ lower hydration (around 50-60%) and are pan-baked in oiled trays for a golden, focaccia-like exterior with soft, pillowy centers. These differences arise from flour absorption and fermentation duration, with high-hydration doughs requiring skilled handling to prevent tearing.

Common flours for pizza dough are wheat-based, with tipo 00 prized for its fine grind that yields tender results, and bread flour favored for its strength in handling higher hydration. Substitutions include ancient grains like spelt, which offers a nutty flavor and similar gluten-forming proteins but lower elasticity, often blended 50/50 with wheat flour to maintain structure. Spelt's whole grain nature increases fiber and nutrients but may require adjusted hydration due to higher absorption. These alternatives suit dietary preferences while preserving core dough functionality.

### Sauce and Toppings

The tomato sauce serves as the foundational layer for most pizzas, providing a balance of acidity and sweetness that enhances the overall flavor profile. Originating in the Campania region of Italy, the sauce traditionally features San Marzano tomatoes, a variety prized for their low acidity, thick flesh, and inherent sweetness due to the volcanic soil near Mount Vesuvius. These plum-shaped tomatoes, first cultivated in the early 19th century and gaining prominence in pizza preparation by the 1800s, are typically peeled and crushed by hand without pre-cooking in authentic Neapolitan styles, allowing their fresh flavors to develop during baking. In contrast, many broader Italian and Italian-American preparations simmer the sauce with garlic, oregano, and basil to deepen umami and herbal notes, achieving a harmonious acidity-sweetness ratio that complements the dough and cheese.

According to the regulations of the Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana (AVPN), for Margherita pizza the uncooked variant uses 60-80 grams of peeled San Marzano tomatoes from Agro Sarnese-Nocerino D.O.P., or 0-100 grams for Marinara, seasoned minimally with salt, extra virgin olive oil, and optional fresh basil leaves added post-baking to preserve aroma; garlic and oregano appear in specific types like Marinara but remain uncooked prior to oven exposure. This approach ensures the sauce's bright, tangy profile without overpowering the simple ingredients. The balance of acidity from the tomatoes' natural citric content and sweetness from their varietal traits prevents the sauce from dominating, allowing toppings to integrate seamlessly.

Common toppings build upon the sauce to add texture, protein, and variety, with vegetables such as mushrooms and bell peppers providing earthy or crisp elements that offset the sauce's tang. Meats like Italian sausage or anchovies contribute savory depth, with anchovies offering a salty, umami punch that pairs well with the sauce's acidity. These selections emphasize quality and moderation, drawing from traditional Italian influences where fresh, seasonal produce and cured proteins enhance rather than overwhelm the base.

Layering principles are crucial for even cooking and structural integrity, starting with a thin application of sauce (typically 60-80 grams for a 12-inch pizza) directly on the dough to avoid sogginess from excess moisture. Cheese follows as the next layer to create a barrier that melts and binds, with heavier toppings like meats or vegetables distributed last in controlled portions—about 20-50 grams total—to ensure uniform heat penetration and prevent uneven baking or crust saturation. This method, rooted in professional baking techniques, promotes crispness while allowing cheese's melting properties to secure toppings effectively.

Allergen considerations influence topping and sauce choices, with most traditional tomato-based pizzas inherently nut-free due to simple ingredient lists excluding tree nuts or peanuts. For those with shellfish sensitivities, nut-free seafood options like clams feature in white pizzas, which omit tomato sauce entirely and use olive oil or garlic bases to highlight briny flavors without cross-contamination risks when prepared separately. Pizzerias often segregate allergens like nuts or shellfish in storage and preparation to maintain safety.

### Cheese and Baking

In traditional pizza preparation, mozzarella serves as the primary cheese, with varieties such as fior di latte—made from cow's milk—and buffalo mozzarella prized for their fresh, creamy melt that integrates seamlessly with other toppings. Provolone, often smoked for added depth, complements mozzarella in certain regional styles, providing a sharper tang and firmer texture when melted. To achieve optimal melt, fresh mozzarella is typically torn or cut into chunks rather than shredded, allowing it to release moisture gradually during baking and form a cohesive, stretchy layer without excessive pooling. Shredding is more common with low-moisture mozzarella, which is prepped by grating to ensure even distribution and quicker fusion under heat, reducing the risk of sogginess.

Baking pizza finalizes its texture and flavor through intense, rapid heat application, traditionally in wood-fired ovens reaching 800–900°F (430–480°C), where the pie cooks in 60–90 seconds to yield a charred exterior and soft interior. This high-temperature method, rooted in Neapolitan practice, promotes quick rising of the dough while simultaneously melting the cheese into bubbly pools. In home settings, adaptations involve preheating conventional ovens to their maximum, around 500°F (260°C), often using a pizza stone or steel for 8–12 minutes of bake time to mimic the char and crispness.

The Maillard reaction, triggered by these elevated temperatures above 280°F (140°C), drives the desirable browning of the crust and cheese, where amino acids and sugars react to produce complex, nutty flavors and appealing visual cues. On the crust, this manifests as "leopard spotting"—distinct charred bubbles from gas pockets in the dough caramelizing unevenly under radiant heat—enhancing both taste and texture. Similarly, the cheese develops golden bubbles as its proteins denature and surface sugars brown, contributing to the iconic glossy, blistered appearance without overcooking the base.

Post-baking, pizzas require a brief resting period of 2–5 minutes on a wire rack to allow steam to escape and the structure to set, preventing a soggy cut while preserving crispness. Cutting follows with a specialized pizza wheel, a rotating blade tool that slices cleanly through the set cheese and crust without tearing, ensuring even portions.

## Varieties and Styles

### Topping Varieties

Pizza toppings play a crucial role in defining the flavor profiles and cultural identities of various pizza styles, with combinations evolving from simple, traditional ingredients to more diverse and inventive assortments. Classic options emphasize balance between acidity, creaminess, and freshness, while popular variants in different regions highlight bold spices or contrasting textures. Among the most iconic are those that have become staples worldwide, each with distinct origins and characteristics.

The **Margherita** pizza features a simple yet elegant combination of tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella cheese, and basil leaves, representing the colors of the Italian flag—red, white, and green. This topping set originated in 1889 when Neapolitan pizzaiolo Raffaele Esposito created it at the request of Queen Margherita of Savoy during her visit to Naples, aiming to showcase local ingredients in a dish fit for royalty. The combination's minimalism allows the high-quality, fresh elements to shine, making it a benchmark for authentic Neapolitan pizza.

**Pepperoni** toppings consist of thin slices of spicy, cured salami that curl and crisp during baking, adding a smoky, peppery heat to the pizza. Developed by Italian immigrants in New York City in the early 1900s as an American adaptation of Italian salumi, pepperoni became widely available due to efficient production methods like lactic acid fermentation and shortened curing times. It emerged as the dominant pizza topping in the United States by the mid-20th century, appearing on over a third of all pizzas sold there, thanks to its bold flavor and compatibility with frozen pizza logistics in the 1950s and 1960s.

The **Hawaiian** pizza pairs sweet pineapple chunks with savory ham slices, creating a controversial sweet-and-savory contrast that divides opinions on its place in pizza tradition. Invented in 1962 by Greek-born Canadian restaurateur Sam Panopoulos at the Satellite Restaurant in Chatham, Ontario, the topping idea stemmed from his experimentation with canned pineapple to attract late-night customers, inspired by Asian sweet-savory dishes. Despite its Canadian origins and lack of ties to Hawaii, the combination gained global popularity but remains debated for authenticity among purists who view fruit on pizza as non-traditional.

**Veggie supreme** pizzas offer a hearty, plant-based assortment of mixed vegetables, typically including sliced onions, black olives, spinach, bell peppers, mushrooms, and tomatoes, layered over sauce and cheese for a balanced, earthy flavor profile. This topping variety emphasizes nutritional density and textural variety, with vegetables providing freshness and subtle sweetness that complement the melted cheese. Common in vegetarian menus, it highlights seasonal produce to create a supreme medley that appeals to those seeking lighter, fiber-rich options without meat.

### Crust Styles

The crust of a pizza serves as its foundational element, influencing texture, structure, and overall eating experience through variations in thickness, bake method, and ingredients. Traditional styles emphasize distinct profiles: soft and airy interiors contrasted with crisp exteriors, achieved via specific dough hydration and oven temperatures. These differences allow for foldable slices in some cases or hearty, pan-baked slabs in others, catering to diverse preferences while maintaining the pizza's versatility.

Neapolitan crust is characterized by its soft, chewy texture with a prominent raised edge known as the cornicione, resulting from a high-hydration dough baked at temperatures exceeding 450°C (840°F) for 60-90 seconds in a wood-fired oven. This rapid, intense heat creates a thin central base, no more than 3 mm thick, that remains tender and fragrant, while the cornicione puffs up to about 1-2 cm high, forming an airy, leopard-spotted rim free of bubbles in the center. The Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana (AVPN) regulates these features to ensure authenticity, specifying a round shape with a maximum diameter of 35 cm and a swollen, lightweight edge that enhances flavor absorption from toppings.

New York-style crust offers a medium-thin profile, typically 2-3 mm thick at the base, designed to be foldable for easy handheld consumption with a crisp exterior and slightly chewy interior. Originally baked in coal-fired ovens reaching 370-425°C (700-800°F), this method imparts a well-browned, charred bottom that provides structural integrity without sogginess, allowing the large 14-18 inch pies to maintain flexibility when folded in half. The dough's moderate hydration and extended fermentation contribute to its signature balance of crispness and tenderness, distinguishing it from thinner or thicker alternatives.

Sicilian crust stands out for its thick, square form, often 2.5-4 cm deep, resembling focaccia with a spongy, bread-like interior and a crunchy bottom achieved through pan-baking at moderate temperatures around 220-250°C (430-480°F) for 15-20 minutes. This style uses a high-oil, well-hydrated dough pressed into rectangular pans, yielding a golden, chewy crumb that supports heavy toppings while offering a satisfying contrast between the soft middle and crisp edges. Cut into squares post-bake, it emphasizes volume and heartiness over foldability.

Gluten-free crust adaptations have gained traction in the 2020s, utilizing alternative flours such as rice, almond, or chickpea to replicate traditional textures amid rising demand from dietary needs and preferences. These crusts often employ binders like xanthan gum for elasticity, resulting in thinner, crispier profiles that mimic wheat-based versions, with the global market valued at USD 2.46 billion in 2023 and projected to grow at a 7.24% CAGR through 2030. Rice flour provides a neutral base for lightness, while almond flour adds nutty flavor and moisture retention, enabling home and commercial production without compromising structural integrity.

### Regional Adaptations

Regional adaptations of pizza have evolved to incorporate local ingredients, reflecting cultural preferences and available resources. In the Middle East, pizzas frequently feature lamb and hummus as toppings, aligning with traditional flavors such as spiced meats and creamy dips that emphasize regional culinary heritage. Similarly, in India, adaptations often include paneer cheese and tikka masala sauce, which introduce curry-like spices and vegetarian proteins suited to local dietary norms.

Oven technology plays a significant role in shaping regional crust characteristics. Conveyor belt ovens, commonly used in commercial chains, promote uniform thin crusts by providing consistent, automated heat distribution at temperatures around 700-800°F, enabling high-volume production with even browning. In contrast, artisanal stone ovens, prevalent in smaller operations, impart a distinctive char to the crust through direct contact with high-thermal-mass stones, fostering irregular, flavorful edges reminiscent of classic styles.

Variations in size and portability cater to social and lifestyle differences across regions. In Australia, large sheet pan pizzas accommodate group sharing, with dimensions often exceeding 16 inches to suit family or communal meals in a culture favoring hearty, shareable formats.

By the 2020s, immigration and globalization have accelerated fusion trends, such as pizzas topped with Korean BBQ elements like bulgogi and kimchi, blending bold, fermented flavors with traditional bases to appeal to diverse palates. These innovations, prominent by 2025, highlight pizza's versatility as a canvas for cultural exchange, with younger demographics driving experimentation through social media-inspired recipes.

## Regional Pizzas

### Italian Origins

The origins of pizza in Italy are deeply rooted in the Neapolitan tradition, where it emerged as a simple, affordable dish for the working class in the 18th and 19th centuries. Neapolitan pizza, recognized as a Traditional Speciality Guaranteed (TSG) by the European Union in 2010 following standards established by the Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana (AVPN) in 2004, adheres to strict guidelines for authenticity. The dough, made from type 0 or 00 soft wheat flour, natural Neapolitan yeast or brewer's yeast, salt, and water, must be formed into balls weighing 200 to 280 grams, resulting in a pizza with a diameter of 22 to 35 centimeters and a raised cornicione (border) that is soft and airy. Toppings are limited to fresh ingredients such as San Marzano tomatoes from the Agro Sarnese-Nocerino area, Fior di Latte or Mozzarella di Bufala Campana cheese, extra virgin olive oil, fresh basil, and optionally Pecorino Romano cheese or garlic, baked at 430–480°C for 60–90 seconds in a wood-fired oven to achieve a leopard-spotted char.

In contrast, Roman pizza represents a distinct regional style originating in Rome during the mid-20th century, characterized by its thin, crispy crust and focus on portability. Known as pizza al taglio, it is prepared with a high-hydration dough (around 70–80% water) using tipo 00 flour, fermented for 24–72 hours, stretched thin, and baked in large rectangular pans in electric ovens at 250–300°C for 10–15 minutes to yield a light, airy interior with a crunchy base and edges. Sold by weight and cut with scissors into irregular slices, it features simple toppings like tomato sauce, mozzarella, mortadella, or seasonal vegetables, emphasizing freshness and variety for street consumption.

Other Italian pizza variations highlight regional diversity while maintaining traditional elements. Pizza alla pala, a Roman offshoot, uses a high-hydration, long-fermented dough shaped into an elongated oval or rectangle (about 40–60 cm long), baked directly on the oven floor using a wooden paddle (pala) for a crispy exterior and fluffy interior, often topped with olive oil, rosemary, or prosciutto. In Puglia, focaccia barese—sometimes considered a pizza precursor—incorporates semolina flour and boiled potatoes in the dough for chewiness, topped with halved cherry tomatoes, black olives, oregano, and abundant olive oil, baked in sheet pans to form a dimpled, oil-soaked surface that soaks up flavors. These styles underscore Italy's emphasis on local ingredients and techniques.

Authentic Italian pizzas benefit from legal protections that safeguard their cultural and economic value. Mozzarella di Bufala Campana, essential for Neapolitan pizza, holds Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) status from the EU since 1996, restricting production to water buffalo milk from select areas in Campania and requiring traditional stretching in hot whey. Similarly, San Marzano tomatoes are protected under EU PDO as Pomodoro San Marzano dell’Agro Sarnese-Nocerino. Pizza plays a central role in Italian street food culture, particularly in Naples, where it serves as an accessible, communal meal symbolizing hospitality and daily life, with the art of the pizzaiuolo (pizza maker) inscribed on UNESCO's Intangible Cultural Heritage list in 2017.

### North American Styles

North American pizza styles evolved significantly from Italian immigrant traditions in the early 20th century, adapting to local tastes, ingredients, and commercial demands in the United States and Canada. Influenced by urban melting pots and post-World War II prosperity, these variations emphasized larger portions, bold flavors, and innovative presentations, transforming pizza into a fast-casual staple. In the U.S., styles like New York and Chicago emerged in immigrant enclaves, while California's gourmet approach reflected 1980s health-conscious trends toward fresh, lighter options. Canadian adaptations, particularly in Quebec, incorporated regional comfort foods, further diversifying the landscape.

New York-style pizza originated in the city's Little Italy neighborhood in the early 1900s, pioneered by Italian immigrants at places like Lombardi's, which received the first pizzeria license in 1905. This style features a large, typically 18-inch diameter pie with a hand-tossed, thin, foldable crust that is crispy at the edges yet pliable in the center, allowing slices to be eaten folded in half for portability. The dough, often stretched by hand, bakes in coal- or gas-fired ovens to achieve a chewy texture, commonly topped simply with tomato sauce and mozzarella, though pepperoni became a ubiquitous American addition.

Chicago deep-dish pizza was invented in 1943 at Pizzeria Uno by Ike Sewell and Ric Riccardo, who sought a heartier meal to pair with their intended tavern's cocktails. Characterized by a thick, buttery crust pressed into a deep round steel pan, it bakes into a pie-like form with inverted layers: cheese on the bottom to prevent sogginess, followed by toppings like sausage, and chunky tomato sauce spooned on top. This dense, casserole-style pizza requires 30-45 minutes to bake, yielding tall, sliceable wedges that highlight its indulgent, meal-in-one appeal.

California-style pizza gained prominence in the 1980s, largely through chef Ed LaDou's innovations at Spago in Los Angeles, where he experimented with wood-fired thin crusts and nontraditional toppings. Influenced by the era's health trends favoring fresh, vegetable-forward ingredients, it often includes gourmet elements like goat cheese, arugula, barbecue chicken, or artichoke hearts, paired with lighter sauces such as pesto or olive oil. This style, popularized by chains like California Pizza Kitchen founded in 1985, emphasized smaller, shareable pies with a focus on quality produce, reflecting West Coast culinary creativity.

In Canada, particularly Quebec, poutine pizza emerged as a regional variation during the late 20th century, adapting the province's iconic poutine—fries, cheese curds, and gravy—to a pizza base, with early examples appearing at local eateries. It typically features a crust topped with mozzarella, fresh cheese curds, and hot gravy, sometimes incorporating fries or bacon for added texture. This fusion highlights Quebec's dairy heritage and comfort food culture, appearing sporadically on menus across the country as a playful, hearty twist.

### International Variations

In Argentina, pizza has evolved into a distinct style characterized by a thick, spongy crust reminiscent of focaccia, often layered with abundant mozzarella cheese and topped with caramelized onions in the popular variant known as fugazzeta. This adaptation traces its roots to Italian immigrants in Buenos Aires, where the dough is baked to a fluffy texture that contrasts with thinner Italian originals, emphasizing cheese as a dominant filling that can exceed an inch in depth for a gooey, stretchy interior. A unique accompaniment is fainá, a dense chickpea flour flatbread baked separately and placed atop the pizza slice, providing a crispy, nutty contrast that absorbs excess cheese and enhances the meal's heartiness; this practice is so ingrained that locals often order "pizza con fainá" as a standard combination.

Brazilian pizza diverges notably with its embrace of unconventional and often sweet toppings, reflecting the country's multicultural influences and love for bold flavors, where varieties are commonly served in churrascarias—traditional steakhouses that pair them with grilled meats. Toppings may include hearts of palm for a tender, vegetal crunch alongside mozzarella, or sweeter options like sliced bananas drizzled with chocolate, creating dessert-like pizzas that balance savory dough with fruity indulgence. These innovations highlight Brazil's pizza culture, where numerous topping combinations can feature local ingredients such as fresh corn or pineapple, adapting the dish to regional tastes since its introduction via Italian immigrants in the early 20th century.

Indian adaptations of pizza incorporate masala spices and local proteins, with chains like Domino's introducing varieties such as the Indi Tandoori Paneer, featuring marinated paneer cubes, capsicum, red paprika, and mint mayo on a spiced base to evoke tandoori flavors. By 2025, expansions include the Ultimate Masala Paneer Pizza, loaded with tikka-methi marinated paneer, green and red peppers, jalapeños, red onion, and mozzarella on a custom sauce, alongside chicken options like Gunpowder Chicken with cumin-coriander seasoning. These fusions blend pizza's structure with Indian staples like spiced paneer and tandoori chicken, catering to vegetarian preferences and regional heat levels while maintaining global brand consistency.

## Dessert and Alternative Pizzas

### Dessert Pizzas

Dessert pizzas adapt the classic pizza format to sweet indulgences, typically employing a lightly sweetened dough or cookie-style base to support toppings like fruits, chocolates, and creams, often baked at moderate temperatures to integrate flavors without sogginess. These variants prioritize dessert-like textures, contrasting the savory profiles of traditional pizzas while maintaining the shared round, shareable presentation.

Fruit-based dessert pizzas commonly feature a grilled or baked dough base enhanced with cinnamon-spiced apples and caramel elements for a warm, autumnal appeal. In one representative preparation, a tender crust is topped with sautéed apples mixed with cinnamon and sugar, layered under a buttery streusel crumble, and finished with a homemade caramel drizzle to add richness and shine. This style evokes pie-like comfort, with the apples providing tartness balanced by the sweet, spiced crust.

Chocolate pizzas emphasize indulgent spreads and mix-ins on a pre-baked base, such as Nutella layered with sliced bananas and mini marshmallows, followed by a short bake to toast and meld the components. The hazelnut-chocolate base offers creaminess, while bananas contribute fresh moisture and marshmallows create gooey pockets upon heating. Cannoli-inspired versions shift to a ricotta-focused profile, using a shortbread or puff pastry crust spread with sweetened ricotta cream blended with mascarpone, then dusted with powdered sugar and chopped pistachios for crunch and nutty depth. The filling mimics the silky, tangy essence of Sicilian cannoli shells, delivering an elegant, no-fry alternative.

By 2025, seasonal trends have elevated dessert pizzas in US chains, with fall offerings like pumpkin spice varieties incorporating spiced pumpkin ricotta or sauces on dough bases for cozy depth, as seen in limited-time items from pizzerias embracing the flavor profile. Berry pizzas also surge in popularity during autumn, featuring fresh or mixed berries atop cream cheese or whipped ricotta layers on a crisp crust, providing bright acidity to counter richer elements.

### Non-Traditional Bases

Non-traditional pizza bases represent a shift toward dietary inclusivity, accommodating low-carbohydrate needs, gluten sensitivities, and plant-based preferences through innovative substitutions for wheat dough. These alternatives prioritize functionality, such as reduced carbs or allergen avoidance, while maintaining pizza's structural integrity for toppings. Developments in this area have accelerated with consumer demand for health-focused and sustainable options, enabling broader access to pizza without compromising flavor or texture.

Cauliflower crust emerged as a prominent low-carb innovation in the 2010s, driven by the rise of keto and gluten-free diets that sought vegetable-based substitutes for traditional dough. Typically prepared by ricing and steaming cauliflower florets, then blending them with eggs, mozzarella cheese, and seasonings to form a bindable mixture, this base bakes into a crisp exterior with a tender interior. Its popularity surged after health bloggers popularized homemade versions around 2015, leading to widespread adoption in restaurants and frozen products by the late decade, with menu mentions increasing over 1,700% in the U.S. from 2015 to 2019. Cauliflower's neutral taste and high fiber content make it versatile, though it requires pre-baking to prevent sogginess under heavy toppings.

Gluten-free bases have proliferated alongside heightened celiac disease awareness, as improved diagnostics have identified more cases globally, prompting a boom in alternative flours. Quinoa flour, derived from the nutrient-dense pseudocereal, forms a hearty crust when mixed with water and baked, offering complete protein and a subtle nutty profile that supports pizza's chewiness without wheat.

Exotic bases cater to ketogenic diets by leveraging vegetables for minimal carbs and maximal satiety. Zucchini crust involves grating and straining the vegetable to extract moisture, then combining it with eggs and cheese for a bakeable dough that mimics flatbread texture. Portobello mushroom caps, with their wide, sturdy structure, function as ready-made bases after gills are removed and caps are roasted, providing an earthy foundation that absorbs sauce and toppings effectively. These options, popular in low-carb communities since the mid-2010s, emphasize whole-food simplicity while fitting strict macronutrient profiles.

## Nutrition

### Nutritional Profile

A typical slice of cheese pizza, representing 1/8 of a 14-inch pie and weighing about 107 grams, provides 285 calories, with the majority derived from carbohydrates in the crust at approximately 35.6 grams (50% of total calories). Total fat, primarily from the cheese topping, contributes 10.4 grams (33% of calories), while protein from the cheese and dough amounts to 12.2 grams (17% of calories). These macronutrient proportions reflect a standard frozen, cooked cheese pizza with regular crust, where the dough accounts for roughly 60% of the caloric content through refined carbohydrates, cheese supplies most of the fats and proteins, and additional toppings can alter the balance.

Key micronutrients in a standard cheese pizza slice include calcium from the cheese, providing about 179-200 milligrams (14-15% of the daily value), which supports bone health. The tomato-based sauce contributes lycopene, a potent antioxidant carotenoid, with roughly 2 milligrams per slice from one tablespoon of sauce, aiding in cellular protection. Iron content varies by toppings; for instance, adding spinach can increase iron to 2-3 milligrams per slice, enhancing its role in oxygen transport, though a plain cheese slice offers about 2.3 milligrams.

Nutritional data for pizza often references USDA standards, where a single slice aligns with the above values, but a whole 14-inch cheese pizza totals around 2,280 calories, 83 grams of fat, 284 grams of carbohydrates, and 97 grams of protein, allowing for scaled analysis based on portion size. These figures draw from USDA FoodData Central entries updated through 2020 and beyond, emphasizing variability in serving sizes for dietary tracking.

### Health Considerations

Pizza consumption is often associated with elevated intake of sodium and saturated fats, primarily from processed meats such as pepperoni, sausage, and bacon, which can contribute to hypertension and cardiovascular risks. According to World Health Organization guidelines, limiting sodium intake to less than 2 grams per day is essential to prevent high blood pressure, yet a single slice of pizza topped with processed meats can contain over 700 milligrams of sodium, representing a significant portion of the daily limit. Similarly, the saturated fats in cheese and meats on traditional pizzas exceed recommended levels, increasing the risk of heart disease when consumed frequently.

To mitigate these concerns, opting for balanced pizza options loaded with vegetables can enhance dietary fiber intake, typically providing 5-10 grams per slice depending on toppings like spinach, bell peppers, and mushrooms, which support digestive health and satiety. These vegetable-rich varieties align with Mediterranean diet principles, emphasizing plant-based foods to reduce inflammation and promote overall cardiovascular benefits through antioxidants and fiber.

Pizza also poses allergen risks due to gluten in wheat-based crusts and dairy in cheese, affecting individuals with celiac disease, wheat allergies, or lactose intolerance. The rise of vegan alternatives, using plant-based cheeses and meat substitutes, addresses these issues while aiding in weight management and broader dietary inclusivity.

Health experts recommend moderation in pizza consumption through portion control, such as limiting portions to fit within a 2,000-kilocalorie daily intake, in line with the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, to balance enjoyment with nutrient-dense meals and prevent excess calorie, sodium, and fat accumulation.

### Flatbread Precursors

The development of pizza as a topped flatbread draws from a long tradition of ancient and historical precursors in the Middle East, Asia, and the Mediterranean, where simple doughs were baked and often enhanced with minimal toppings like herbs, oils, or seeds. These flatbreads, emerging as early as the Neolithic period, provided the foundational techniques for crust formation and basic embellishment that later influenced Italian pizza variants.

Naan, a yeast-leavened flatbread with origins in Persia, is first documented in 1300 CE, though its baking traditions in tandoor ovens likely predate this in the region, and sometimes topped with simple ingredients like yogurt or herbs for flavor. Archaeological and linguistic evidence links early forms of flatbreads to Central Asian and Persian traditions, serving as a portable base for modest accompaniments in daily meals. In its traditional preparation, naan dough is stretched thin and baked against hot clay walls, creating a soft, chewy texture akin to early pizza crusts.

Matzo, an unleavened flatbread from the ancient Near East, has origins in prehistoric barley-based breads dating back around 14,400 years, with evidence from sites in the Jordanian Black Desert and broader Mesopotamian and Levantine regions indicating its use as a quick-baked staple for laborers and travelers, occasionally dusted with salt or herbs. Evolving within early Semitic cultures, matzo's thin, cracker-like form—prepared without rising time—mirrors the hasty baking methods that prefigured pizza's simple bases, particularly in regions where wheat cultivation supported minimal toppings for sustenance. Later associations with Jewish ritual during the Babylonian Exile (circa 586 BCE) preserved its form, but its precursor role lies in broader ancient flatbread practices.

Focaccia, a Ligurian flatbread drizzled with olive oil, has ancient Roman roots as a hearth-baked flatbread known as panis focacius, serving as a direct precursor to white pizza styles without tomato. This bread's dimpled surface, created by pressing fingers into the dough before baking, facilitated oil absorption and topping adhesion, techniques that echoed in early Neapolitan flatbreads. While flatbread baking predates Rome in Neolithic Mesopotamia (7000–5000 BCE), the Roman iteration formalized its role in Mediterranean cuisine.

Pita and lavash, Levantine pocket breads from the Fertile Crescent, date to around 2000 BCE, with archaeological evidence from Jordanian sites showing thin doughs baked on hot stones or in ovens, often sprinkled with herbs like za'atar or sesame for subtle flavoring. Pita's characteristic pocket forms during high-heat baking, creating a cavity suitable for simple inserts, while lavash's ultra-thin sheets, with origins in Armenian and Iranian traditions dating back to the 3rd millennium BCE, were rolled around herbs or oils as portable precursors to topped bases. These breads' versatility in Levantine and Caucasian diets highlighted early experimentation with flat doughs as carriers for regional seasonings.

Iranian sangak, a stone-baked flatbread with sesame seeds, parallels early crust techniques through its preparation on heated pebbles in a tannur oven, with historical records from the 11th century CE describing it as army rations, building on earlier Persian flatbread traditions. The dough, stretched across small river stones, develops a crisp exterior and airy interior, often topped lightly with seeds or water for texture, influencing the rustic baking approaches seen in pizza's evolution. This pebble-baking innovation ensured even heat distribution, a principle foundational to durable flatbread crusts.

### Contemporary Analogs

Calzones and strombolis represent Italian-American adaptations of pizza that enclose fillings within folded or rolled dough, creating portable baked pockets distinct from open-faced pizzas. The calzone, while rooted in 18th-century Neapolitan street food traditions, gained prominence in Italian-American communities during the mid-20th century as a convenient meal option, typically prepared by folding pizza dough over a filling of mozzarella, ricotta, cured meats like salami or prosciutto, and vegetables such as spinach or peppers, then baking until golden and crisp. Strombolis, a close relative, emerged specifically in the 1950s in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, credited to Italian immigrant Nazzareno Romano at his pizzeria; they differ by being rolled into a cylindrical shape rather than semicircular, often incorporating pepperoni, sausage, onions, and provolone cheese within the dough before baking, resulting in a denser, elongated form that emphasizes layered flavors.

Lahmacun, often dubbed Turkish pizza, offers a thin, cracker-like flatbread base analogous to pizza dough but prepared with a spiced minced meat topping, setting it apart through its rolled consumption and absence of cheese. Originating from Ottoman culinary influences, lahmacun is made by spreading a mixture of ground lamb or beef, chopped onions, tomatoes, parsley, garlic, and red peppers seasoned with paprika, cumin, and black pepper onto unleavened dough, which is then baked at high heat for a crispy texture; it is traditionally eaten by rolling the baked flatbread around fresh herbs, lemon juice, or salad for a handheld bite.

Mexican quesadillas and tostadas provide grilled or fried flatbread alternatives to pizza, utilizing corn or flour tortillas as bases for cheese and toppings in a quicker, non-oven preparation method. A quesadilla involves folding a tortilla over melted cheese—often Oaxaca or queso fresco—along with optional additions like shredded chicken, beans, or jalapeños, then grilling it on a comal or skillet until the exterior is toasted and the interior gooey, creating a crisp yet soft contrast similar to pizza's crust and melt. Tostadas, by contrast, employ a flat, fried corn tortilla shell as an open platform for layered toppings such as refried beans, lettuce, avocado, cheese, and salsa, fried briefly to achieve crunchiness without folding, which allows for heavier, stacked assemblies that echo pizza's topping diversity but emphasize freshness over baking.

Baozi-pizza fusions, known as "baozza," illustrate 21st-century global culinary experimentation by adapting steamed Chinese baozi buns into topped vessels reminiscent of pizza, blending Eastern steaming techniques with Western toppings in urban fusion scenes. Emerging in the early 2020s in cities like Beijing and Shanghai, these creations involve stuffing or topping soft, steamed wheat buns with ingredients such as tomato sauce, mozzarella, pepperoni, or even Asian-inspired elements like BBQ pork and scallions, then finishing with a quick bake or steam to meld flavors, as seen in offerings at international chains and pop-up eateries.
