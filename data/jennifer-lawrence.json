  "content": "# Jennifer Lawrence\n\nJennifer Shrader Lawrence (born August 15, 1990) is an American actress whose career trajectory exemplifies rapid ascent from independent films to blockbuster franchises and critical acclaim. Raised in Louisville, Kentucky, by a construction firm owner father and a summer camp manager mother, she experienced a non-traditional education due to social challenges and hyperactivity, leading to homeschooling before pursuing acting opportunities in New York at age 14.\n\nLawrence's breakthrough arrived with her lead role as Ree Dolly in the independent drama *Winter's Bone* (2010), earning her Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations for Best Actress at age 20. She secured her first Oscar for Best Actress portraying Tiffany Maxwell in *Silver Linings Playbook* (2012), becoming the second-youngest recipient in that category, followed by supporting turns in *American Hustle* (2013) and *Joy* (2015), both directed by David O. Russell, which contributed to three Golden Globe wins. Her portrayal of Katniss Everdeen in *The Hunger Games* series (2012–2015) and Mystique in multiple *X-Men* films cemented her as a box-office draw, with those franchises generating billions in global revenue, while establishing her among Hollywood's highest-paid performers, reportedly earning up to $10 million per film by the mid-2010s.\n\nIn 2014, Lawrence became a prominent victim of the iCloud celebrity photo hacking scandal, in which private nude images were illegally distributed online; she publicly condemned the incident as a \"sex crime\" and pursued legal action against perpetrators. Subsequent career choices reflected a pivot toward selective, character-driven projects like *Causeway* (2022) and *No Hard Feelings* (2023), alongside producing under her Excellent Cadaver banner, amid a reported net worth exceeding $160 million as of 2025 derived from acting, endorsements, and production deals. While praised for authenticity and range, her post-peak output has drawn scrutiny for perceived selectivity possibly influenced by personal privacy concerns following the breach, though she maintains a low public profile outside work.\n\n## Early life\n\n### Upbringing and family background\n\nJennifer Shrader Lawrence was born on August 15, 1990, in Indian Hills, a suburb northeast of Louisville, Kentucky. Her father, Gary Lawrence, owned a construction company, while her mother, Karen (née Koch), managed a children's summer camp. Lawrence has two older brothers, Blaine and Ben, with whom she was raised in a close-knit family environment.\n\nThe family resided on a horse farm outside Louisville, where Lawrence spent her childhood engaged in outdoor and athletic pursuits. Her parents enforced a household rule requiring all three children to participate in team sports, leading Lawrence to join cheerleading, field hockey, softball, and even a boys' basketball team coached by her father. These activities reflected a typical Midwestern American upbringing emphasizing physical activity and family involvement, with local observers later crediting the grounded Louisville setting for fostering her resilience and interpersonal skills.\n\nLawrence attended Kammerer Middle School in Louisville during her early education, though she described herself as an energetic child prone to hyperactivity. By age 14, amid growing interest in acting, she left formal schooling without completing middle school or obtaining a high school diploma or GED, opting instead for self-directed learning.\n\n### Entry into acting and early training\n\nLawrence first expressed interest in acting during her childhood in Louisville, Kentucky, where she participated in school plays and local theater productions. At age nine, she took on an early role portraying a sex worker in a church play based on the Book of Jonah.\n\nIn 2005, at age 14, Lawrence traveled to New York City with her mother specifically to explore opportunities in acting and modeling, visiting talent agencies and securing representation from a scout who recognized her potential.  Persuading her parents to support her ambitions, she dropped out of middle school and relocated to New York to pursue a professional career full-time, forgoing traditional education in favor of self-directed learning.\n\nLacking any formal acting training or enrollment in professional schools, Lawrence relied on innate talent and practical experience gained through relentless auditions.  Her early efforts included securing commercial work, such as an advertisement for MTV's *My Super Sweet 16*, which provided initial exposure and honed her skills on set. This on-the-job approach, combined with her instinctive method of minimal preparation and line memorization, formed the basis of her development as an actress before transitioning to more substantial television roles.\n\n## Acting career\n\n### Early roles and breakthrough (2006–2011)\n\nLawrence's professional acting career began in 2006 with a minor role in the unaired television pilot *Company Town*. She followed this with guest appearances on episodes of *Monk*, *Cold Case*, and *Medium* that year.\n\nIn 2007, at age 16, Lawrence secured her first major role as Lauren Pearson, the rebellious teenage daughter in the TBS sitcom *The Bill Engvall Show*, which aired from July 17, 2007, to September 5, 2009, across three seasons. The series, starring comedian Bill Engvall as her father, a counselor dispensing \"tough love\" advice, provided Lawrence with steady television exposure during her late teens.\n\nTransitioning to film, Lawrence debuted on screen in 2008 with a supporting role as Sally in the independent drama *Garden Party*. That year, she also starred as Agnes in *The Poker House*, portraying a teenager enduring abuse in a troubled household, marking her first lead in a feature. Additionally, she appeared as young Mariana in Guillermo Arriaga's *The Burning Plain*, a role filmed earlier but released in 2008.\n\nLawrence achieved her breakthrough in 2010 with the lead role of Ree Dolly in *Winter's Bone*, directed by Debra Granik. In the film, set in the rural Ozarks, she played a 17-year-old girl searching for her absent father amid poverty and methamphetamine culture, delivering a performance critics hailed for its raw intensity and authenticity. Premiering at the Sundance Film Festival on January 14, 2010, where it won the Grand Jury Prize, the film earned Lawrence an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress—the youngest nominee in that category at age 20—along with widespread acclaim for elevating her from obscurity.\n\nIn 2011, Lawrence took a small supporting role as Sam in the romantic drama *Like Crazy*, playing a colleague who aids in uncovering a deception. Later that year, she was cast as the shapeshifting mutant Mystique in *X-Men: First Class*, announced in July 2010, with the film releasing on May 25, 2011, marking her entry into major studio franchises. This role, requiring extensive prosthetic makeup, built on her rising profile from *Winter's Bone* and positioned her for broader commercial success.\n\n### Rise to stardom and commercial success (2012–2015)\n\nLawrence's portrayal of Katniss Everdeen in *The Hunger Games*, released on March 23, 2012, propelled her to international stardom, with the film grossing $694.4 million worldwide against a $78 million budget. The adaptation of Suzanne Collins' novel emphasized themes of survival and rebellion, and Lawrence's performance as the resilient archer was credited with anchoring the dystopian narrative's success.\n\nIn November 2012, Lawrence starred as Tiffany Maxwell in *Silver Linings Playbook*, a romantic comedy-drama that earned $236.4 million globally and secured her the Academy Award for Best Actress on February 24, 2013, making her the second-youngest winner in that category at age 22. The film's critical acclaim, including eight Oscar nominations, highlighted Lawrence's ability to blend vulnerability with intensity, contrasting her action-hero role.\n\nThe sequel *The Hunger Games: Catching Fire*, released November 22, 2013, amplified her commercial dominance, earning $865 million worldwide and becoming the highest-grossing film in the franchise up to that point. Lawrence also appeared in *American Hustle* (December 2013), earning a Best Supporting Actress nomination, and reprised her role as Mystique in *X-Men: Days of Future Past* (May 23, 2014), which grossed $747.9 million globally. These projects underscored her versatility across genres, driving audience draw.\n\nBy 2014, *The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1* (November 21) added $755.4 million to her box-office tally, reinforcing the franchise's cultural impact. In 2015, Lawrence concluded the year with *Joy* (December 25), portraying inventor Joy Mangano and receiving another Best Actress nomination, while *The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2* (November 20) grossed $653.4 million. Her films from this period collectively exceeded $3 billion in worldwide earnings, establishing her as a bankable star.\n\nForbes ranked Lawrence the world's highest-paid actress in 2015, with pretax earnings of $52 million from June 2014 to June 2015, primarily from *Hunger Games* installments and endorsements. This financial milestone reflected her transition from indie acclaim to blockbuster reliability, though critics noted the reliance on franchise vehicles for peak success.\n\n### Mid-career experiments and fluctuations (2016–2023)\n\nLawrence continued her involvement in major franchises with the role of Mystique in *X-Men: Apocalypse* (2016), directed by Bryan Singer, which earned $542.5 million worldwide against a production budget exceeding $170 million, though it received mixed critical reviews with a 47% Tomatometer score on Rotten Tomatoes. Later that year, she starred opposite Chris Pratt in the science fiction romance *Passengers* (2016), directed by Morten Tyldum, which grossed $302.2 million globally but faced criticism for its ethical implications and narrative choices, scoring 30% from critics while achieving modest profitability on its $110 million budget. These projects marked an extension of her action-oriented persona but introduced romantic and speculative elements diverging from her prior dramatic peaks.\n\nIn 2017, Lawrence took a significant artistic risk with Darren Aronofsky's allegorical horror film *mother!*, portraying a beleaguered homemaker in a story interpreted as a biblical parable; the film opened to $7.5 million domestically and totaled $44.5 million worldwide against a $30 million budget, earning an F CinemaScore from audiences and polarizing reviews at 68% on Rotten Tomatoes, with detractors citing its intensity as alienating. This departure from commercial blockbusters highlighted her willingness to experiment with provocative, auteur-driven material amid declining franchise momentum. The following year, she led Francis Lawrence's espionage thriller *Red Sparrow* (2018) as a Russian ballerina trained as a seductress, which grossed $151.6 million on a $69 million budget but garnered middling reception at 45% critics' score, often faulted for formulaic plotting despite her committed performance.\n\nHer final X-Men outing, *Dark Phoenix* (2019), directed by Simon Kinberg, concluded the prequel series with Lawrence again as Mystique; budgeted at around $200 million, it underperformed with $246.4 million worldwide and a dismal 22% Tomatometer, contributing to a $133 million studio loss and signaling the franchise's fatigue after years of inconsistent quality. Following this, Lawrence entered a self-imposed hiatus from 2019 to 2021, citing burnout, creative exhaustion, and a desire for personal life balance after a decade of relentless output; in a 2021 Vanity Fair interview, she described feeling \"stifled\" and contemplated permanent retirement, viewing the break as liberating despite coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic. This period reflected career fluctuations, as her post-*Hunger Games* films yielded diminishing returns compared to earlier $800 million-plus blockbusters, prompting a reevaluation of high-stakes commitments.\n\nReturning via streaming, Lawrence co-starred in Adam McKay's satirical comedy *Don't Look Up* (2021) on Netflix as a scientist warning of an impending comet strike, which amassed over 321 million viewing hours in its first weeks—becoming one of the platform's most-watched films—but divided critics at 56% on Rotten Tomatoes for its heavy-handed allegory on climate denial and media apathy. In 2022, she produced and starred in the introspective drama *Causeway*, directed by Lila Neugebauer, playing a brain-injured veteran grappling with reintegration; released on Apple TV+, it earned stronger acclaim at 84% critics' score for its subdued realism, though its limited theatrical run underscored the shift to prestige streaming over wide releases. Her 2023 R-rated comedy *No Hard Feelings*, written and directed by Gene Stupnitsky, saw her as a cash-strapped escort in a raunchy premise, grossing $85 million worldwide on a low $20 million budget and receiving a solid 71% Tomatometer, marking a commercial rebound through genre experimentation in broad humor. Overall, this era showcased Lawrence's pivot toward diverse, riskier roles amid box office variability, prioritizing artistic control via her production company over guaranteed franchise appeal.\n\n### Recent projects and potential resurgence (2024–present)\n\nIn 2024, Lawrence maintained a lower acting profile amid personal milestones, including the announcement of her second pregnancy in October, while focusing on production work through her company Bread and Circuses. She served as executive producer on *Zurawski v. Texas*, a documentary examining a Texas abortion case and its legal implications, which premiered at the AFI Fest on October 23, 2024. This project aligned with her prior advocacy interests but marked no on-screen return that year, following her 2023 comedy *No Hard Feelings*.\n\nLawrence's acting resurgence gained momentum in 2025 with the release of *Die, My Love*, a psychological black comedy-drama directed by Lynne Ramsay, in which she stars alongside Robert Pattinson. Adapted from Ariana Harwicz's novel, the film portrays a woman's descent into obsession and violence in a rural setting, with production wrapping in 2024 after principal photography began earlier that year.  Early industry anticipation positioned it as a potential showcase for Lawrence's dramatic range, building on Ramsay's reputation for intense character studies like *We Need to Talk About Kevin*, though full critical reception awaited its November theatrical rollout.\n\nLooking ahead, Lawrence signed on for A24's *Why Don't You Love Me?*, announced in July 2024, adapting Paul B. Rainey's 2023 graphic novel into a darkly comedic exploration of a deteriorating marriage, with Lawrence producing via Bread and Circuses. She is also attached to lead Apple TV+'s *The Wives*, a murder mystery thriller developed with A24, signaling a pivot toward auteur-driven, genre-blending projects post-motherhood hiatus. These commitments, coupled with *Die, My Love*'s pre-release buzz, suggest a strategic re-entry emphasizing prestige roles over franchise obligations, potentially revitalizing her box-office draw after a selective phase prioritizing family and fewer, higher-caliber scripts.\n\n## Artistry and critical reception\n\n### Acting technique and versatility\n\nJennifer Lawrence has described her acting approach as instinctive and spontaneous, eschewing prolonged preparation in favor of immersing herself in character moments just before filming. In a 2023 interview, she expressed discomfort with method acting, stating it makes her \"nervous\" due to uncertainty in interacting with actors who remain in character off-camera, and contrasted this with her preference for Christian Bale's technique of readiness achieved \"10 seconds to action.\" This aligns with accounts of her minimal rehearsal process, where she relies on emotional presence and organic connection to deliver authentic performances rather than technical exercises or extensive backstory development.\n\nHer technique emphasizes naturalism and relatability, drawing from personal emotional recall to portray grounded, human responses, which critics have noted contributes to her convincing depictions of ordinary people under duress. This method proved effective in early roles like Ree Dolly in *Winter's Bone* (2010), where her raw, unpolished intensity earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress at age 20, highlighting her ability to convey desperation and resilience without overt mannerism.\n\nLawrence's versatility spans genres, from independent dramas to commercial franchises and comedies, evidenced by her Academy Award win for Best Actress in the dramedy *Silver Linings Playbook* (2012), where she portrayed a volatile widow with bipolar disorder, blending humor and pathos. She transitioned seamlessly to action-hero Katniss Everdeen in *The Hunger Games* series (2012–2015), embodying physical tenacity and moral resolve in a dystopian setting, while later nominations for *Joy* (2015) and *mother!* (2017) demonstrated range in historical biopics and psychological horror. Critics have praised this adaptability, with *Vulture* in 2014 describing her shift from gritty indie fare to blockbuster leads as \"astounding,\" though some observers question whether her inherent likability occasionally constrains deeper villainous or abstract roles. Her work in *Causeway* (2022), playing a brain-injured veteran, further showcased understated emotional depth, earning acclaim for subtlety over histrionics.\n\n### Strengths and limitations in roles\n\nLawrence has demonstrated strengths in portraying resilient, emotionally vulnerable characters in independent dramas, as evidenced by her Academy Award-nominated performance as Ree Dolly in *Winter's Bone* (2010), where critics praised her raw authenticity and physical commitment to the role of a determined teenager in rural poverty. Her ability to convey naturalism without overt technical display aligns with an instinctive approach, drawing from personal flaws and vulnerabilities to achieve convincing realism, as she described in interviews emphasizing honest character construction over method immersion.\n\nIn comedic and dramatic hybrids, Lawrence excels at blending humor with pathos, notably in *Silver Linings Playbook* (2012), where her portrayal of Tiffany Maxwell earned her the Academy Award for Best Actress for its energetic wit and underlying fragility, showcasing charisma that elevates ensemble dynamics. This versatility extends to roles requiring physical comedy, as in *No Hard Feelings* (2023), where her raunchy, self-deprecating performance revitalized her box-office appeal through unforced relatability.\n\nHowever, limitations emerge in roles demanding accent work, period authenticity, or stylistic exaggeration, such as her Russian accent in *Red Sparrow* (2018), which drew criticism for inconsistency and strained delivery amid the film's espionage demands. In franchise entries like *The Hunger Games* series (2012–2015), some reviewers noted wooden emotional peaks and over-reliance on charm over nuanced vulnerability, attributing this to her persona's dominance in high-stakes action contexts. Her aversion to method acting—preferring rapid preparation, as stated in a 2023 interview where she expressed discomfort with immersive techniques—may constrain depth in transformative characters, favoring accessible everyperson archetypes over chameleon-like shifts. Critics have argued this results in a narrow range, with her \"relatable\" screen presence occasionally miscast in histrionic or period pieces, as in *American Hustle* (2013), where her explosive supporting turn was seen by some as disruptive to the narrative's tone despite Oscar buzz.\n\n## Public image and media portrayal\n\n### Construction of \"relatable\" celebrity persona\n\nJennifer Lawrence cultivated a public image emphasizing relatability through a series of unscripted, self-deprecating moments that contrasted with the typical polish of Hollywood stars, particularly gaining traction after her breakthrough roles in the late 2000s and early 2010s. This persona was reinforced by viral incidents, such as her stumble on the steps while accepting the Best Actress Oscar for *Silver Linings Playbook* on February 24, 2013, which she handled with humor by quipping about her dress and coordination, endearing her to audiences as authentically human rather than infallible. Similar clumsiness, like tripping at the 2013 Golden Globes and laughing it off, became emblematic of her \"down-to-earth\" appeal, often highlighted in media coverage as genuine awkwardness rather than staged antics.\n\nIn interviews, Lawrence frequently employed candid, unfiltered language, including swearing and blunt admissions about everyday struggles, which media outlets framed as refreshing authenticity. For instance, during promotional tours, she discussed personal habits like excessive snacking or discomfort in heels, positioning herself as an ordinary Midwesterner thrust into stardom despite her roots in Louisville, Kentucky, where she began acting without formal training.  This narrative was amplified by her avoidance of social media, allowing organic viral moments—such as eating pizza on camera or burping anecdotes—to dominate public perception without direct curation.\n\nCritics and observers have questioned the extent to which this relatability constitutes a deliberate PR strategy, noting inconsistencies like her 2016 admission that her work-life balance issues \"aren't exactly relatable\" to average people, yet media persisted in portraying her as the \"internet's BFF.\" Some analyses argue that repeated emphasis on imperfections, such as farting or falling, risks veering into manufactured folksiness, especially as her wealth and status diverged from the \"regular person\" she invoked.  Despite such skepticism, empirical patterns in her public behavior—from unpolished red-carpet reactions to humorous self-roasts in press junkets—suggest elements of inherent personality over pure contrivance, as these traits predated her peak fame and persisted across decades.\n\n### Evolution of public perception and scrutiny\n\nJennifer Lawrence initially garnered widespread admiration as a relatable, unpretentious figure in Hollywood during the early 2010s, with her candid humor, apparent clumsiness—such as tripping at the 2013 Academy Awards—and admissions of enjoying casual indulgences like pizza positioning her as an antithesis to polished celebrity archetypes. This persona, amplified by media portrayals following her breakthrough in *The Hunger Games* (2012), fostered an image of authenticity that resonated broadly, though some observers later questioned its spontaneity amid repeated public mishaps.\n\nBy mid-decade, however, scrutiny intensified as the \"relatable\" facade faced backlash for seeming contrived or performative, with critics and online commentators expressing fatigue over her self-deprecating anecdotes and perceived entitlement, contributing to a narrative shift from beloved ingénue to polarizing \"it girl.\" Incidents like insensitive remarks— including a 2016 joke about rape during a *Mother!* (2017) promotion and comments perceived as mocking transgender individuals—drew accusations of cultural insensitivity, further eroding her wholesome image among segments of the public.\n\nThe 2014 iCloud hack, which leaked private nude photographs of Lawrence and other celebrities on September 1, 2014, marked a pivotal escalation in privacy-related scrutiny, prompting her to describe the violation as feeling \"gang-banged by the f**king planet\" and labeling viewers as complicit in a sex crime; the perpetrator, Ryan Collins, received an eight-month prison sentence in August 2018. This event not only heightened objectification debates but also influenced her subsequent roles, such as the nude scene in *Red Sparrow* (2018), which she defended as reclaiming agency despite ongoing trauma.\n\nIn recent years, following a career hiatus after her second child's birth in 2024 and selective projects like *Causeway* (2022), Lawrence's public perception has evolved toward a more reserved, introspective maternal figure, with candid discussions of postpartum isolation—\"you feel like an alien\"—and creative shifts post-motherhood signaling a deliberate retreat from relentless scrutiny. This phase has elicited mixed responses, including praise for authenticity amid Hollywood's elite detachment critiques, though lingering perceptions of industry favoritism persist in some circles.\n\n## Political views and activism\n\n### Transition from conservative roots to liberal advocacy\n\nJennifer Lawrence was raised in a conservative household in Louisville, Kentucky, where her family held Republican views, influencing her early political outlook.  Her upbringing exposed her to the fiscal advantages of certain Republican policies, such as lower taxes and limited government spending, which she initially endorsed. In her first presidential election in 2008, at age 18, Lawrence voted for Republican nominee John McCain, reflecting alignment with her family's perspectives and a self-described \"little Republican\" stance. \n\nThe shift began during Barack Obama's presidency (2009–2017), as Lawrence reflected on policy implications for social issues, particularly women's rights, leading her to conclude she had previously voted against her own interests.  A pivotal moment occurred when she encountered a line from the television series *30 Rock*—a joke highlighting perceived Republican inconsistencies on limited government intervention in personal versus reproductive matters—which prompted her to question and ultimately abandon her Republican identification.  By the mid-2010s, amid rising cultural and political debates, she embraced Democratic positions, publicly endorsing Obama in subsequent elections and critiquing conservative social policies.\n\nThis evolution strained family ties, as her relatives retained conservative allegiances, culminating in tensions exacerbated by events like the 2022 Supreme Court decision overturning *Roe v. Wade*, which Lawrence attributed to Republican judicial appointments.  She has described efforts to forgive her family, including her father and sister, for their ongoing support of Republican figures, while maintaining that her advocacy stems from recognizing \"social horrors\" overlooked in her earlier fiscal-focused worldview.  By 2016, Lawrence's transition solidified into active liberal engagement, including opposition to Donald Trump and promotion of voter mobilization, marking a departure from her Kentucky roots toward Hollywood-influenced progressive causes. \n\n### Key endorsements, campaigns, and initiatives\n\nLawrence publicly endorsed Democratic vice presidential candidate Kamala Harris and her running mate Tim Walz for the 2024 U.S. presidential election on September 24, 2024, stating that her primary motivation was Harris's commitment to protecting reproductive rights, particularly access to abortion, which she described as \"literally on the ballot.\" She emphasized Harris's candidacy as a bulwark against policies that could further restrict abortion nationwide, contrasting it with the potential outcomes under a Republican administration. In support of this endorsement, Lawrence participated in door-to-door canvassing for the Harris campaign in Las Vegas, Nevada, on November 3, 2024, just days before the election.\n\nAs a board member of the anti-corruption nonprofit RepresentUs, Lawrence has promoted initiatives aimed at reforming campaign finance and reducing political influence by special interests, including the \"Unbreaking America\" video series launched in 2018, which critiques systemic corruption in U.S. governance. She advocated for the For the People Act, a federal bill introduced in 2021 to expand voting rights, limit dark money in elections, and implement public financing for campaigns, urging public calls to senators for its passage via RepresentUs platforms. In 2018, she endorsed Colorado ballot measures Proposition 112 (to regulate oil and gas drilling setbacks) and Proposition 109 (to issue bonds for highway improvements), framing them as steps toward accountable state governance.\n\nLawrence has focused on reproductive rights advocacy, defending Planned Parenthood in January 2016 amid controversies over undercover videos alleging misconduct, recounting her own use of the organization's services for birth control as a teenager and calling attacks on it an assault on women seeking basic healthcare. She joined the Women's March Rally for Abortion Justice in Washington, D.C., on October 2, 2021, protesting potential restrictions following the Supreme Court's review of Texas's SB8 law. In October 2020, she opposed Missouri Amendment 3, a right-to-work ballot measure, through a campaign video arguing it would undermine workers' rights and collective bargaining. Additionally, as an executive producer, she backed the 2024 documentary *Zurawski v. Texas*, which examines the real-world effects of Texas's post-*Roe* abortion restrictions, in collaboration with figures including Hillary Clinton.\n\n## Controversies and criticisms\n\n### Privacy violations and personal scandals\n\nIn late August 2014, private nude photographs of Lawrence were leaked online after hackers accessed her iCloud account, along with those of over 100 other celebrities, in an event known as \"The Fappening.\" The breach exploited vulnerabilities in iCloud backups, allowing unauthorized downloads of personal images via phishing attacks and weak security practices.\n\nLawrence described the incident as a \"sex crime\" and \"sexual violation\" in an October 2014 Vanity Fair interview, rejecting characterizations of it as a mere scandal and emphasizing that viewing the images perpetuated the harm. She advocated for stronger laws against such digital invasions, stating, \"The law needs to be changed, and we need to change.\" The Federal Bureau of Investigation launched an inquiry, leading to charges against multiple perpetrators; Ryan Collins, who admitted to hacking Lawrence's and others' accounts, was sentenced to 18 months in prison in 2016 after pleading guilty to unauthorized computer access.\n\nLawrence opted not to pursue civil lawsuits against websites hosting the images, citing concerns that legal battles would amplify publicity and further exploit the violation. In a 2021 Variety interview, she revealed the leak's lasting psychological toll, noting it made her wary of sharing personal content and haunted her sense of security years later. No additional major privacy breaches or personal scandals involving Lawrence have been publicly documented beyond this event and routine celebrity paparazzi intrusions, which she has criticized as invasive but not equivalent in scale.\n\n### Public statements and cultural insensitivities\n\nIn December 2016, Jennifer Lawrence recounted an anecdote on *The Graham Norton Show* about an incident during the 2013 filming of *The Hunger Games: Catching Fire* in Hawaii's Waimea Valley, where she scratched an itch on her buttocks against ancient rocks considered sacred by Native Hawaiians, causing one to dislodge and nearly strike a crew member.  The remarks drew widespread criticism for trivializing and mocking the cultural significance of the site, which holds spiritual importance in Hawaiian tradition as a place of ancestral reverence and natural preservation. Lawrence issued a public apology via Facebook, stating, \"I am from Kentucky, so to me the rocks were just rocks. But I see now that it was disrespectful to the people of Hawaii and I am sorry for that,\" though some observers deemed the response insufficiently accountable for the desecration.\n\nAt the January 2016 Golden Globes, after accepting the Best Actress award for *Joy*, Lawrence faced backlash for scolding a foreign-language reporter backstage who was using his phone, reportedly to reference notes or translate questions, by exclaiming, \"Hey! Get off your phone!\"  Critics labeled the outburst rude and culturally insensitive toward non-native English speakers reliant on translation aids during high-pressure press interactions, amplifying perceptions of her as dismissive of linguistic barriers. Supporters, including Anne Hathaway, defended it as adherence to event no-phone protocols, but the incident contributed to ongoing scrutiny of her unfiltered demeanor in multicultural settings.\n\nDuring a May 2014 Vanity Fair party at the Cannes Film Festival, Lawrence made a remark interpreted as a rape joke, referencing her \"scream\" in a context that evoked non-consensual assault, prompting accusations of poor taste amid heightened public sensitivity to sexual violence discussions post high-profile cases.  The comment, delivered in a lighthearted exchange, was widely condemned online and in media for minimizing trauma, with outlets like *Cosmopolitan* highlighting it as emblematic of her boundary-pushing humor clashing with evolving norms on such topics. No formal apology followed, but the backlash underscored tensions between her self-described \"no filter\" style and expectations for celebrity restraint on grave subjects.\n\n### Professional claims and industry backlash\n\nIn a December 2022 *Variety* interview promoting her film *Causeway*, Jennifer Lawrence stated that prior to *The Hunger Games* (2012), \"nobody had ever put a woman in the lead of an action movie\" on the scale of a major studio production, positioning her role as Katniss Everdeen as a pioneering breakthrough in Hollywood's gender dynamics. This remark drew immediate criticism from film historians, critics, and social media users for overlooking established precedents, such as Sigourney Weaver's Ripley in *Alien* (1979), Linda Hamilton's Sarah Connor in *The Terminator* (1984), and Uma Thurman's Bride in *Kill Bill* (2003–2004), which had similarly featured women as central action protagonists in high-profile releases. \n\nLawrence's claim was further contested for minimizing the contributions of earlier female-led action films, including *Lara Croft: Tomb Raider* (2001) starring Angelina Jolie and *Electra* (2005) with Jennifer Garner, both backed by major studios like Paramount and 20th Century Fox. Industry observers, including panelists on Fox News' *Outnumbered*, argued that the statement negated the accomplishments of women who preceded her, potentially reflecting a lack of historical awareness despite her prominence in the field. Lawrence responded to the backlash on December 9, 2022, via her publicist, clarifying that \"it came out wrong\" and that she intended to highlight the rarity of female-led action films without romantic subplots in big-budget Hollywood contexts, though she acknowledged prior examples existed. \n\nThe controversy underscored broader industry tensions around crediting trailblazers, with some outlets framing it as emblematic of generational entitlement in Hollywood narratives. No formal professional repercussions, such as lost roles, were reported, but it contributed to discussions on Lawrence's post-*Hunger Games* career trajectory, where she has taken extended breaks and selected fewer mainstream projects amid perceptions of selective opportunities with top directors.\n\nEarlier, in a 2016 *InStyle* interview, Lawrence remarked that she preferred collaborating with male co-stars over female ones, citing reduced interpersonal drama: \"I’ve done four movies now where I’m the only girl,\" adding that all-female sets could foster competitiveness she found challenging. This elicited backlash from media commentators who viewed it as reinforcing stereotypes of female rivalry in a male-dominated industry, contrasting her public advocacy for gender equality in pay and representation. Critics, including those in feminist-leaning publications, argued it undermined solidarity efforts post-#MeToo, though Lawrence framed it as a personal observation from her experiences on films like *Joy* (2015) and *American Hustle* (2013). No widespread industry boycott ensued, but it fueled ongoing scrutiny of her \"relatable\" persona intersecting with professional dynamics.\n\n## Personal life\n\n### Relationships and marriage\n\nJennifer Lawrence's first high-profile relationship was with British actor Nicholas Hoult, whom she met while filming *X-Men: First Class* in 2010; the on-and-off romance lasted until 2014.  Following their split, she briefly dated Coldplay frontman Chris Martin starting in June 2014, with the relationship ending in October 2014 before briefly rekindling later that year and concluding by March 2015.  In 2016, Lawrence began dating director Darren Aronofsky after meeting on the set of *mother!*, with the year-long relationship ending in 2017 amid reports of differing life stages. \n\nLawrence met art gallery director Cooke Maroney in May 2018 through a mutual friend who set them up on a blind date; Maroney, born July 3, 1984, in New York City, graduated from New York University and works in the art industry.  The couple became engaged in February 2019 after less than a year of dating. They married on October 19, 2019, in an intimate ceremony at the Belcourt of Newport mansion in Rhode Island, attended by about 150 guests including celebrities like Adele and Amy Schumer; Lawrence wore a custom Ralph Lauren gown.   The pair welcomed their first child, a son named Cy, in February 2022, and as of 2024, were expecting a second child.  Lawrence has described Maroney as grounding her amid Hollywood pressures, crediting the relationship with restoring her faith in marriage after prior skepticism.\n\n### Family expansion and work-life balance\n\nJennifer Lawrence and her husband, Cooke Maroney, welcomed their first child, a son named Cy, in February 2022. The couple expanded their family further with the birth of a second child in early 2025. Lawrence has maintained privacy regarding details such as the second child's name and gender, consistent with her approach to shielding her family from public scrutiny.\n\nAfter Cy's birth, Lawrence openly discussed the difficulties of postpartum recovery, describing it as \"extremely isolating\" and noting sensations of feeling like \"an alien\" amid hormonal shifts and identity adjustments. She attributed some challenges to being left alone in unfamiliar settings, drawing parallels to her role in the 2025 film *Die My Love*, where her character grapples with postpartum psychosis. Despite these experiences, Lawrence reported a positive outlook on motherhood, stating it enhanced her creative perspective and advising fellow actors to have children for its transformative effects.\n\nIn managing her career alongside parenting two young children, Lawrence adopted a selective approach to projects, prioritizing family stability after years of intensive work that previously disrupted her equilibrium. By April 2025, sources described her as maintaining a \"great attitude\" while navigating the demands of a newborn and toddler, continuing promotional activities for films like *Die My Love* at events such as the Cannes Film Festival. This balance reflects her deliberate shift toward fewer acting commitments, supplemented by producing ventures, to accommodate family responsibilities without fully retreating from professional engagements.\n\n## Other ventures\n\n### Producing and business endeavors\n\nIn 2018, Jennifer Lawrence co-founded the production company Excellent Cadaver with producer Justine Polsky, establishing it as a vehicle for her expanded role behind the camera following her acting successes. The company, named after a term from forensic pathology referring to an ideal subject for autopsy study, secured an initial first-look film deal with Makeready, an independent studio, to develop and finance projects.\n\nExcellent Cadaver's early output included Lawrence serving as producer on *Causeway* (2022), a drama in which she also starred as a brain-injured veteran returning home; the film was directed by Lila Neugebauer and distributed by Apple TV+ after premiering at the Toronto International Film Festival. Lawrence next produced the R-rated comedy *No Hard Feelings* (2023), which she headlined as a cash-strapped woman hired to date a shy teenager; the Sony Pictures release grossed over $87 million worldwide against a $10 million budget.\n\nIn 2024, Lawrence executive produced the documentary *Zurawski v. Texas*, which chronicles Amanda Zurawski's legal challenge against Texas's abortion restrictions following life-threatening complications in her pregnancy; the film highlights empirical cases of medical delays due to legal fears among providers. Upcoming projects under Excellent Cadaver include *Die, My Love* (2025), a thriller adaptation directed by Lynne Ramsay in which Lawrence stars alongside Robert Pattinson, and *The Wives*, a murder mystery inspired by *The Real Housewives* franchise developed for Apple Original Films and A24. Lawrence has also attached as producer to *Bread \\u0026 Roses*, a documentary on Afghan women resisting Taliban rule post-2021 U.S. withdrawal.\n\nBeyond film production, Lawrence's business activities have centered on real estate investments, including purchases of properties in New York City and Beverly Hills valued collectively in the tens of millions, though these remain personal holdings rather than commercial ventures. No public records indicate involvement in non-entertainment enterprises such as consumer brands or equity stakes in unrelated industries.\n\n### Philanthropy and non-acting pursuits\n\nLawrence founded the Jennifer Lawrence Foundation in 2015 to support children's causes and the arts, including partnerships with the Boys \\u0026 Girls Clubs of America. \n\nIn February 2016, she donated $2 million to Norton Children's Hospital (formerly Kosair Children's Hospital) in her hometown of Louisville, Kentucky, establishing the Jennifer Lawrence Foundation Cardiac Intensive Care Unit; she challenged other donors to match contributions, ultimately raising over $4 million for the facility. \n\nThe foundation's efforts earned her the Association for Fundraising Professionals of Greater Louisville's Young Philanthropist of the Year award in 2019.\n\nShe has contributed to anti-hunger initiatives, including support for Feeding America and the World Food Programme.\n\nBeyond direct donations, Lawrence has engaged in public advocacy on issues affecting women in the entertainment industry and reproductive health services.\n\nIn an October 2015 essay for Lena Dunham's Lenny newsletter, she addressed Hollywood's gender pay disparity, citing leaked Sony emails from the 2014 hack that revealed she received lower compensation than male co-stars Christian Bale, Bradley Cooper, and Jeremy Renner for *American Hustle* (2013); Lawrence attributed her shortfall to reluctance in negotiations, fearing perceptions of being \"difficult\" or \"spoiled,\" unlike her male counterparts. \n\nIn January 2016 interviews, she defended Planned Parenthood amid congressional scrutiny over funding, recounting her own use of the organization's services as a teenager from a religious family for birth control and condoms, and arguing that defunding it would harm access to preventive care like Pap smears and cancer screenings beyond abortion services. \n\nFrom 2017 to 2018, Lawrence collaborated with the anti-corruption nonprofit Represent.us on grassroots efforts to mobilize young voters and reduce lobbying influence in politics, participating during acting hiatuses without fully pausing her career. \n\n## Filmography\n\n### Feature films\n\n| Year | Title | Role |\n|------|-------|------|\n| 2008 | The Burning Plain | Young Mariana |\n| 2008 | The Poker House | Agnes |\n| 2008 | Garden Party | Tiffany |\n| 2010 | Winter's Bone | Ree Dolly |\n| 2011 | Like Crazy | Sam |\n| 2011 | X-Men: First Class | Raven Darkhölme / Mystique |\n| 2012 | The Hunger Games | Katniss Everdeen |\n| 2012 | Silver Linings Playbook | Tiffany Maxwell |\n| 2012 | House at the End of the Street | Elissa Testwuide |\n| 2013 | American Hustle | Rosalyn Rosenfeld |\n| 2013 | The Hunger Games: Catching Fire | Katniss Everdeen |\n| 2014 | X-Men: Days of Future Past | Raven Darkhölme / Mystique |\n| 2014 | The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1 | Katniss Everdeen |\n| 2014 | Dumb and Dumber To | Penny (cameo) |\n| 2015 | Serena | Serena Pemberton |\n| 2015 | Joy | Joy Mangano |\n| 2015 | The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2 | Katniss Everdeen |\n| 2016 | X-Men: Apocalypse | Raven Darkhölme / Mystique |\n| 2016 | Passengers | Aurora Lane |\n| 2017 | mother! | Mother |\n| 2018 | Red Sparrow | Dominika Egorova |\n| 2019 | Dark Phoenix | Raven Darkhölme / Mystique |\n| 2021 | Don't Look Up | Dr. Kate Dibiasky |\n| 2022 | Causeway | Lynzee |\n| 2023 | No Hard Feelings | Maddie Barker |\n\n### Television appearances\n\nLawrence's early acting career included guest roles on several scripted television series. In 2006, she portrayed Maudie Pruitt, a mascot involved in a murder mystery, in the fifth-season episode \"Mr. Monk and the Big Game\" of the USA Network series *Monk*, which aired on August 4. In 2007, she appeared as Debbie Skaggs, a troubled teen, in the fourth-season episode \"A Dollar, A Dream\" of CBS's *Cold Case*, broadcast on March 25, and as Meredith, a rebellious daughter, in the third-season episode \"Mother's Little Helper\" of NBC's *Medium*, aired on November 6.\n\nHer breakthrough television role came as a series regular in the TBS sitcom *The Bill Engvall Show*, where she played Lauren Pearson, the sarcastic eldest daughter of a family counseling psychologist, from the series premiere on July 17, 2007, through its conclusion on September 5, 2009, across three seasons comprising 30 episodes.\n\nLawrence hosted *Saturday Night Live* on January 19, 2013, during its 38th season, participating in sketches such as a *Hunger Games* parody and a musical number, with musical guest The Lumineers.\n\n| Year(s) | Title                  | Role              | Notes                          |\n|---------|------------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------|\n| 2006   | *Monk*                | Maudie Pruitt    | Guest role; Season 5, Episode 3 |\n| 2007   | *Cold Case*           | Debbie Skaggs    | Guest role; Season 4, Episode 18 |\n| 2007   | *Medium*              | Meredith         | Guest role; Season 3, Episode 7 |\n| 2007–2009 | *The Bill Engvall Show* | Lauren Pearson | Main role; 30 episodes        |\n| 2013   | *Saturday Night Live* | Herself (host)   | Season 38, Episode 11         |\n\n### Music videos and other media\n\nLawrence appeared as herself in the music video for \"The Mess I Made\" by the American rock band Parachute, released in 2009 as part of promotion for their debut album *Losing My Mind*. The video, directed by Stephen Milburn Anderson, features Lawrence in a brief non-speaking role walking through urban settings, marking one of her early on-camera appearances before her breakthrough in *Winter's Bone* (2010).\n\nIn addition to music videos, Lawrence has featured in various commercial advertisements, notably as the global ambassador for Christian Dior since 2012. She starred in video campaigns for Dior's fashion lines and fragrances, including a 2023 commercial filmed in New York City that incorporated elements like dogs to highlight the brand's luxury aesthetic. These endorsements, often showcasing her in elegant attire against sophisticated backdrops, have been credited with boosting Dior's visibility among younger audiences.\n\nLawrence filmed an uncredited cameo for the comedy film *Dumb and Dumber To* (2014), portraying a character interacting with the protagonists Harry and Lloyd, but the scene was ultimately cut from the final release at her request due to concerns over the final edit's quality.\n\n## Awards and nominations\n\nJennifer Lawrence has received numerous accolades throughout her career, including one Academy Award, one BAFTA Award, and three Golden Globe Awards for her performances in films directed by David O. Russell.\n\n| Year | Award | Category | Nominated work | Result |\n|------|-------|----------|----------------|--------|\n| 2011 | Academy Awards | Best Actress | Winter's Bone | Nominated |\n| 2013 | Academy Awards | Best Actress | Silver Linings Playbook | Won |\n| 2013 | Golden Globe Awards | Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical | Silver Linings Playbook | Won |\n| 2013 | Screen Actors Guild Awards | Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role | Silver Linings Playbook | Won |\n| 2013 | BAFTA Awards | Best Actress in a Leading Role | Silver Linings Playbook | Nominated |\n| 2014 | Academy Awards | Best Supporting Actress | American Hustle | Nominated |\n| 2014 | Golden Globe Awards | Best Supporting Actress – Motion Picture | American Hustle | Won |\n| 2014 | BAFTA Awards | Best Actress in a Supporting Role | American Hustle | Won |\n| 2016 | Academy Awards | Best Actress | Joy | Nominated |\n| 2016 | Golden Globe Awards | Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical | Joy | Won",
