# Margot Robbie

Margot Elise Robbie (born 2 July 1990) is an Australian actress and producer.  
Robbie began her career in Australian television, appearing as Donna Freedman on the soap opera *Neighbours* from 2008 to 2011, before transitioning to film with a supporting role in *I.C.U.* (2009). Her international breakthrough came with the role of Naomi Lapaglia in Martin Scorsese's *The Wolf of Wall Street* (2013), which showcased her ability to command attention in ensemble casts.  
She gained further prominence portraying Harley Quinn in the DC Extended Universe, starting with *Suicide Squad* (2016), and earned critical acclaim for lead roles in *I, Tonya* (2017), for which she received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress, and *Bombshell* (2019), earning a Best Supporting Actress nomination. In addition to acting, Robbie co-founded LuckyChap Entertainment in 2014 with her husband Tom Ackerley and business partners, focusing on female-centric narratives; the company produced the commercially successful *Barbie* (2023), in which she starred and for which she received a Best Picture nomination as producer.

## Early life

### Family background and childhood

Margot Robbie was born Margot Elise Robbie on July 2, 1990, in Dalby, Queensland, Australia, the third of four children born to Sarie Kessler, a physiotherapist, and Doug Robbie, a former farm owner. Her siblings include older brother Lachlan, younger brother Cameron, and sister Anya.

Robbie's parents separated when she was five years old, after which she and her siblings were raised primarily by their mother in the Gold Coast region of Queensland. The family spent much of Robbie's early years on her grandparents' farm in the Currumbin Valley hinterland near the Gold Coast, where she developed an affinity for rural life amid sugarcane fields and coastal proximity.

During her childhood, Robbie frequently visited her father's properties in Dalby and contributed to farm tasks, reflecting the practical, self-reliant environment of her upbringing, though specific details on her daily routines remain limited in public accounts. Her early experiences on the farm and in the Gold Coast area instilled a grounded perspective, as she later described balancing rural simplicity with suburban influences before pursuing opportunities beyond Queensland in her late teens.

### Education and initial career aspirations

Robbie attended Somerset College, an independent high school in Mudgeeraba, Queensland, where she focused on drama studies during her secondary education. She graduated from the institution in 2007. There is no record of her pursuing formal higher education or university attendance following high school, as she instead prioritized professional acting opportunities.

From an early age, Robbie demonstrated interest in performance arts, including enrollment in a local circus school where she earned a certificate in trapeze by age eight, reflecting an initial draw toward physical and theatrical spectacles like magic or acrobatics. By high school, her aspirations shifted toward acting, influenced by participation in school plays and drama classes that honed her skills in independent films and stage work. To fund her relocation to Melbourne for auditions, she held multiple part-time jobs as a teenager, including bartending, house cleaning, and sandwich preparation at Subway, saving approximately AUD 1,000 by age 17. This self-funded move in 2007 directly led to her casting in the soap opera *Neighbours* in 2008, marking the transition from educational pursuits to a committed acting career without further academic detours.

## Acting career

### Early television roles (2008–2012)

Robbie's professional acting career began in 2008 with her casting as Donna Freedman in the Australian soap opera *Neighbours*, a role that marked her television debut. Introduced in episode 5531, aired on 23 June 2008, Donna was depicted as an orphaned teenager and obsessive fan of musician Ty Harper (Dean Geyer), initially arriving in the fictional suburb of Erinsborough as a short-term guest character. Due to positive audience reception, the role was expanded into a series regular, with Freedman integrating into Ramsay Street storylines involving foster family dynamics, romantic entanglements, school challenges, and a fashion internship arc.

She portrayed Donna continuously until episode 6071, broadcast on 7 January 2011, spanning over 500 episodes and encompassing plots such as elopements, legal troubles, and personal growth amid the soap's ensemble format. For her performance, Robbie earned two Logie Award nominations: Most Popular New Female Talent in 2009 and Most Popular Actress in 2010, reflecting recognition within Australian television circles despite the genre's formulaic constraints.

Following her *Neighbours* tenure, Robbie relocated to Los Angeles in 2011 to pursue Hollywood opportunities, securing the recurring role of Laura Cameron in the ABC drama *Pan Am*. Premiering on 25 September 2011, the series followed the professional and personal lives of Pan American World Airways flight attendants in the early 1960s, with Robbie playing the idealistic younger sister of lead character Kate Cameron (Christina Ricci), appearing in seven of the 14 episodes produced. *Pan Am* concluded after one season on 19 February 2012 due to insufficient ratings, limiting Robbie's exposure but providing her initial foothold in U.S. network television.

### Breakthrough films (2013–2015)

Robbie achieved her breakthrough in Hollywood with the role of Naomi Lapaglia, the second wife of stockbroker Jordan Belfort, in Martin Scorsese's black comedy *The Wolf of Wall Street* (2013), co-starring Leonardo DiCaprio. Her performance as the sharp-tongued, ambitious character earned her a nomination for MTV Movie Award for Best Breakthrough Performance. The film, which depicted the excesses of Wall Street in the late 1980s and early 1990s, received widespread critical acclaim for its direction, screenplay, and ensemble cast, with Robbie's portrayal noted for its blend of allure and assertiveness.

Prior to *The Wolf of Wall Street*, Robbie appeared in a supporting role as Charlotte in the romantic comedy *About Time* (2013), directed by Richard Curtis, which explored time travel and family dynamics but did not significantly elevate her profile internationally. In 2014, she starred as April in the action fantasy *I, Frankenstein*, a commercial underperformer that grossed $97 million worldwide against a $30 million budget but received poor reviews for its script and effects.

In 2015, Robbie co-led the con artist thriller *Focus* opposite Will Smith, playing Jess Barrett, a novice grifter mentored by Smith's experienced Nicky Spurgeon. The film earned mixed reviews, holding a 55% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 227 critics' assessments, with praise directed at the leads' chemistry and tense cons but criticism for predictable plotting. Financially, *Focus* succeeded with a worldwide gross of $159.1 million on a $50-65 million budget. That year, she also featured in a memorable cameo in *The Big Short*, directed by Adam McKay, where her character explained mortgage-backed securities while lounging in a bubble bath, serving as a narrative device to simplify financial jargon for audiences. These roles solidified Robbie's transition from television to leading film parts, showcasing her versatility in comedy, drama, and action genres.

### Global stardom and franchise roles (2016–2018)

In 2016, Margot Robbie attained global stardom through prominent roles in high-profile action-adventure and superhero films. She starred as Jane Clayton opposite Alexander Skarsgård's Tarzan in *The Legend of Tarzan*, directed by David Yates, which earned $357.2 million worldwide on a $180 million production budget, marking a solid commercial performance despite mixed critical reception. That year, Robbie's portrayal of psychiatrist-turned-villain Harley Quinn (Dr. Harleen Quinzel) in David Ayer's *Suicide Squad*, the third installment in the DC Extended Universe, further elevated her profile; the film grossed $749.2 million globally against a $175 million budget, becoming one of the year's top earners. Her energetic, chaotic depiction of Harley Quinn—emphasizing the character's mania, combat skills, and twisted romance with the Joker—emerged as the production's critical and audience highlight amid broader complaints about pacing and editing, propelling Quinn's cultural visibility and Robbie's appeal to international audiences. Robbie was subsequently named IMDb's most-searched star of 2016, reflecting the role's impact on her fame.

The Harley Quinn character, originally a Batman sidekick from 1990s comics, saw renewed profitability through Robbie's live-action interpretation, which influenced merchandise sales, cosplay trends, and spin-off considerations within the DC franchise. Despite controversies, including fan backlash over the character's abusive dynamics with the Joker leading to reported death threats against Robbie, the performance solidified her as a versatile lead capable of anchoring blockbuster ensembles.

In 2018, Robbie expanded into voice acting with franchise properties, voicing Flopsy Rabbit and serving as narrator in *Peter Rabbit*, a live-action/animated adaptation of Beatrix Potter's tales directed by Will Gluck, which generated $351.5 million worldwide on a $50 million budget and spawned sequels.) This role leveraged her established draw in family-oriented content, contributing to the film's appeal through her spirited delivery amid a cast including James Corden and Domhnall Gleeson. Concurrently, she took supporting turns in non-franchise projects like the thriller *Terminal* and as Queen Elizabeth I in *Mary Queen of Scots*, but these did not match the scale of her prior franchise breakthroughs. By late 2018, Robbie's franchise associations—particularly via Harley Quinn—had cemented her status as a bankable star, with *Suicide Squad*'s enduring metrics underscoring its role in her transition from supporting actress to global lead.

### Mature roles and recent projects (2019–present)

In 2019, Robbie portrayed Sharon Tate in Quentin Tarantino's *Once Upon a Time in Hollywood*, depicting the actress's final months before her murder by members of the Manson Family. Her performance emphasized Tate's vivacity and resemblance to the real figure, though critics noted the role's limited screen time and dialogue, which Tarantino defended as intentional to humanize the victim without exploitation.  

That same year, Robbie played Kayla Pospisil, a fictionalized junior producer enduring sexual harassment at Fox News, in *Bombshell*, a dramatization of the Roger Ailes scandal. The role highlighted workplace power imbalances and the #MeToo movement's early dynamics, drawing from accounts of real employees while avoiding direct composites for legal reasons. The film grossed $61.4 million worldwide against a $32 million budget.  

Robbie reprised her role as Harley Quinn in *Birds of Prey* (2020) and *The Suicide Squad* (2021), the latter directed by James Gunn and praised for its violent action sequences and character arcs, including Quinn's escape from prison using improvised weapons. These DC films marked a shift toward ensemble dynamics but retained the character's chaotic persona from earlier portrayals. *The Suicide Squad* earned a 90% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes.  

In 2022, Robbie starred as Nellie LaRoy, a volatile aspiring actress navigating the debauchery of early Hollywood's transition from silent films to talkies, in Damien Chazelle's *Babylon*. Her energetic, unfiltered performance amid scenes of excess—including drug use and orgies—was lauded for capturing the era's hedonism, though the film's bombastic style divided audiences. Later that year, she appeared in Wes Anderson's *Amsterdam* as a nurse entangled in a 1930s conspiracy.  

Robbie's portrayal of the titular doll in Greta Gerwig's *Barbie* (2023) combined satire with existential themes, grossing $1.447 billion worldwide and becoming the highest-earning film of the year. The project, co-produced by her company LuckyChap Entertainment, won the inaugural Golden Globe for Cinematic and Box Office Achievement.  

In 2025, Robbie led *A Big Bold Beautiful Journey* opposite Colin Farrell, playing Sarah, a woman who embarks on a magical road trip with a stranger after meeting at a wedding, guided by a fantastical GPS. Directed by Kogonada, the romantic fantasy received mixed reviews for its metaphorical exploration of relationships but underperformed commercially, opening to $3.5 million domestically.

## Producing and business ventures

### Establishment of LuckyChap Entertainment

LuckyChap Entertainment was co-founded in 2014 by Australian actress Margot Robbie, her then-partner Tom Ackerley, childhood friend Sophia Kerr, and production assistant Josey McNamara, with the explicit aim of producing films and content centered on female-driven narratives and supporting emerging women filmmakers. The company's formation stemmed from the founders' shared experiences in the male-dominated film industry, where Robbie and her collaborators sought greater control over storytelling that prioritized authentic female perspectives, as articulated by Robbie in subsequent interviews reflecting on early motivations.

The entity was formally incorporated as LuckyChap Entertainment Limited on September 18, 2014, in Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, United Kingdom, initially operating from a shared London home that served as an informal headquarters for the nascent venture. Headquartered primarily in Los Angeles, California, with dual British-American operations, the company focused from inception on independent projects rather than blockbuster pursuits, emphasizing scripts that passed an internal "F*** yes" test for creative passion over commercial viability alone. This bootstrapped approach allowed for agile development of early slate items, drawing on Robbie's rising post-*Wolf of Wall Street* profile to secure initial partnerships without external funding rounds at launch.

### Notable productions and commercial outcomes

LuckyChap Entertainment's debut feature, *I, Tonya* (2017), achieved commercial viability as an independent production, grossing $53.9 million worldwide against an estimated $11 million budget. The film's success stemmed from critical acclaim and awards nominations, including an Academy Award for Best Actress for Robbie, enabling LuckyChap to secure further financing for female-led stories.

Subsequent releases included *Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn)* (2020), which earned $205.3 million globally on a reported budget of $84.5–100 million, recouping costs through domestic and international markets despite pandemic disruptions. *Promising Young Woman* (2020), a lower-budget thriller, generated $18.9 million in box office revenue, bolstered by Oscar wins for Best Original Screenplay and supporting its direct-to-video profitability model amid theater closures.

The company's most significant financial triumph came with *Barbie* (2023), co-produced with Warner Bros., which amassed over $1.4 billion worldwide, marking the highest-grossing film of the year and yielding substantial backend earnings for LuckyChap, including approximately $50 million in salary and bonuses for Robbie as producer. This performance, driven by broad audience appeal and merchandising tie-ins, elevated LuckyChap's portfolio value, leading to expanded deals such as a first-look agreement with Warner Bros.

| Film                  | Release Year | Worldwide Gross (USD) | Estimated Budget (USD) |
|-----------------------|--------------|-----------------------|------------------------|
| I, Tonya             | 2017        | 53.9 million         | 11 million            |
| Birds of Prey        | 2020        | 205.3 million        | 84.5–100 million      |
| Promising Young Woman| 2020        | 18.9 million         | Not publicly detailed |
| Barbie               | 2023        | 1.4 billion+         | 145 million           |

## Personal life

### Relationships and marriage

Margot Robbie met Tom Ackerley in 2013 on the set of the film *Suite Française*, where she portrayed a supporting character and he served as third assistant director. Initially, their interaction developed into a platonic friendship; the pair later became housemates in London alongside other industry colleagues, including Ackerley's assistant director sibling.

The friendship transitioned into a romantic relationship in the years following their initial meeting, though exact dating timelines remain private. Robbie and Ackerley married in a private ceremony on December 19, 2016, at a rural estate in Byron Bay, Australia, attended by close family and friends; the event was kept secret from the public until later confirmed by Robbie. No public engagement announcement preceded the wedding.

Since their marriage, Robbie and Ackerley have collaborated professionally, including co-founding the production company LuckyChap Entertainment in 2018 with Robbie's childhood friends. In a 2024 interview, Robbie described their dynamic as involving near-constant togetherness outside of work, attributing the strength of their partnership to shared professional routines and mutual support. The couple has maintained a low public profile regarding their personal life, with no confirmed reports of children as of 2025. Prior to Ackerley, Robbie's romantic history includes unconfirmed rumors of involvement with co-stars such as Alexander Skarsgård during the 2016 production of *The Legend of Tarzan*, but no verified long-term relationships have been documented.

### Lifestyle and residences

Margot Robbie primarily resides in Los Angeles, California, with her husband, Tom Ackerley, in a private home described as a familial sanctuary featuring modern interiors. The couple, who met on the set of *Suite Française* in 2013 and married in 2016, previously shared a modest house in Clapham, southwest London, during their early relationship. Robbie has invested in multiple properties, including sales and renovations in Los Angeles and on Australia's Gold Coast, where her family remains based; her portfolio emphasizes California-style modern beach house aesthetics with features like ocean views and lush gardens.  In Queensland, she once rented a $4.9 million retreat with a guest shed, cedar hot tub, barrel sauna, and wraparound porch, though it was a former residence.

Robbie's lifestyle lacks a fixed daily routine, adapting instead to her acting and producing commitments, such as filming in locations like Budapest. She favors casual indulgences including beers, fries, and burgers but shifts to restrictive eating—like carrot sticks—for role preparations involving swimwear. Fitness emphasizes strength training, reformer Pilates, heavy lower-body lifts (back squats, deadlifts, leg presses), and occasional skating or dance cardio, often 4–5 sessions weekly when prepping for physically demanding parts like *Barbie*.  A self-described tea enthusiast, she consumes about 10 cups daily, viewing it as a remedy for various needs. During periods like the 2020 lockdowns, she incorporated home dancing to high-energy music for mental and physical release.

## Public image and reception

### Accolades and critical assessment

Margot Robbie has garnered significant recognition for her performances and producing work, including nominations for three Academy Awards: Best Actress for portraying Tonya Harding in *I, Tonya* (2017) at the 90th ceremony on March 4, 2018; Best Supporting Actress for her role in *Bombshell* (2019) at the 92nd on February 9, 2020; and Best Picture as a producer of *Barbie* (2023) at the 96th on March 10, 2024. She has also received four Golden Globe Award nominations, including Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy for *Barbie* at the 81st ceremony on January 7, 2024, and Best Actress for *I, Tonya* at the 75th on January 7, 2018, though she has not won in the acting categories. Additional honors include two Critics' Choice Movie Award wins—for Best Actress in a Comedy for *I, Tonya* in 2018 and Best Actress in a Comedy for *Barbie* in 2024—and nominations from the Screen Actors Guild for *Bombshell* and *Barbie*.

Critics have lauded Robbie's ability to embody complex characters in biographical roles, particularly her portrayal of Tonya Harding, which reviewers described as capturing the skater's resilience amid personal turmoil and media scrutiny, contributing to the film's 90% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 374 reviews. Her performance in *Bombshell* drew praise for depicting Kayla, a composite Fox News staffer, with nuance that highlighted institutional power dynamics, earning a nomination from the Hollywood Foreign Press Association despite the ensemble nature of the cast. In contrast, her franchise roles, such as Harley Quinn in the DC Extended Universe films starting with *Suicide Squad* (2016), have been commercially successful—*Birds of Prey* (2020) grossed $205 million worldwide—but received mixed critical feedback for prioritizing spectacle over character depth, with some outlets noting her charisma sustains the portrayal amid uneven scripting.

As a producer, Robbie's oversight of *Barbie*, which earned $1.44 billion globally and became Warner Bros.' highest-grossing film, underscores her commercial acumen, though its Best Picture nomination reflected ensemble and directorial elements more than her individual acting, which aggregated 88% positive reviews on Metacritic from 62 critics for its satirical take on consumerism and identity. Assessments of her overall career highlight versatility across genres, from indie dramas to blockbusters, yet note a reliance on physical appeal in early roles like *The Wolf of Wall Street* (2013), where her scenes as Naomi Lapaglia generated buzz but sparked debates on objectification versus performance merit. Independent analyses, such as rankings by *The Hollywood Reporter*, position *I, Tonya* and *Once Upon a Time in Hollywood* (2019) among her strongest, crediting her for elevating material through preparation and range, while acknowledging that mainstream media outlets sometimes amplify her appeal over rigorous scrutiny of acting technique.

### Cultural influence and media depictions

Robbie's portrayal of Harley Quinn beginning with *Suicide Squad* (2016) propelled the character from comic book obscurity to a enduring pop culture staple, marked by widespread cosplay, merchandise sales exceeding $1 billion annually for DC properties featuring the character, and influences on fashion trends like pigtails and baseball bats. Her interpretation emphasized Quinn's psychological complexity and anti-heroine independence, diverging from prior animated depictions and inspiring spin-offs like *Birds of Prey* (2020), which grossed $205 million despite mixed reviews.

The 2023 *Barbie* film, starring and co-produced by Robbie, achieved $1.445 billion in worldwide box office receipts, the highest-grossing film of the year and directed by a woman, while igniting "Barbenheimer"—a simultaneous release phenomenon with *Oppenheimer* that drove $240 million in joint U.S. opening weekend ticket sales. It spurred "Barbiecore" aesthetics, with global pink clothing sales surging 21% in July 2023 per Nielsen data, and prompted debates on consumerism and femininity without resolving them empirically. Robbie's performance, blending satire and earnestness, contributed to her $59 million pretax earnings that year, ranking her second among actors per Forbes.

In 2017, Time magazine included Robbie in its 100 most influential people list, with Martin Scorsese citing her "old-school charisma" from *The Wolf of Wall Street* (2013). Her roles have influenced luxury brand endorsements, including Chanel campaigns since 2018 that generated millions in media value.

Media portrayals frequently frame Robbie as a modern blonde archetype akin to Marilyn Monroe, emphasizing physical allure in early coverage—like a 2016 Vanity Fair article derided for objectification via staged interviews—but evolving to acclaim her producer role in female-led narratives. Outlets such as Business of Fashion note her as a style influencer, with *Barbie* press amplifying her as a commercial force rather than mere icon.

## Controversies and criticisms

### Professional and project-related backlash

The 2023 film *Barbie*, produced by Robbie's company LuckyChap Entertainment and starring Robbie as the titular character, faced significant criticism from conservative commentators and audiences for its portrayal of patriarchal structures and feminist themes, with detractors arguing it promoted anti-male narratives under a family-friendly veneer. Figures such as Ben Shapiro publicly dismissed the film's premise during its promotional tour, highlighting perceived inconsistencies in its gender politics, which amplified online debates and contributed to polarized reception despite its $1.4 billion global box office gross. This backlash echoed in international markets, including China, where state media and online users labeled it as divisive propaganda exacerbating gender tensions.

Robbie's starring role and producing credit in *Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn)* (2020), another LuckyChap project, drew scrutiny for its R-rated violence, profanity, and emphasis on female-led action, which some critics and audiences viewed as pandering to empowerment tropes at the expense of coherent storytelling. The film underperformed commercially, earning $205 million worldwide against a $85 million budget, with analysts attributing part of the shortfall to audience aversion toward its "girl power" marketing and title adjustments aimed at clarifying the Harley Quinn focus amid perceived disinterest in ensemble female superhero narratives. Reviews highlighted Robbie's energetic performance but faulted the script's reliance on chaotic aesthetics over substantive character development.

Subsequent projects amplified commercial pressures on Robbie and LuckyChap, including the 2022 film *Babylon*, where Robbie's involvement was linked to its domestic box office disappointment of $15 million against a $80 million budget, prompting accusations of her selective project choices contributing to financial risks for studios. Additionally, her decision to star in a David O. Russell-directed film despite prior allegations of abusive on-set behavior against the director drew fan criticism for prioritizing career opportunities over ethical consistency. In 2025, announcements of Robbie starring as Catherine Earnshaw in Emerald Fennell's *Wuthering Heights* adaptation sparked backlash over casting an Australian actress in a role tied to English moorland heritage, with detractors questioning historical and cultural fidelity.

### Personal and ideological scrutiny

Margot Robbie has maintained a relatively private stance on explicit political ideologies, with public statements limited to support for workers' rights and initiatives addressing workplace harassment. In a 2023 interview clip shared by Trades Union Congress materials, she emphasized the importance of unions in protecting employees from exploitation, stating that collective bargaining provides essential leverage against corporate overreach. This pro-union position aligns with labor advocacy common in the entertainment industry but has drawn little controversy, as it reflects practical concerns over economic precarity rather than broader ideological commitments. Robbie has not disclosed donations to political parties or candidates, focusing instead on non-partisan charities such as Oxfam and Australian bushfire relief efforts, where she urged fans to contribute to firefighting and wildlife services during the 2019-2020 crisis.

In 2018, Robbie endorsed the Time's Up campaign, pledging support for efforts to combat sexual harassment and discrimination, particularly in Hollywood following #MeToo revelations. Despite this alignment with progressive-leaning reforms, she has acknowledged a personal disconnect from the experiences depicted in related projects; preparing for her role in the 2019 film *Bombshell*, Robbie reported never having encountered workplace sexual harassment herself, though the production prompted her to reconsider subtler forms of misconduct. This admission highlights a gap between her advocacy and lived experience, potentially underscoring selective engagement with feminist causes amid industry pressures, where such endorsements often serve reputational rather than deeply causal purposes. Her research for *Bombshell* involved creating a pseudonymous Twitter account to follow young conservative women, whom she described as inhabiting a "totally different planet" from her own worldview, suggesting an implicit liberal-leaning perspective shaped by Australian roots and Hollywood norms rather than rigorous ideological scrutiny.

Personal life events have occasionally invited ideological projection, though Robbie avoids direct engagement. Following the November 2024 birth of her son, scattered online commentary from self-described feminists expressed disappointment over the child's gender, tying it absurdly to her *Barbie* role and implying a failure to advance "girl power" narratives; these reactions, amplified on platforms like Reddit and YouTube, reveal fringe expectations but lack substantive evidence of Robbie's own views on family or reproductive issues, as she has not publicly addressed abortion, gender roles, or parenting philosophies. Such scrutiny often stems from media's amplification of celebrity personal milestones, where empirical personal choices—like opting for privacy in family matters—clash with imposed ideological lenses from biased online echo chambers, yet Robbie's reticence prevents verifiable deeper analysis.
