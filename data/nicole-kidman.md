## Early life

### Family background and childhood

Nicole Mary Kidman was born on June 20, 1967, in Honolulu, Hawaii, to Australian parents Antony David Kidman, a biochemist and clinical psychologist, and Janelle Ann Kidman (née Glenny), a nursing instructor.  Her father's temporary presence in the United States stemmed from a biochemistry scholarship and student visa, prompting the family's relocation back to Australia soon after her birth. 

The Kidmans settled in Sydney, New South Wales, where Nicole grew up with her younger sister, Antonia, born in 1970; the sisters remain close, with Antonia pursuing a career in journalism and television presenting.  Antony and Janelle, who married in 1963, emphasized education and professional pursuits, with Antony later specializing in clinical psychology and Janelle in nursing education.  Kidman's early years in Sydney's northern suburbs involved typical childhood activities, though she later recalled a focus on family and personal development amid her parents' academic commitments.

By age five, the family had fully established roots in Sydney, shaping Kidman's Australian identity despite her U.S. birthplace; she holds dual Australian-American citizenship by descent.  Her upbringing reflected her parents' middle-class professional milieu, with no reported financial hardships, fostering an environment conducive to her emerging interests in performance.

### Initial acting training and debut

Kidman first expressed interest in performing arts during her childhood in Sydney, studying drama and ballet from a young age. She later enrolled in acting classes at the Phillip Street Theatre, committing to weekend sessions while attending high school. Following three years of training at Phillip Street, she joined the Australian Theatre for Young People, which provided early industry exposure through stage performances.

At age 16, Kidman withdrew from North Sydney Girls High School to focus on acting professionally. Her screen debut occurred that year in the Australian family film *Bush Christmas* (1983), a remake of a 1947 holiday classic where she played a supporting role as one of the children tracking stolen horses.

This led to immediate further opportunities in Australia, including the lead role of Judy in the adventure film *BMX Bandits* (1983), portraying a teenager involved in a bank robbery scheme using bicycles, and guest appearances as Annie in the television western series *Five Mile Creek* (1983). These early projects established her presence in Australian media, emphasizing youthful, action-oriented characters suited to her age and emerging skills.

## Film and television career

### Australian films and early roles (1983–1989)

Kidman made her film debut at the age of 16 in the Australian outback drama *Bush Christmas* (1983), directed by Henri Safran, portraying Helen Thompson, a young girl who joins her siblings in pursuing horse thieves during the holiday season to save the family farm. The film, a remake of a 1947 production, was shot in Queensland and emphasized themes of rural Australian resilience amid economic hardship. Later that year, she took a leading role as Judy in *BMX Bandits* (1983), a low-budget action-comedy directed by Brian Trenchard-Smith, in which a group of Sydney teenagers, including Kidman riding BMX bicycles, discovers stolen walkie-talkies and battles a criminal gang planning a bank heist. The production, filmed on location in New South Wales, highlighted Kidman's athleticism in stunt sequences and marked her first prominent screen presence in a youth-oriented adventure.

In the mid-1980s, Kidman continued building her profile through supporting roles in Australian television and film, including appearances in the Western series *Five Mile Creek* (1983–1985), where she played a recurring character in the outback-set drama. She starred as Pearl, a free-spirited surfer, opposite actor Tom Burlinson in the romantic drama *Windrider* (1986), directed by Vincent Monton, depicting a small-town engineer's invention of a high-speed windsurfing board and his pursuit of an unattainable beach girl. This role showcased her in a more sensual, coming-of-age context amid coastal Australian settings. By 1988, she appeared in Colin Higgins' satirical comedy *Emerald City*, portraying a young woman navigating the cutthroat world of Sydney's literary scene, which critiqued the city's shift from cultural backwater to cosmopolitan hub.

Kidman's breakthrough in Australian cinema arrived with the psychological thriller *Dead Calm* (1989), directed by Phillip Noyce and produced by George Miller, where she played Rae Ingram opposite Sam Neill as her husband John, a couple grieving their son's death on a yachting voyage interrupted by a deranged survivor (Billy Zane) from a wrecked ship. Filmed primarily at sea off the Great Barrier Reef, the film demanded intense physical and emotional performances from Kidman, including underwater sequences, and its tense cat-and-mouse narrative drew international distributor interest from Warner Bros., propelling her toward Hollywood opportunities. The production's completion in 1988, with a U.S. release in 1989, underscored her transition from local ingenue to versatile lead capable of anchoring high-stakes suspense.

### Hollywood breakthrough and collaborations (1990–2001)

Kidman's entry into Hollywood occurred with her role as neurosurgeon Dr. Claire Lewicki in the action sports drama *Days of Thunder* (1990), directed by Tony Scott and starring Tom Cruise as NASCAR driver Cole Trickle; the film, produced by Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, grossed $157.9 million worldwide against a $60 million budget despite mixed critical reception. She met Cruise during filming in 1989, and the pair married on December 24, 1990, in Telluride, Colorado, a union that lasted until their divorce was finalized on August 8, 2001. Their marriage facilitated several professional collaborations, including the epic romantic western *Far and Away* (1992), directed by Ron Howard, where Kidman played Irish immigrant Shannon Christie alongside Cruise's Joseph Donnelly; the film earned $137.8 million globally but received lukewarm reviews for its scripting.

In the mid-1990s, Kidman diversified her roles with supporting parts in *Batman Forever* (1995), portraying psychologist Dr. Chase Meridian in Joel Schumacher's superhero film opposite Val Kilmer's Batman, which grossed $336.6 million worldwide and marked a commercial hit amid her efforts to expand beyond romantic leads. Her critical breakthrough came with the lead in Gus Van Sant's black comedy *To Die For* (1995), as ambitious weather reporter Suzanne Stone who manipulates others to murder her husband; the film, adapted from Joyce Maynard's novel and co-starring Matt Dillon and Joaquin Phoenix, premiered at Cannes and earned Kidman a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy, with critics praising her satirical portrayal of media obsession. Subsequent projects included the action thriller *The Peacemaker* (1997), directed by Mimi Leder, where she starred as nuclear expert Dr. Julia Kelly opposite George Clooney, grossing $110.5 million but drawing criticism for formulaic plotting.

Kidman collaborated again with Cruise in Stanley Kubrick's psychological drama *Eyes Wide Shut* (1999), playing Alice Harford in a story of marital infidelity and erotic intrigue adapted from Arthur Schnitzler's novella; the production, Kubrick's final film, spanned 15 months of shooting and released posthumously on July 16, 1999, earning $162.1 million worldwide amid debates over its thematic depth and digital alterations for U.S. release. In 2001, she headlined the supernatural horror *The Others*, directed by Alejandro Amenábar, as mother Grace Stewart protecting her photosensitive children in a isolated mansion; the Spanish-U.S. co-production grossed $209.2 million on a $17 million budget, showcasing Kidman's ability to anchor tense atmospheric narratives. That year also saw her in Baz Luhrmann's musical *Moulin Rouge!*, portraying cabaret star Satine in a tragic romance with Ewan McGregor's Christian; the film, featuring original pop medleys and earning eight Oscar nominations including one for Kidman's performance, grossed $179.8 million and highlighted her vocal and dance capabilities despite a knee injury during production. These roles solidified her transition from supporting actress to versatile leading talent, blending commercial appeal with artistic risks.

### Critical successes and Oscar win (2002–2009)

Kidman received critical acclaim for her portrayal of Virginia Woolf in *The Hours* (2002), directed by Stephen Daldry, where she depicted the author's struggles with mental illness alongside Julianne Moore and Meryl Streep. Her performance, involving a prosthetic nose to alter her appearance, was praised for its emotional depth and earned her the Academy Award for Best Actress at the 75th Academy Awards on March 23, 2003, marking her sole competitive Oscar win to date. The film itself garnered nine Oscar nominations, including Best Picture, and a 71% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 207 reviews.

Following her Oscar victory, Kidman starred in Lars von Trier's experimental drama *Dogville* (2003), playing Grace, a fugitive seeking refuge in a Depression-era American town, which exposed themes of exploitation and morality. The film's minimalist set and Brechtian style divided audiences at Cannes, with some American critics decrying its portrayal of U.S. society, yet Kidman's restrained yet intense performance was highlighted as a standout in the ensemble. It holds a 71% Rotten Tomatoes score from 170 reviews, reflecting its polarizing reception.

In 2004, Kidman led *Birth*, directed by Jonathan Glazer, as Anna, a widow confronted by a 10-year-old boy claiming to be her deceased husband's reincarnation, blending psychological thriller elements with themes of grief and obsession. Roger Ebert awarded it 3.5 out of 4 stars, commending Kidman's "fragile yet magnetic" portrayal amid the film's atmospheric tension, though it received mixed reviews overall with a 41% Rotten Tomatoes rating from 148 critics. The role showcased her willingness to tackle unconventional narratives post-Oscar.

Kidman's versatility continued with supporting turns, such as in *Cold Mountain* (2003), where her portrayal of Ada contributed to the film's critical success and eight Oscar nominations, though Renee Zellweger won Best Supporting Actress. Commercial efforts like *Bewitched* (2005), a comedy remake grossing $131 million worldwide against a $85 million budget, drew mixed notices but affirmed her box-office draw. By 2008, she starred in Baz Luhrmann's epic *Australia* opposite Hugh Jackman, portraying an English aristocrat in pre-World War II Outback, which earned $211 million globally on a $130 million budget despite a 53% Rotten Tomatoes score criticizing its length and clichés. Her performance was noted for evoking historical romance amid the film's ambitious scope.

### Independent films and role diversification (2010–2016)

In 2010, Kidman co-produced and starred as Becca Corbett in *Rabbit Hole*, a drama depicting a couple's grief following the accidental death of their four-year-old son. Directed by John Cameron Mitchell, the film adapted David Lindsay-Abaire's Pulitzer Prize-winning play and premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 12, 2010, before a limited U.S. release on December 17, 2010. Her restrained portrayal of suppressed anguish earned critical praise and an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress, highlighting her commitment to intimate, character-driven narratives over commercial blockbusters.

Kidman continued exploring provocative roles in 2012 with *The Paperboy*, directed by Lee Daniels, where she played Charlotte Bless, a provocative Southern woman fixated on a death row inmate. The film, adapted from Pete Dexter's novel, premiered at the Cannes Film Festival on May 16, 2012, and featured a controversial scene involving Kidman's character urinating on co-star Zac Efron to revive him from a jellyfish sting. Despite mixed reviews—with a 45% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes—critics noted Kidman's fearless commitment to the character's raw sexuality and desperation, marking a departure from her earlier poised personas.

By 2013, Kidman diversified into psychological thriller territory as Evelyn Stoker in *Stoker*, directed by Park Chan-wook in his English-language debut. Released on March 1, 2013, the film portrayed her as a tense, emotionally distant mother whose family unravels after the arrival of her enigmatic brother-in-law. The role's subtle menace and the film's gothic atmosphere received a 70% Rotten Tomatoes score, with Kidman's performance lauded for its icy precision amid the director's stylized violence. Later that year, in *The Railway Man* (released April 10, 2014, in some markets but filmed in 2013), she portrayed Patti Lomax, the supportive wife of a World War II torture survivor played by Colin Firth, in a biographical drama based on Eric Lomax's memoir. The film earned a 67% approval rating, with Kidman's grounded depiction of marital resilience providing emotional anchor to the story of trauma and reconciliation.

In 2015, Kidman led Werner Herzog's *Queen of the Desert* as British explorer and archaeologist Gertrude Bell, chronicling her early 20th-century travels and influence on Middle Eastern politics. The independently financed biopic premiered at the Berlin International Film Festival on February 6, 2015, but garnered only an 18% Rotten Tomatoes rating, with detractors citing its episodic structure and lack of depth despite Kidman's authoritative presence in period attire. These selections across genres—from grief-stricken domesticity to historical adventurism—illustrated Kidman's deliberate shift toward edgier, less conventional characters in lower-budget productions, often prioritizing artistic risk over box-office guarantees, as evidenced by the films' festival circuits and modest theatrical runs.

### Television series and recent cinematic work (2017–present)

In 2017, Kidman expanded her television presence with the HBO miniseries *Big Little Lies*, where she portrayed Celeste Wright, a lawyer enduring domestic abuse, while also serving as an executive producer alongside Reese Witherspoon. The seven-episode first season, adapted from Liane Moriarty's novel and directed by Jean-Marc Vallée, premiered on February 19, 2017, and averaged 1.8 million U.S. viewers per episode. For her performance, Kidman received the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series or Movie on September 17, 2017. The series itself won the Emmy for Outstanding Limited Series, with additional acting Emmys for Alexander Skarsgård and Laura Dern. A second season aired in June 2019, focusing on the aftermath of the first season's events without the original novel's constraints.

Kidman continued in prestige television with a supporting role as Julia Edwards in the second season of *Top of the Lake: China Girl*, which premiered on BBC Two and SundanceTV in 2017. In 2020, she starred as Grace Fraser, a psychologist whose life unravels amid a murder investigation, in the HBO miniseries *The Undoing*, written by David E. Kelley and directed by Susanne Bier; the six-episode series debuted on October 11, 2020. Subsequent projects included the role of wellness retreat leader Masha Dmitrichenko in the 2021 Hulu limited series *Nine Perfect Strangers*, adapted from the novel by Moriarty; an episode in the 2022 anthology *Roar*; a recurring part as CIA operative Kaitlyn Meade in the Paramount+ series *Lioness* starting in 2023; and the lead as American expatriate Margaret Woo in the 2024 Amazon Prime Video miniseries *Expats*, created by Lulu Wang and premiered on January 26, 2024, examining grief and expatriate life in Hong Kong amid the 2014 Umbrella Movement protests. 

On the cinematic front, Kidman balanced commercial blockbusters and dramatic roles. She played headmistress Martha Farnsworth in Sofia Coppola's Civil War-era remake *The Beguiled* (2017), which premiered at Cannes on May 24, 2017, earning Coppola the Best Director award. In the DC Extended Universe film *Aquaman* (2018), released on December 21, 2018, she portrayed Queen Atlanna, mother to Jason Momoa's Arthur Curry, contributing to the film's global box office of over $1.15 billion.  She reprised the role in *Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom* (2023), which grossed $434 million worldwide despite production delays.

Kidman's independent efforts included the lead in *Destroyer* (2018), as undercover cop Erin Bell grappling with past failures, and as mother Nancy Eamons in the conversion therapy drama *Boy Erased* (2018). In *Bombshell* (2019), she depicted Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson, who sued network executive Roger Ailes for sexual harassment, in Jay Roach's ensemble film released on December 13, 2019, based on real events leading to Ailes' 2016 resignation.  Recent releases featured her as Romy, a CEO in a submissive affair with a young intern, in the erotic thriller *Babygirl* (2024), directed by Halina Reijn and released on December 25, 2024. In 2025, she starred as Nancy Vandergroot in the thriller *Holland*.

## Other professional endeavors

### Producing credits and business ventures

Kidman co-founded the production company Blossom Films with producer Per Saari in 2010, focusing on developing film and television projects that support artists and explore diverse narratives.

Blossom Films' debut production was the drama *Rabbit Hole* (2010), in which Kidman starred as a grieving mother alongside Aaron Eckhart and Dianne Wiest; the film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival and earned Kidman a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress. Subsequent film credits include *Monte Carlo* (2011), a teen adventure starring Selena Gomez, and *The Family Fang* (2016), a dark comedy adaptation directed by and starring Jason Bateman. The company expanded into television with high-profile limited series such as *Big Little Lies* (2017) for HBO, co-executive produced by Kidman and earning her a Primetime Emmy for Outstanding Limited Series; *The Undoing* (2020), a psychological thriller; *Nine Perfect Strangers* (2021), adapted from Liane Moriarty's novel; *Love \u0026 Death* (2023), starring Elizabeth Olsen; and *The Perfect Couple* (2024) for Netflix.

In June 2018, Blossom Films secured a first-look deal with Amazon Studios to develop original content across film, television, and digital formats, leading to projects like the announced adaptation of *A Good Marriage* by Kimberly McCreight. Upcoming productions under the banner include *Practical Magic 2* (2025), a sequel to the 1998 film, and *Holland* (2025).

Beyond producing, Kidman has engaged in investment ventures, notably becoming the first celebrity investor in Vegamour, a plant-based hair wellness brand, in May 2022, aligning with her interest in innovative consumer products.

### Music contributions and endorsement deals

Kidman has incorporated musical performances into several film roles, leveraging her acting background rather than formal vocal training. In Baz Luhrmann's 2001 musical *Moulin Rouge!*, she portrayed Satine and sang multiple numbers, including the duet "Come What May" with co-star Ewan McGregor, contributing to the film's soundtrack that received critical acclaim for its eclectic pop interpretations of standards. The performance showcased her breathy, emotive style, which aligned with the character's cabaret aesthetic, though reviewers noted it prioritized dramatic delivery over technical precision.

Beyond film soundtracks, Kidman released standalone recordings. In late 2001, she collaborated with Robbie Williams on a cover of "Somethin' Stupid," originally by Frank Sinatra and Nancy Sinatra, which debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart and became that year's Christmas number-one single, selling over 210,000 copies in its first week. She later covered Randy Crawford's "One Day I'll Fly Away" as a single in April 2002, tied to *Moulin Rouge!* promotion, peaking at number 46 on the UK chart. More recently, she contributed vocals to tracks like "Female" on Keith Urban's 2018 album *Graffiti U* and appeared on soundtracks for projects such as *Big Little Lies*, though these were limited to incidental singing rather than lead performances.

Kidman has secured high-profile endorsement deals, often featuring in luxury advertising campaigns that emphasize elegance and sophistication. Since 2004, she has served as a global ambassador for Omega watches, appearing in commercials for models like the Constellation collection, with contracts reportedly valued in the multimillion-dollar range annually. From the early 2010s, she became the face of Chanel No. 5 perfume, starring in directed campaigns by Baz Luhrmann and later Joe Wright, including a 2010 commercial that depicted her in a narrative of romance and flight, aligning with the brand's heritage of celebrity partnerships.

Additional deals include ambassadorships for Jimmy Choo footwear, Neutrogena skincare (promoting anti-aging products in the 2000s), and Balenciaga fashion. In July 2025, Shiseido Group appointed her global brand ambassador for Clé de Peau Beauté, with her debut campaign featuring her daughter Faith Margaret and focusing on skincare innovation, launched amid her ongoing Hollywood commitments. Kidman has also endorsed non-luxury entities, such as AMC Theatres' "We Make Movies Better" ad series starting in 2023, with updated versions airing in 2025 to promote cinema experiences. These partnerships have contributed significantly to her estimated net worth, exceeding $250 million as of 2024, through fees, residuals, and equity stakes where applicable.

## Reception and legacy

### Awards, nominations, and commercial impact

Kidman won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her portrayal of Virginia Woolf in *The Hours* (2002), marking her sole win from five nominations in the category, with additional nods for *Moulin Rouge!* (2001), *Rabbit Hole* (2010), *Lion* (2016), and *Being the Ricardos* (2021). She also secured a BAFTA Award for Best Actress for *The Hours*, her only win from five nominations in leading roles.

Her television work has yielded two Primetime Emmy Awards for *Big Little Lies* (2017), including Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series and Outstanding Limited Series as producer, from three total acting nominations. Kidman has won six Golden Globe Awards from 17 nominations, spanning films like *To Die For* (1996), *Moulin Rouge!* (2001), *The Hours* (2003), *Being the Ricardos* (2022), and series such as *Big Little Lies* (2017) and *The Undoing* (2021). Across her career, industry trackers record 119 wins and 280 nominations from major awards bodies, including Screen Actors Guild and Critics' Choice honors.

Kidman's films have driven significant commercial performance, with worldwide box office earnings from her starring roles exceeding $1.5 billion as of 2023. Her highest-grossing releases include *Australia* (2008) at $211 million, *Moulin Rouge!* (2001) at $179 million, and *The Golden Compass* (2007) at $372 million in supporting capacity, demonstrating her draw in period dramas and blockbusters. Beyond cinema, her endorsement deals have amplified brand visibility; as global ambassador for Clé de Peau Beauté since 2025, she promotes luxury skincare, while her 2021 AMC Theatres advertisement achieved viral status, fostering audience engagement and theater attendance during post-pandemic recovery. Producing ventures like *Big Little Lies* further underscore her economic influence, yielding high viewership and Emmy-winning returns for HBO.

### Critical analyses and industry influence

Critics have analyzed Nicole Kidman's acting style as emphasizing naturalistic immersion, often involving physical and emotional transformations to embody characters, as seen in her portrayal of Virginia Woolf in *The Hours* (2002), for which she received an Academy Award. This approach contrasts with earlier perceptions of her as a glamorous figure reliant on appearance, with some reviewers noting her evolution toward roles demanding vulnerability, such as the weathered detective in *Destroyer* (2018), praised for adding depth to genre conventions. However, detractors, including film critics and public commentators, have criticized certain performances for perceived stiffness or over-reliance on cosmetic enhancements, arguing that these factors undermine authenticity in roles requiring raw emotional range, as evidenced by mixed reception to films like *The Stepford Wives* (2004), which earned a 26% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Such critiques often stem from broader skepticism about Hollywood's beauty standards, though empirical data from her five Academy Award nominations and four Golden Globe wins for acting underscore a career marked by critical acclaim in dramatic works over comedic or action-oriented ones.

Analyses of Kidman's oeuvre highlight her versatility across genres, from the musical exuberance of *Moulin Rouge!* (2001) to the psychological intensity of *Dogville* (2003), positioning her as an actress who bridges independent cinema and commercial blockbusters, with box office successes like *Batman Forever* (1995) grossing over $336 million worldwide. Yet, quantitative reviews reveal inconsistencies, with ten of her films scoring below 40% on Rotten Tomatoes, including *Just Go with It* (2011) at 18%, attributed by some to mismatched casting in lighter fare that exposes limitations in comedic timing compared to her strengths in pathos-driven narratives. Film scholars have further examined her career through a lens of resilience against typecasting, noting how post-*Eyes Wide Shut* (1999) collaborations with directors like Stanley Kubrick and Lars von Trier elevated her to auteur-level prestige, fostering a reputation for risk-taking that influenced subsequent prestige television adaptations.

Kidman's industry influence manifests through her production company, Blossom Films, founded in 2010, which has generated over a dozen projects, including the Emmy-winning *Big Little Lies* (2017–2019), thereby elevating limited-series formats and creating opportunities for female-led storytelling in streaming eras. By 2024, she had headlined eight new series in eight years, explicitly stating her prolific output aims to "create jobs for people" and support emerging talent amid industry contractions, countering narratives of overexposure with data on sustained viewership for HBO and Netflix collaborations. Her advocacy at events like the 2025 Cannes Kering Women in Motion awards emphasized scripting stronger female roles, influencing studio decisions toward more substantive parts for women over 40, as her own transitions from film to television have normalized high-profile actors in prestige TV, boosting genres like domestic thrillers. This dual role as performer and producer has positioned her as a stabilizing force in a volatile market, with her Chanel No. 5 campaigns since 2004 generating estimated billions in revenue, exemplifying how star power sustains brand-film synergies.

## Personal life

### Marriages, divorces, and children

Nicole Kidman first married American actor Tom Cruise on December 24, 1990, in Telluride, Colorado, after meeting on the set of the film *Days of Thunder* earlier that year. The couple, who had no biological children together due to fertility issues, adopted two: daughter Isabella Jane Cruise, born December 22, 1992, in London, and son Connor Anthony Cruise, born January 17, 1995, also in London. Their marriage ended in divorce finalized on August 8, 2001, after 10 years together, with joint custody of the children awarded.

Kidman began dating Australian country music singer Keith Urban in 2005, and they married on June 25, 2006, at Cardinal Cerretti Memorial Chapel in Manly, Sydney. The couple welcomed daughter Sunday Rose Kidman Urban on July 7, 2008, in Nashville, Tennessee, followed by daughter Faith Margaret Kidman Urban on December 28, 2010, born via gestational surrogacy in the United States. On September 30, 2025, Kidman filed for divorce in Los Angeles Superior Court, citing irreconcilable differences and listing the date of separation as the filing date itself; the petition references a prenuptial agreement and seeks to enforce its terms regarding spousal support and property division. A parenting plan for joint custody of their daughters was reportedly signed weeks prior.

### Religious faith and spiritual influences

Nicole Kidman was raised in an Irish Catholic family in Sydney, Australia, where her devout grandmother instilled daily prayer practices that profoundly shaped her early spiritual outlook. Her mother, Janelle Ann Kidman, followed Christian Science principles, while her father, Antony Kidman, identified as an atheist, creating a household blend of influences that emphasized personal spirituality over rigid dogma. As a child, Kidman attended a Catholic school and expressed a strong attraction to religious life, contemplating becoming a nun due to her fascination with convent discipline and service.

In adulthood, Kidman has consistently affirmed her Catholic faith as central to her identity, describing herself as spiritually committed with an "absolute belief in God" that guides her moral and familial decisions. She attends Mass regularly and raises her daughters, Sunday Rose and Faith Margaret, within the Catholic tradition, incorporating prayer and church involvement despite occasional teasing from Hollywood peers about her overt religiosity. During her 1990–2001 marriage to Tom Cruise, Kidman engaged with Scientology, studying its doctrines to align with her husband, but post-divorce accounts indicate she rejected the organization, viewing it as incompatible with her Catholic roots, with church interference cited as a factor in the marital rift. Her father's background as a psychologist may have reinforced her skepticism toward Scientology's psychological claims.

Kidman's spiritual expressions appear in interviews where she prioritizes faith over fame, crediting Catholicism for providing resilience amid career pressures, though she maintains tolerance for others' beliefs without proselytizing. This return to Catholicism post-Scientology underscores a reversion to familial influences rather than doctrinal innovation, aligning with her stated preference for sacramental marriage and motherhood over celibate vows.

## Political views and philanthropy

### Expressed political positions

Nicole Kidman has described herself as reticent to discuss politics publicly, preferring to focus on specific issues rather than partisan alignments. In a January 2017 BBC interview, she emphasized supporting democratic outcomes, stating that Americans should back whichever candidate wins the presidency, regardless of personal preference, as "that's what the country's based on." She later clarified that her remarks on President-elect Donald Trump were not an endorsement but a reflection of her belief in democratic principles, rejecting interpretations that portrayed her as politically aligned with him. 

Kidman has made financial contributions to Democratic candidates and organizations, totaling $25,500 since 1994, including notable donations to Hillary Clinton's 2000 U.S. Senate campaign. In January 2017, she publicly supported the legalization of same-sex marriage in Australia, expressing in a BBC interview that she favors it because "I love when people love each other." 

As a dual U.S.-Australian citizen and Roman Catholic, Kidman has engaged in issue-oriented advocacy through her role as a UN Women Goodwill Ambassador, focusing on ending violence against women and promoting gender equality without tying it to electoral politics.  In the 2020 U.S. presidential election, she voted early by mail and encouraged voter participation but did not disclose her choice or endorse candidates. She has not publicly expressed positions on topics such as abortion, gun control, or immigration.

### Humanitarian efforts and ambassadorships

Kidman has served as a Goodwill Ambassador for UN Women since 2006, initially appointed under its predecessor organization UNIFEM, with a focus on raising global awareness about violence against women and broader infringements on women's human rights. In this capacity, she undertook her first field mission in 2006 to Kosovo to highlight women's roles in post-conflict recovery and has co-hosted events such as the 2016 gala marking the 20th anniversary of the UN Trust Fund to End Violence against Women. She donated $500,000 to the UN Trust Fund in December 2018 to support initiatives combating gender-based violence, emphasizing the need for sustained action on this human rights issue. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Kidman collaborated with UN Women in June 2020 to promote awareness campaigns urging an end to violence against women amid lockdowns.

Since 1994, Kidman has acted as a Goodwill Ambassador for UNICEF, advocating for the organization's efforts to aid disadvantaged children worldwide through fundraising and public endorsements. Her involvement includes leveraging her public platform to support UNICEF's child welfare programs, though specific mission details beyond general advocacy are less documented in public records.

Beyond these roles, Kidman has participated in targeted philanthropic events, such as attending an amfAR benefit auction in Dallas on October 4, 2025, where she presented an award to support AIDS research and HIV prevention efforts. She has also backed initiatives addressing disaster relief and broader women's issues, aligning her efforts with organizations combating violence and aiding vulnerable populations.

## Controversies and criticisms

### Scientology associations and family estrangement

Nicole Kidman was introduced to the Church of Scientology through her marriage to Tom Cruise, which lasted from December 24, 1990, to August 8, 2001. Cruise, a prominent adherent since the late 1980s, encouraged her participation, and reports indicate Kidman attended introductory courses and studied church materials during the early years of their relationship to align with his beliefs. However, Kidman has consistently denied formal membership, stating in later interviews that she remained an outsider despite efforts to engage.

Tensions escalated toward the marriage's end, with former church executive Mike Rinder alleging that Scientology leadership viewed Kidman as a potential threat due to her non-committal stance and conducted audits deeming her a "suppressive person"—a designation for individuals seen as antagonistic to the church. Church operatives reportedly monitored her communications, including wiretapping allegations detailed in Lawrence Wright's 2013 book *Going Clear*, which cited intercepted calls to Australian family members expressing doubts about Scientology. These interventions, per Rinder and other ex-members, fostered marital discord by emphasizing doctrinal incompatibilities, contributing to the 2001 divorce filing initiated by Cruise.

Post-divorce, Kidman's adopted children with Cruise—Isabella Jane Cruise (born December 22, 1992) and Connor Antony Cruise (born January 17, 1995)—opted to reside primarily with their father in the United States and pursued active involvement in Scientology. Isabella has publicly shared testimonials about her auditing training within the church as recently as January 2025, while Connor has resided in Scientology-affiliated communities in Clearwater, Florida.

The children's alignment with Scientology has coincided with limited public interaction with Kidman, who resides in Australia and Nashville with her family from her second marriage. Joint appearances ceased after around 2008, and Kidman has described the distance as a function of their adult autonomy and differing geographies, affirming in a 2018 *Who* magazine interview: "They are adults now. They have made choices to be Scientologists and as a mother, it’s the way that goes. You have to accept them." Critics, including ex-Scientologists, attribute the estrangement to the church's disconnection policy, which mandates severing ties with declared suppressives like Kidman to protect adherents from perceived negative influence—a practice Hubbard codified in church policy directives. Kidman avoids endorsing this interpretation, emphasizing unconditional love while noting occasional private contact.

Following the September 2024 death of Kidman's mother, Janelle Kidman, reports emerged of intensified reconciliation efforts, with sources claiming she seeks renewed bonds amid family grief, though Connor's immersion in church life presents ongoing barriers. Kidman has refrained from public criticism of Scientology, contrasting with accounts from defectors who highlight its relational costs.

### Backlash over film roles and public behavior

Nicole Kidman has encountered criticism for selecting roles perceived as provocative or mismatched to her persona, with detractors arguing that such choices prioritize sensationalism over artistic merit. In the 2004 film *Birth*, her portrayal of a widow sharing a bathtub scene with a 10-year-old boy actor drew controversy for its implied intimacy, prompting debates over appropriateness despite the director's defense of its emotional intent. Similarly, her performance as Grace Kelly in the 2014 biopic *Grace of Monaco* faced backlash from critics who deemed it superficial and lacking the elegance of the real princess, contributing to the film's poor reception at Cannes.

More recently, Kidman's role as a high-powered executive in a sexual relationship with a young intern in the 2024 thriller *Babygirl* elicited backlash for its explicit content and her public comments on the filming process. She admitted in interviews that the role aroused her to the point of halting production temporarily, a disclosure that some outlets and social media users labeled embarrassing or indicative of unprofessionalism. Reports also surfaced that her husband, Keith Urban, expressed discomfort with the intimate scenes, with sources claiming such roles strained their marriage and factored into separation rumors in October 2025.

Casting controversies have further fueled criticism, notably her portrayal of Lucille Ball in the 2021 film *Being the Ricardos*. Fans and commentators objected to an Australian actress embodying the iconic American comedian, leading to widespread backlash that prompted Kidman to briefly consider quitting the role before proceeding.

In terms of public behavior, Kidman has been accused of rudeness during high-profile appearances. At the December 2024 premiere of *Babygirl*, a video captured her abruptly interrupting and dismissing a reporter's question about her Australian roots, prompting fans on social media to brand her response as curt and elitist. Additionally, persistent scrutiny over her cosmetic enhancements has drawn ire, with observers noting her denial of procedures despite visible changes, fueling perceptions of vanity; for instance, post-50, she has been critiqued for maintaining an overly youthful appearance that some view as inauthentic to aging.

### Accusations of vanity and industry practices

Nicole Kidman has faced persistent speculation regarding cosmetic procedures, with observers attributing changes in her facial appearance over decades to interventions such as facelifts, fillers, and Botox injections, often framing these as evidence of vanity driven by Hollywood's youth-obsessed culture. In a 2007 interview with Allure, Kidman acknowledged trying Botox but discontinued it after disliking the results, stating it made her face look "shiny and weird" and emphasizing her preference for a natural appearance. She has repeatedly denied undergoing major surgeries like facelifts or rhinoplasty, crediting her look to genetics, sunscreen use, and a healthy lifestyle including horseback riding and minimal sun exposure. Despite these statements, public scrutiny intensified in December 2024 following her appearance at the Gotham Awards, where her taut facial features prompted renewed accusations of excessive surgical alterations and possible use of weight-loss drugs like Ozempic, though no medical confirmation exists.

Critics have accused Kidman of embodying vanity through high-profile image choices that prioritize stylized youthfulness, such as her February 2022 Vanity Fair Hollywood Issue cover featuring a micro-miniskirt and bralette ensemble, which she personally requested despite backlash for alleged over-Photoshopping and infantilization of a then-54-year-old actress. Kidman defended the shoot in July 2023, insisting it aligned with her vision and rejecting claims of exploitation, but detractors argued it reinforced industry's superficial standards, with some online commentary highlighting perceived ageism in the styling. This incident underscores broader accusations that Kidman's career choices reflect vanity-fueled conformity to beauty norms, where actresses face implicit pressure to maintain an ageless facade to secure roles.

In the context of Hollywood practices, Kidman has been indirectly linked to industry dynamics that incentivize vanity, as evidenced by a 2002 incident during the filming of *The Hours*, where producer Harvey Weinstein reportedly pressured her to remove a prosthetic nose used for her portrayal of Virginia Woolf, viewing it as detracting from her conventional attractiveness. Kidman resisted, prioritizing artistic accuracy, but the episode illustrates causal pressures within the industry—where physical alterations, whether surgical or prosthetic, intersect with commercial viability and accusations of excessive self-focus. While Kidman has critiqued such norms in interviews, noting the "tough" expectations for women in film, detractors contend her sustained emphasis on polished public images perpetuates a cycle of vanity-driven practices rather than challenging them substantively. These accusations remain speculative, lacking empirical proof of wrongdoing, and reflect broader media tendencies to scrutinize female celebrities' appearances through a lens of presumed artifice, often without equivalent rigor applied to male counterparts.
