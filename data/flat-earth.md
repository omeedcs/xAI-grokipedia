# Flat Earth

The Flat Earth model describes Earth as a flat, disk-shaped plane enclosed under a dome-like firmament, with the sun and moon as small, nearby objects circling above it, and Antarctica forming an encircling ice wall that contains the oceans. This conception dominated ancient cosmologies in civilizations such as Babylonian, Egyptian, and early Hebrew traditions, where empirical observations were limited and mythological explanations prevailed. By the 3rd century BCE, Greek philosophers including Aristotle and Eratosthenes provided observational evidence—such as the circular shadow of Earth on the moon during lunar eclipses and differing shadow angles at distant locations—for its sphericity, calculations that accurately estimated Earth's circumference to within a few percent.

Despite this empirical foundation, which has been corroborated by subsequent measurements including circumnavigations, gravitational models, and orbital mechanics, the flat Earth idea persisted in some religious interpretations and was revived in the 19th century by figures like Samuel Rowbotham, whose "Zetetic" experiments purported to disprove curvature but ignored atmospheric refraction and scale. Modern advocacy, organized through the International Flat Earth Research Society founded in 1956 by Samuel Shenton amid skepticism of space exploration, alleges a vast conspiracy by NASA and governments to fabricate evidence of a globe for control or profit, yet offers no consistent alternative framework that predicts phenomena like seasonal sunlight variations or flight paths. Proponents' claims falter against direct tests, such as high-altitude balloon footage revealing curvature and the consistent horizon dip with altitude, underscoring the model's incompatibility with causal mechanisms governing observed celestial motions and geodesy. The belief's resurgence since the 2010s, fueled by social media, highlights distrust in institutional science amid broader antiscience sentiments, though it remains a fringe position refuted by reproducible experiments accessible to individuals.

## Core Model and Beliefs

### Description of the Flat Earth Model

The Flat Earth model, as articulated by modern proponents such as the Flat Earth Society, depicts Earth as a flat, circular disc approximately 24,900 miles in diameter, with the North Pole positioned at its center. Continents and oceans extend outward from this central point, while the outer boundary consists of a continuous 150-foot-high ice wall corresponding to Antarctica, which purportedly contains the world's oceans and prevents peripheral drainage. This configuration draws from azimuthal equidistant projections, adapted to represent landmasses without spherical curvature.

Celestial mechanics in the model reject heliocentrism and geocentric rotation, instead positing that the Sun and Moon are compact, self-luminous spheres, each about 32 miles in diameter, hovering roughly 3,000 miles above the plane's surface. These bodies traverse circular paths concentric with the North Pole, with the Sun's smaller radius explaining localized daylight; as it moves away, perspective and atmospheric refraction diminish its visibility, simulating sunset without Earth's rotation or orbital motion. Seasonal variations arise from the Sun's alleged spiral trajectory, expanding and contracting its orbital radius over the year.

Gravity is dismissed as a fictitious force; instead, "universal acceleration" proposes the entire disc accelerates upward perpetually at 9.8 m/s², engendering the sensation of downward pull through equivalence with inertial frames. Alternatively, some variants invoke buoyancy and density gradients in an electromagnetic or aetheric medium, where objects "fall" toward the plane due to relative densities without attractive forces. Stars and planets appear as distant, rotating projections or small wanderers on or above a hemispherical firmament dome, rotating daily around the polar axis to account for stellar motion.

Eclipses and other phenomena receive ad hoc explanations, such as an invisible "antimoon" or shadow object causing lunar eclipses, positioned opposite the Moon. Proponents claim empirical observations, like unchanging horizon levels from high altitudes or alleged inconsistencies in flight paths, support this static plane over spherical models, though these assertions stem primarily from reinterpretations of perspective and optics rather than standard measurements. Variations exist, including infinite plane models without edges or bi-polar configurations, but the disc-with-ice-wall remains the dominant depiction in contemporary flat Earth literature.

### Fundamental Tenets and Variations

The core tenet of modern Flat Earth belief posits the Earth as a stationary, flat disk approximately 24,900 miles in diameter, with the North Pole at its center and the continents radiating outward toward an encircling perimeter formed by Antarctica as an expansive ice wall roughly 150-200 feet high that prevents oceans from spilling over the edge. This configuration draws from the azimuthal equidistant map projection, often associated with the United Nations flag, which proponents claim accurately represents distances and geography without distortion.
Celestial mechanics in this model reject heliocentrism, describing the Sun and Moon as small, self-luminescent bodies, each about 32 miles in diameter, positioned approximately 3,000 miles above the plane, traversing circular paths above the disk to produce day, night, and seasons through local spotlight illumination rather than vast distances. Stars are viewed as distant lights affixed to a rotating dome or firmament, with eclipses attributed to an invisible "shadow object" or anti-moon aligning with the Moon.
Explanations for downward motion diverge among adherents: the Flat Earth Society advocates Universal Acceleration, wherein the entire disk constantly accelerates upward at 9.8 m/s² to simulate gravity, powered by an unknown force termed "dark energy," while others invoke density and buoyancy in an electromagnetic atmosphere, dismissing gravitational attraction as a fictitious force. Proponents universally assert a global conspiracy by governments, NASA, and scientific institutions to conceal this reality, motivated by control, profit from space programs, or suppression of biblical cosmology.
Variations include the infinite plane model, which eliminates edges by extending the plane indefinitely, rendering Antarctic barriers unnecessary and attributing southern hemisphere phenomena to perspective limits. Some incorporate a solid dome or firmament enclosing the disk, inspired by ancient or religious texts, with electromagnetic or divine mechanisms suspending waters above; others propose a concave Earth hollowing upward into a spherical cavity, though this remains fringe. Biblical literalists among proponents align the model with Genesis interpretations of a firmament dividing waters, rejecting evolution and deep time, while secular variants emphasize empirical observation over scripture.

## Historical Perspectives

### Ancient and Early Beliefs

In ancient Mesopotamian cosmology, the Earth was regarded as a flat disk resting atop primordial waters, enclosed by a vaulted heaven. The Babylonian Map of the World, inscribed on a clay tablet around the 6th century BCE, depicts this model with Babylon at the center of a circular landmass surrounded by a "Bitter River" symbolizing the encircling ocean, beyond which lie mythical regions.  This schematic reflects empirical observations of a seemingly boundless horizon and riverine boundaries, aligning with cuneiform texts describing the cosmos as layered with earth below and firmament above.

Ancient Egyptian cosmology similarly portrayed the Earth as a flat expanse, often a rectangular or disk-shaped plane floating on the chaotic waters of Nun, upheld by the air god Shu while the sky goddess Nut arched overhead as a solid dome. Texts from the Pyramid era (circa 2600–2500 BCE) and later sources, such as the Book of the Dead, describe four supports or corners anchoring the earth, guarded by deities, with the sun god Ra traversing the sky daily before submerging into the underworld waters.  This view stemmed from observable phenomena like the Nile's floods and the apparent flatness of the desert landscape extending to watery horizons.

Early Greek beliefs, prior to philosophical shifts, echoed these conceptions, with epic poets depicting the Earth as a flat, circular disk hemmed by the world-encircling river Oceanus. Homer's *Iliad* and *Odyssey*, composed around 800 BCE, describe the oikoumene (inhabited world) as a planar "island" of land ringed by sea, where celestial bodies traverse a dome-like sky and the underworld lies beneath.  Hesiod's *Theogony* reinforces this by outlining a flat earth generated from chaos, supported by Atlas at its edges, consistent with Bronze Age observations of uniform horizons and seasonal sun paths. Such models prioritized direct sensory evidence over abstract geometry, persisting in literature until Ionian thinkers like Anaximander proposed variants, such as a squat cylindrical earth suspended in space around 550 BCE.

### Classical Challenges and Spherical Consensus

In the 6th century BCE, Pythagoras of Samos proposed that the Earth is spherical, reasoning that the sphere represents the most perfect geometric form and thus befits the cosmos's central body. This idea, initially philosophical rather than empirically grounded, marked an early departure from prevailing flat-Earth cosmologies in Near Eastern traditions, which depicted the world as a disk floating on water or supported by pillars.

By the 4th century BCE, Aristotle provided multiple observational challenges to flat-Earth models, drawing on direct evidence incompatible with a planar surface. He noted that ships approaching from the horizon first reveal their upper masts before their hulls, indicating curvature rather than a flat expanse where the entire vessel would appear simultaneously. Additionally, during lunar eclipses, the Earth's shadow on the Moon consistently forms a circular arc, a projection only a sphere could produce from any angle, whereas a flat disk would cast an elliptical or straight-edged shadow depending on orientation. Aristotle further observed latitudinal variations in visible constellations—such as southern stars invisible from northern Greece, with their altitudes shifting predictably southward—evidence of a curved surface obstructing views, not possible on a flat plane where all stars would remain equidistant.

These arguments gained quantitative support in the 3rd century BCE through Eratosthenes of Cyrene, who calculated the Earth's circumference using geometric principles. Observing that the Sun cast no shadow in Syene (modern Aswan) at summer solstice while producing a 7.2-degree angle in Alexandria—equivalent to 1/50 of a full circle—he multiplied the known distance between the cities (approximately 5,000 stadia) by 50, yielding about 250,000 stadia, roughly equivalent to 39,000–46,000 kilometers depending on stade length, closely approximating the modern polar circumference of 40,008 km. This measurement presupposed sphericity, as shadows on a flat Earth would align uniformly under parallel solar rays, contradicting the observed divergence.

By the Hellenistic period, these empirical and mathematical demonstrations fostered a consensus among Greek and later Roman scholars that the Earth is spherical, supplanting flat-Earth views in educated circles. Figures like Plato endorsed the sphere for its symmetry, while Ptolemy's 2nd-century CE *Almagest* integrated it into geocentric models without dissent, reflecting broad acceptance in classical antiquity. Flat-Earth remnants persisted in some poetic or mythological contexts but faced no serious philosophical defense against the accumulating geometric and observational data.

### Medieval Views and Debunking the Flat Earth Myth

During the early medieval period, the spherical Earth model inherited from ancient Greek philosophers such as Aristotle and Ptolemy remained the scholarly consensus in Europe, with empirical observations like the curved shadow during lunar eclipses and the hull-first disappearance of ships over the horizon reinforcing this view. Exceptions existed among some early Christian writers, such as Lactantius in the early 4th century and Cosmas Indicopleustes in the 6th century, who interpreted biblical passages literally to advocate a flat, disk-shaped Earth enclosed under a dome-like firmament, but these positions were marginal and not endorsed by the broader church or academic tradition. By the 7th century, influential figures like Isidore of Seville explicitly described the Earth as a sphere in his *Etymologiae*, stating it was "like a ball" rather than flat or elongated.

The Venerable Bede, writing around 725 in *De Natura Rerum*, affirmed the Earth's sphericity and calculated variations in daylight hours across latitudes as evidence of its round shape, demonstrating continuity with classical knowledge. In the high Middle Ages, this acceptance deepened; Johannes de Sacrobosco's *De Sphaera Mundi* (c. 1230), a widely used astronomical textbook, taught that the Earth was a sphere with a circumference of approximately 30,000 miles, drawing on Ptolemaic geography and influencing university curricula for centuries. Theologians like Thomas Aquinas in the 13th century integrated Aristotelian physics, rejecting flat Earth notions as incompatible with observable phenomena and rational inquiry.

The persistent myth that medieval Europeans, including the church hierarchy, universally believed in a flat Earth emerged in the 19th century amid anti-religious polemics, notably through Washington Irving's 1828 fictionalized biography of Christopher Columbus, which portrayed clerical opposition to Columbus's voyage as rooted in flat Earth dogma rather than accurate disputes over the planet's circumference. Earlier traces appear in 17th-century Protestant critiques, but no contemporary medieval sources document church councils or doctrines enforcing flat Earth belief; instead, spherical models appeared in manuscripts, globes, and art, such as the 14th-century *Hereford Mappa Mundi*, which stylized the world as flat for mnemonic purposes while presupposing roundness. This historiographical error, amplified by figures like John Draper in *History of the Conflict Between Religion and Science* (1874), ignores the empirical and textual evidence from over 300 medieval works affirming sphericity, underscoring how modern narratives sometimes prioritize ideological contrasts over primary sources. Among the uneducated populace, cosmographical details were rarely emphasized, but no archaeological or documentary record indicates widespread flat Earth conviction, as practical navigation and seasonal observations aligned with a spherical paradigm.

### Early Modern Persistence and 19th-Century Revival

Despite the firm establishment of the spherical Earth model through empirical observations in navigation and astronomy by the 16th century—evidenced by Ferdinand Magellan's circumnavigation (1519–1522), which demonstrated consistent return to starting points without edge encounters, and Tycho Brahe's precise stellar measurements supporting heliocentric implications—flat Earth notions found no substantive foothold among European scholars or navigators during the early modern period (c. 1500–1800). Isolated folk traditions or literalist biblical interpretations occasionally referenced a flat plane in poetic or theological contexts, but these did not constitute systematic advocacy or challenge the consensus derived from direct measurements, such as Jean Picard's 1669–1670 determination of Earth's quadrant arc length confirming curvature. No prominent figures or treatises promoted a flat model, reflecting the dominance of Ptolemaic and post-Copernican frameworks refined by empirical data rather than scriptural override.

The 19th-century revival emerged amid growing skepticism toward institutional science, particularly geology and astronomy, which proponents viewed as speculative. Samuel Birley Rowbotham (1816–1884), writing as "Parallax," initiated this through the Bedford Level experiment in 1838, sighting landmarks over a 6-mile (9.7 km) canal stretch in Cambridgeshire and claiming atmospheric refraction masked any curvature, thus proving flatness via direct observation. He expanded this in pamphlets from the 1840s and the 1849 book *Zetetic Astronomy: Earth Not a Globe*, advocating "zetetic" inquiry—relying on sensory evidence and rejecting mathematical abstractions—arguing water's level nature precluded spherical convexity. Rowbotham's lectures across Britain attracted followers, including wagers like John Hampden's 1866 bet with Alfred Russel Wallace, which Wallace won by demonstrating curvature but fueled controversy over experiment validity.

This movement formalized with organizations such as the Zetetic Society, established in the 1870s to promote empirical flat Earth proofs, and gained traction among biblical literalists emphasizing scriptural descriptions over scientific models. Lady Elizabeth Anne M. Blount (d. 1940s) advanced it via the 1893 Universal Zetetic Society and funding defenses against globe advocates, while Orlando Ferguson self-published *Map of the Square and Stationary Earth* in 1893, depicting a rectangular plane encircled by ice walls, drawn from 400 alleged biblical passages condemning globularity. These efforts, peaking in Victorian England, numbered adherents in hundreds but waned by century's end amid unchallenged spherical validations like eclipse predictions and polar explorations, though they laid groundwork for 20th-century iterations.

## Modern Flat Earth Movement

### Key Organizations and Figures

The International Flat Earth Research Society (IFERS), founded in 1956 by Samuel Shenton in Dover, England, represented the primary organized effort to revive flat Earth advocacy in the 20th century. Shenton, motivated by biblical literalism and distrust of scientific institutions, drew on 19th-century works like Samuel Rowbotham's *Zetetic Astronomy* to argue that empirical observations contradicted the spherical model. After Shenton's death in 1997, the group relocated to the United States under Charles K. Johnson, who served as president from 1971 until his death in 2001 and expanded membership to approximately 3,500 subscribers by emphasizing conspiratorial elements, such as attributing globe theory to Jesuit influences and stage magicians. The IFERS published a quarterly journal, *The Flat Earth*, distributing literature that challenged space exploration claims, including NASA's Apollo missions as hoaxes. Following Johnson's passing, the society fragmented, with no successor achieving similar scale; a related online Flat Earth Society forum emerged but functions more as a debate platform than a unified advocacy group.

In the internet era, the movement has decentralized, lacking formal organizations comparable to the IFERS and instead relying on individual influencers and ad hoc events like the Flat Earth International Conference (FEIC), first held in Raleigh, North Carolina, in November 2017 with about 500 attendees discussing topics from Antarctic ice walls to celestial mechanics reinterpretations. Subsequent FEICs, such as the 2018 Denver event drawing over 600 participants, were organized by proponents like Robbie Davidson, focusing on community building amid claims of institutional suppression.

Prominent modern figures include Eric Dubay, whose 2015 self-published book *200 Proofs Earth Is Not a Spinning Ball* compiles observational arguments against rotation and sphericity, such as unchanging water levels and horizon visibility, gaining traction through YouTube videos viewed millions of times. Mark Sargent, a Washington state resident, emerged as a recruiter via his "Flat Earth Clues" video series starting around 2015, emphasizing government deception in space imagery and appearing in the 2019 documentary *Behind the Curve*. David Weiss, host of *The Flat Earth Podcast* since 2017, has organized conferences and promoted the azimuthal equidistant map as the true world projection, attributing spherical beliefs to a multi-generational NASA-led conspiracy. These individuals, often self-taught and reliant on personal experiments, frame their work as zetetic inquiry—prioritizing direct sensory evidence over institutional authority—though their claims consistently fail under controlled scrutiny like laser horizon tests or flight path analyses.

### Internet Era Expansion and Conferences

The modern Flat Earth movement experienced significant growth during the internet era, particularly from the early 2010s onward, driven by social media platforms and video-sharing sites like YouTube. Online communities, including the Flat Earth Society's internet forum established in the 2000s, provided spaces for discussion and dissemination of flat Earth materials, evolving from textual arguments to multimedia content. YouTube algorithms amplified visibility, with channels featuring experiments, reinterpretations of observations, and conspiracy narratives attracting millions of views; for instance, videos questioning globe Earth models gained traction amid broader distrust in institutions. This digital proliferation shifted the movement from fringe print publications to a decentralized network of proponents, including figures like Eric Dubay, whose 2010 book *200 Proofs Earth Is Not a Spinning Ball* and subsequent videos influenced a wave of converts by compiling purported empirical challenges to spherical Earth claims.

Conferences marked a transition to offline organization, beginning with the inaugural Flat Earth International Conference (FEIC) held November 9–10, 2017, in Raleigh, North Carolina, organized by proponent David Weiss to foster community and share ideas. Attendance grew rapidly; the 2018 FEIC in Cary, North Carolina, drew several hundred participants discussing topics like NASA deception and horizon observations. A subsequent event, the Flat Earth International Conference in Denver, Colorado, on November 15–16, 2018, registered over 600 attendees from various countries, featuring speakers on experiential proofs and institutional critiques, reflecting the movement's international expansion via online recruitment. These gatherings emphasized personal testimonies and DIY experiments over formal debates, with proponents attributing growth to unfiltered internet access countering perceived mainstream suppression. By 2019, similar events continued in the U.S., solidifying conferences as annual hubs for networking and content creation that further fueled online dissemination.

### Recent Trends (2000–2025)

The modern Flat Earth movement gained traction in the early 2000s through online forums and the International Flat Earth Research Society, which had maintained a small online presence since its revival in the 1970s, but saw expanded reach with the proliferation of user-generated content platforms. By the mid-2010s, YouTube algorithms amplified flat Earth videos, recommending them to users interested in related conspiracy topics, leading to rapid subscriber growth for channels producing content like Mark Sargent's "Flat Earth Clues" series (launched around 2014) and Eric Dubay's "200 Proofs Earth Is Not a Spinning Ball" (published 2015).  This digital dissemination contributed to a surge in visibility, with proponents claiming personal "awakenings" after encountering such videos, though empirical surveys indicate the core believing population remained fringe.

Annual Flat Earth International Conferences emerged as a key organizing event starting in 2017, with the inaugural gathering in Raleigh, North Carolina, drawing several hundred attendees to discuss models, experiments, and institutional distrust narratives. Subsequent events, such as the 2018 Denver conference (over 600 registered participants) and 2019 editions, featured speakers like Dubay and Sargent, alongside amateur experiments like "Mad" Mike Hughes' 2017 steam-powered rocket launch attempting to visually confirm flatness (which failed and resulted in injury).  Conferences continued into the 2020s, adapting to virtual formats during the COVID-19 pandemic before resuming in-person, reflecting sustained but niche community engagement amid platform moderation efforts by YouTube to demote conspiracy content starting around 2019.

Public opinion polls from the period reveal flat Earth adherence at low levels, with a 2018 YouGov survey finding 2% of U.S. adults firmly endorsing it, rising to about 4% when including those expressing doubt about sphericity, particularly among younger demographics showing lower certainty in established geography.  A 2021 University of New Hampshire survey reported nearly 10% agreement with flat Earth claims among Americans, often overlapping with other conspiracies like faked moon landings, while a 2022 Carsey School analysis similarly pegged endorsement around 10%.  These figures suggest persistence rather than mass conversion, with belief correlating to lower science literacy and higher conspiracy proneness rather than widespread empirical reevaluation.

Into the 2020s, the movement intersected with broader distrust in institutions, amplified by pandemic-related skepticism, but faced counter-trends including high-profile debunkings and legal setbacks like Hughes' fatal 2020 rocket crash during a second attempt. Online metrics indicate stabilized rather than exponential growth post-2018 algorithm changes, with proponents pivoting to alternative platforms, though surveys up to 2025 show no significant uptick beyond the 2-10% range in the U.S. and comparable Western nations.  Global spread remains limited, concentrated in English-speaking communities, underscoring the theory's marginal status despite digital amplification.

## Proponents' Arguments

### Claimed Observational Evidence

Proponents assert that the horizon consistently appears flat across all elevations, from sea level to high-altitude balloon or aircraft observations, interpreting this as evidence against Earth's curvature, where approximately 8 inches of drop per mile squared should render distant objects invisible. They argue that amateur high-altitude footage, such as from weather balloons reaching 100,000 feet, shows no perceptible curve, attributing any minor distortions to fisheye lenses or atmospheric effects rather than geometry.

In canal-based experiments like the Bedford Level test conducted by Samuel Rowbotham in 1838 along a 6-mile straight stretch of the Old Bedford River in England, flat Earthers claim markers placed at intervals remained visible without the expected 24-foot bulge due to curvature, demonstrating water's inherent flatness over long distances. Rowbotham, under the pseudonym Parallax, reported observing a boat's hull and mast fully visible 6 miles away from eye level, rejecting refraction explanations and positing this as direct proof of a plane surface, a result echoed in subsequent proponent replications emphasizing atmospheric lensing only enhances visibility on a flat plane.

Water's behavior is cited as observational proof, with claims that large bodies like oceans and lakes maintain a level surface without adhering to a curved globe, as water seeks equilibrium and cannot curve without containment; proponents point to the Suez Canal's 100-mile length without locks for curvature compensation as empirical validation. They further argue that no empirical test shows water conforming to a spherical arc, contrasting this with the impossibility of continents "hanging" under a ball via gravity, which they view as a theoretical construct rather than observed phenomenon.

Celestial bodies are interpreted as proximate and local, with the Sun and Moon described as small disks (approximately 32 miles diameter) at 3,000 miles altitude, circling above the plane like spotlights; observations include the Sun's apparent small size and local illumination, where it rises and sets by angular recession and perspective rather than dipping below a horizon, evidenced by crepuscular rays converging to vanishing points. Moon phases are claimed to result from self-illumination or phase opposition relative to the Sun, not orbital shadows, supported by sightings of atmospheric halos and the Moon's consistent proximity appearance without parallax shifts expected on a globe. Proponents like Eric Dubay compile such sights, including unchanged star patterns from hemispheres and the Moon's "impossible" daytime visibility, as incompatible with heliocentric distances exceeding 200,000 miles for the Moon.

### Experimental and Interpretive Claims

Flat Earth proponents have historically invoked the Bedford Level experiment, conducted by Samuel Rowbotham (pseudonym Parallax) starting in 1838 along a 6-mile (9.7 km) straight stretch of the Old Bedford River in England. Rowbotham positioned a telescope approximately 8 inches (20 cm) above the water surface and observed a boat with a 6-foot (1.8 m) flagstaff rowed away from the observer; he claimed the entire boat remained fully visible without any apparent sinking of the hull below the horizon, as would be expected on a spherical Earth with an approximate 8 inches per mile squared curvature formula yielding about 24 feet (7.3 m) of drop over 6 miles after accounting for observer height.

Proponents interpret this result as empirical proof of a flat, non-curving surface, asserting that atmospheric refraction or observer error cannot fully explain away the visibility in repeated trials Rowbotham conducted over subsequent years. They argue the experiment demonstrates water's inherent flatness over long distances, aligning with first-hand observation rather than theoretical models, and cite it as foundational evidence against globe geometry.

In modern iterations, flat Earth advocates have replicated similar tests using lasers over bodies of water, such as frozen lakes or canals, claiming visibility of the beam at distances exceeding what spherical curvature should permit. For instance, proponents have reported successful sightings over 3-20 miles (5-32 km) in experiments like those on Lake Pontchartrain or Salton Sea, where the laser dot allegedly remains at the same height without drop, purportedly refuting an Earth radius of approximately 3,959 miles (6,371 km).

These laser tests are interpreted by proponents as direct measurement of zero curvature, with claims that any inconsistencies arise from globe model assumptions rather than refraction or beam divergence, emphasizing controlled conditions like calm weather and precise leveling to validate flatness. They often pair such experiments with horizon observations, asserting that the horizon distance scales linearly with height (as in flat plane perspective) rather than following the globe's square-root relationship, based on sightings from balloons or towers up to 100,000 feet (30 km) showing no visible arc.

Interpretively, proponents extend these experiments to celestial phenomena, claiming lunar eclipses result from an invisible "shadow object" or anti-moon rather than Earth's interposition, citing Alfred Russel Wallace's 1870 correction of Rowbotham's setup—which accounted for refraction and showed curvature—as manipulated data. They maintain that empirical repeatability in amateur setups worldwide supports a disc-shaped Earth under a dome, dismissing spherical predictions as unfalsifiable without conspiracy involvement.

### Conspiracy and Institutional Distrust Narratives

Flat Earth proponents assert that a multinational conspiracy orchestrated by governments, space agencies, and scientific bodies conceals the planet's disc-shaped nature to perpetuate control and deception. They claim NASA and equivalent organizations, such as the European Space Agency, systematically falsify satellite imagery, astronaut footage, and mission data—including the 1969 Apollo 11 Moon landing—to uphold the spherical model, with no actual space travel occurring beyond low altitudes due to technological barriers like radiation belts. This narrative frames agencies as purveyors of routine lies, exemplified by a 1985 statement from science advisor George A. Keyworth II describing NASA's habitual dishonesty.

Motives cited include vast financial extraction, with trillions of dollars allegedly diverted to fabricated programs like the International Space Station, enabling unchecked budgets under the guise of exploration. Ideological drivers feature prominently, particularly among religiously inclined adherents who argue the globe paradigm promotes atheism by aligning with evolutionary and Big Bang cosmologies that contradict literal biblical descriptions of a firmament-enclosed Earth. Eric Dubay, head of the International Flat Earth Research Society, contends in "Flat Earth FAQ" (2016) that the "tilting, wobbling, spinning space-ball" narrative deceives to foster a godless worldview, suppressing observational truths in favor of institutional dogma.

The 1959 Antarctic Treaty is invoked as evidence of suppression, purportedly barring civilians from exploring Antarctica's outer edges, depicted as an impenetrable ice wall encircling the flat plane and containing the oceans—access restrictions allegedly enforced to prevent discovery of infinite lands beyond or confirmation of no curvature. Proponents like those in the Flat Earth Society extend distrust to geopolitical strategy, claiming faked space achievements secure "control of space means control of the world," as articulated by Lyndon B. Johnson in 1958, prioritizing military dominance via illusions of orbital capabilities over shape revelation.

Broader institutional skepticism targets academia and media for uncritically enforcing globe orthodoxy, with forums like the Flat Earth Society's online community linking such conformity to eroded public trust in authority, amplified by perceptions of coordinated pseudoscientific propagation. These narratives portray the conspiracy as self-sustaining, where dissenters face marginalization, reinforcing belief in a systemic cover-up sustained by mutual complicity across institutions.

## Scientific Evidence for Spherical Earth

### Foundational Experiments and Measurements

In the 4th century BCE, Aristotle provided early empirical evidence for Earth's sphericity by observing lunar eclipses, noting that the shadow cast by Earth on the Moon consistently appeared as a circular arc regardless of the eclipse's timing or Earth's orientation.  This geometric consistency indicated that only a spherical body could produce such a uniform circular shadow from any angle, as opposed to a flat disk which would cast an elliptical or straight-edged shadow depending on its tilt. Aristotle's reasoning, grounded in direct observation, established a foundational qualitative proof of Earth's round shape, influencing subsequent Hellenistic astronomy.

Building on this, Eratosthenes conducted a quantitative measurement around 240 BCE to determine Earth's circumference, leveraging the spherical model. He observed that at noon on the summer solstice in Syene (modern Aswan), the Sun was directly overhead with no shadow in a deep well, while in Alexandria, approximately 800 kilometers north, a gnomon's shadow formed a 7.2-degree angle with the vertical.  Assuming parallel Sun rays, Eratosthenes calculated this angle as 1/50th of a full circle (360 degrees), estimating the full circumference at 250,000 stadia—equivalent to roughly 40,000 kilometers using the Egyptian stadion, within 2% of the modern value of 40,075 kilometers.  This experiment not only confirmed sphericity through geometric consistency but provided the first accurate large-scale measurement, relying on verifiable distances traveled by bematists (pace-counters) between the cities.

These ancient efforts laid the groundwork for later verifications, such as 19th-century surveys like the Bedford Level experiment, which aimed to test curvature but inadvertently supported sphericity by revealing expected water convexity when accounting for atmospheric refraction. The precision of Eratosthenes' result, derived from simple tools and first-principles geometry, underscores the robustness of spherical Earth models against alternative geometries, as discrepancies in shadow lengths and eclipse shadows would arise under non-spherical assumptions.

### Astronomical and Physical Proofs

The circular shadow cast by Earth on the Moon during lunar eclipses consistently appears round regardless of the eclipse's orientation, a phenomenon first noted by ancient observers and attributable solely to a spherical body, as a disk or other shape would produce varying shadow geometries depending on alignment. This has been documented in thousands of eclipses over millennia, with modern observations, such as the partial lunar eclipse on July 16, 2019, confirming the shadow's curvature aligns with a globe of approximately 12,742 km diameter.

Astronomical observations further reveal distinct celestial poles: in the Northern Hemisphere, stars trace counterclockwise circles around Polaris, visible up to about 1° from the north celestial pole, while in the Southern Hemisphere, stars rotate clockwise around the south celestial pole near Sigma Octantis, with constellations like the Southern Cross visible only south of the equator. These dual rotation centers, separated by roughly 23.5° due to Earth's axial tilt, require observers to be on opposite sides of a rotating sphere, as a flat plane could not support simultaneous polar rotations without violating uniform sky motion.

Physical evidence includes the progressive disappearance of ships over the horizon, where the hull vanishes below the waterline before masts due to Earth's curvature obscuring lower portions first, an effect observable with binoculars restoring visibility only up to the geometric horizon of about 4.8 km for a 1.8 m observer height. The Foucault pendulum, demonstrated publicly by Léon Foucault on January 8, 1851, at the Pantheon in Paris, exhibits a precession of its swing plane at 11.25° per hour—matching the sine of the latitude times Earth's 15°/hour sidereal rotation—providing direct mechanical evidence of planetary rotation consistent with a spherical Earth.

Gravity's uniform downward direction, measured via plumb bobs and accelerometers worldwide, aligns with acceleration toward a central mass on a sphere, yielding effective values from 9.780 m/s² at the equator to 9.832 m/s² at the poles due to combined gravitational and centrifugal effects; on a flat disk, plumb lines would radially converge toward the center, producing non-perpendicular "down" vectors at distances exceeding hundreds of kilometers from the hub, contradicting observed parallelism.

### Space Exploration and Direct Verification

Space exploration has provided direct visual confirmation of Earth's sphericity through photographs and observations from orbiting spacecraft and lunar missions. During the Apollo 8 mission on December 24, 1968, astronauts captured the iconic "Earthrise" image, showing Earth as a partially illuminated sphere rising over the lunar horizon, consistent with a round planet viewed from approximately 384,000 kilometers away. Subsequent Apollo missions, including Apollo 17 in December 1972, produced the "Blue Marble" photograph, depicting the fully illuminated Earth as an oblate spheroid with visible continents and oceans curving around its horizon. These images, taken by multiple cameras and corroborated by astronaut eyewitness accounts, demonstrate the planet's curvature and global form without reliance on composites or distortions.

The International Space Station (ISS), operational since November 1998 and orbiting at about 400 kilometers altitude, has enabled continuous human observation of Earth's curvature. Crew members have documented over 3.5 million photographs revealing the planet's rounded limb, atmospheric layers bending along the horizon, and rotational dynamics, such as 16 sunrises and sunsets per day due to orbital motion around a spherical body. More than 600 individuals have traveled to space as of 2022, with nearly all reporting the "overview effect"—a perceptual shift confirming Earth's spherical isolation in the void—without exception for a flat model. These low-Earth orbit views align with gravitational models predicting orbital paths only feasible around a massive, rotating sphere.

Unmanned satellites further verify sphericity through independent imagery from agencies worldwide. The Soviet Molniya 1-3 satellite captured the first full-disk Earth photograph on May 30, 1966, showing a rounded planet, followed by thousands of subsequent images from geostationary and polar-orbiting platforms like NASA's DSCOVR and Japan's Himawari-8, which provide real-time hemispheric views revealing consistent curvature and no edge or infinite plane.  These observations, processed without fish-eye distortion in raw data, underpin technologies like GPS, which require spherical geodesy for accurate positioning; deviations would yield positional errors exceeding observed precision by orders of magnitude. Flat Earth interpretations dismissing such evidence as fabricated overlook the interoperability of data across adversarial space programs, including Soviet, Chinese, and European missions, all converging on the same spherical geometry.

## Psychological and Sociological Dimensions

### Cognitive and Motivational Drivers

Belief in a flat Earth often stems from cognitive biases that prioritize personal intuition and selective evidence over comprehensive scientific data. Proponents frequently exhibit the Dunning-Kruger effect, demonstrating low scientific literacy yet high overconfidence in their understanding of cosmology and physics.  This metacognitive bias leads individuals to dismiss spherical Earth proofs, such as Eratosthenes' 240 BCE well experiment measuring Earth's curvature via shadow angles, as flawed or conspiratorial, while favoring anecdotal observations like the apparent flatness of horizons from ground level.

Confirmation bias further entrenches these views, as believers seek and interpret information—such as manipulated videos or misinterpreted flight paths—that aligns with a disc-shaped model, while ignoring contradictory data like lunar eclipses casting Earth's circular shadow or ships disappearing hull-first over the horizon due to curvature. Empirical analysis of YouTube exposure shows that lower science intelligence correlates with greater susceptibility to such flat Earth arguments, amplifying selective reinforcement in online environments. Illusory correlation may also play a role, where unrelated phenomena, like unchanged water levels in canals, are misconstrued as evidence against sphericity, disregarding gravitational principles that maintain equilibrium on a rotating globe.

Motivationally, flat Earth adherence frequently arises from deep-seated distrust of institutions, viewing organizations like NASA as perpetrating a global deception to maintain control or obscure religious truths. This conspiracy mentality, measured via scales assessing endorsement of secretive plots, predicts flat Earth belief independently of scientific knowledge deficits. For some, particularly those with literalist interpretations of religious texts like the Bible's references to "the circle of the earth" (Isaiah 40:22) or firmament domes (Genesis 1:6-8), adopting a flat model resolves cognitive dissonance between scripture and modern astronomy, preserving a geocentric worldview. A 2023 thesis analyzing predictors found Biblical literalism and conspiracy ideation as significant factors, with adherents reporting a sense of empowerment from uncovering supposed elite lies.

Additional drivers include a quest for community and identity within echo chambers, where rejecting mainstream consensus fosters belonging among like-minded skeptics. Life-narrative studies reveal that personal "awakenings" to flat Earth ideas often follow broader disillusionment with authority, such as skepticism toward vaccines or climate science, framing the belief as part of a rebellious pursuit of autonomy. However, these motivations do not alter empirical realities, such as satellite imagery from independent agencies confirming Earth's oblate spheroid shape or GPS functionality reliant on orbital mechanics.

### Community Structures and Belief Propagation

The modern Flat Earth movement features decentralized communities primarily structured around online forums, social media platforms, and periodic in-person conferences. The International Flat Earth Research Society, established by conspiracy theorist Eric Dubay in 2014, operates a dedicated forum that serves as a hub for discussion and resource sharing among adherents. Dubay, a yoga instructor known for his 2015 video compilation "200 Proofs Earth Is Not a Spinning Ball," which has garnered millions of views, exerts significant influence within these networks. Another prominent figure, Mark Sargent, has contributed through video series and appearances that emphasize empirical reinterpretations of observations, further solidifying informal leadership roles in the absence of hierarchical organizations.

In-person gatherings, such as the Flat Earth International Conference (FEIC), provide opportunities for networking and reinforcement of beliefs. The inaugural FEIC occurred on November 9-10, 2017, in Raleigh, North Carolina, drawing initial attendees to hear from key proponents. Subsequent events expanded, with the 2018 Denver conference registering over 600 participants, reflecting growth in community engagement despite the fringe nature of the ideology. These conferences feature presentations on alleged proofs, workshops, and vendor areas selling related merchandise, fostering a sense of collective identity among attendees who often cite institutional distrust as a unifying theme.

Belief propagation occurs predominantly via digital channels, with YouTube playing a pivotal role in amplification. Algorithms on the platform recommend Flat Earth content to users engaging with related conspiracy videos, leading to increased exposure; a 2019 study attributed the movement's resurgence partly to this mechanism, noting how initial curiosity videos escalate to more entrenched denialism. Channels operated by figures like Dubay and Sargent have accumulated substantial viewership, with Dubay's proofs video alone exceeding 1 million views by 2018, enabling rapid dissemination without reliance on traditional media. Social media platforms, including Facebook groups and Twitter (now X), facilitate real-time debates, meme sharing, and live streams that reinforce echo chambers, where dissenting evidence is dismissed as part of broader conspiracies involving governments and space agencies.

Survey data underscores the limited scale of these communities while highlighting persistence. A 2018 YouGov poll found approximately 4% of U.S. respondents believed the Earth is flat, with similar low figures in international samples. A 2022 nationwide survey reported around 10% agreement with Flat Earth claims among other conspiracies, correlating with lower trust in scientific institutions. Propagation thrives in online environments conducive to confirmation bias, where personal testimonies and selective experiments shared in closed groups sustain adherence despite empirical refutations elsewhere in the movement's broader context.

## Reception and Impact

### Educational Challenges and Responses

Educators encounter Flat Earth beliefs in classrooms, where students influenced by online content question established geophysical models despite curricula grounded in observations like ship hulls disappearing over horizons and lunar eclipse shadows. These challenges arise as beliefs persist among 1.3% to 10% of respondents in U.S. surveys conducted between 2018 and 2022, even among those exposed to secondary science education emphasizing spherical geometry and satellite imagery.

The persistence reflects broader science denial patterns, where proponents prioritize personal sensory experience—such as perceiving a flat horizon—over aggregated data from global measurements, including GPS triangulation and gravitational variations mapped by missions like GRACE since 2002. Institutional distrust exacerbates this, with Flat Earth advocates viewing textbooks and agencies like NASA as complicit in deception, a narrative amplified by social media algorithms favoring contrarian content over peer-reviewed syntheses. Surveys indicate higher endorsement among younger demographics, suggesting gaps in early instruction on evidentiary hierarchies.

Responses include fostering inquiry-based learning, where teachers guide students to test claims via replicable experiments, such as measuring shadow angles at distant locations to verify Eratosthenes' 240 BCE circumference calculation yielding approximately 40,000 km. Programs like those from the Harvard Graduate School of Education recommend modeling skepticism toward unverified sources while prioritizing falsifiable predictions, such as circumpolar star rotations observable in both hemispheres but incompatible with a disk model. In practice, middle school curricula in districts like Piedmont, Oklahoma, integrate counter-misinformation modules by 2020, using real-time data from weather balloons to demonstrate curvature at altitudes above 30 km.

Advanced interventions draw on cognitive psychology, addressing confirmation bias by requiring proponents to predict outcomes like time zone discrepancies—verifiable via synchronized clocks across longitudes—before exposure to discrepant evidence. A 2024 study on astronomy education found that targeted modules shifting from rote memorization to model-testing increased acceptance of sphericity from 72% to 92% among secondary students, measured pre- and post-intervention via concept inventories. Community efforts, including physics outreach since 2020, engage believers through public demonstrations of gyroscopic stabilization in aviation, which aligns with oblate spheroid dynamics rather than azimuthal equidistant projections favored by Flat Earth models. These strategies underscore empirical adjudication over authoritative fiat, mitigating recurrence by equipping learners with tools to evaluate claims against direct observables.

### Cultural, Media, and Public Critiques

The 2018 documentary *Behind the Curve*, directed by Daniel J. Clark, examines the modern Flat Earth movement through interviews and observations of believers, highlighting empirical failures such as a group's unsuccessful $20,000 laser gyroscope experiment intended to demonstrate the absence of Earth's curvature, which instead confirmed spherical geometry when results contradicted expectations. The film portrays adherents as earnest but self-deceived, with critics noting its role in illustrating cognitive dissonance rather than endorsing the theory, as evidenced by scenes where proponents reject disconfirming data.

Mainstream media outlets have frequently depicted Flat Earth advocacy as a symptom of broader anti-scientific conspiracism amplified by social platforms like YouTube, where algorithmic recommendations propel misleading content despite its empirical invalidity. Coverage in publications such as *The Guardian* (2018) and CNN (2019) frames conferences and public figures promoting the idea—such as basketball player Kyrie Irving's 2017 podcast comments questioning Earth's sphericity—as emblematic of distrust in institutions, often eliciting widespread ridicule and calls for scientific literacy over accommodation.  Irving faced public backlash, including NBA fines and peer debunkings, underscoring how such endorsements invite scrutiny of motivational factors like contrarianism rather than evidential merit.

Public surveys indicate Flat Earth belief remains marginal, with a 2022 Carsey School analysis finding approximately 10% of U.S. respondents agreeing or unsure about the claim, correlating with lower scientific knowledge and higher conspiratorial tendencies, while a 2018 YouGov poll estimated 4% outright belief but noted uncertainty among younger demographics up to one-third in some subgroups.  Critiques from physicists and educators, as in a 2020 *Physics World* article, advocate countering the theory through accessible demonstrations of curvature (e.g., lunar eclipses, ship horizons) rather than dismissal, arguing that engaging root causes like institutional skepticism yields better outcomes than mockery alone. Cultural references, including memes and satirical sketches, reinforce its status as a punchline for denialism, yet some analyses warn that oversimplifying believers as irrational overlooks social dynamics driving persistence in echo chambers.
