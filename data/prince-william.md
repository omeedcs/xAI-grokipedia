## Historical Background

Prince William was born at St Mary's Hospital in London, becoming the first direct heir to the British throne to be born in a hospital. His parents, then Prince Charles and Princess Diana, were one of the most-watched couples in the world, and William's early life was marked by intense public scrutiny. Following the tragic death of his mother in a car accident in Paris on August 31, 1997, when William was just 15, he and his younger brother, Prince Harry, became symbols of public mourning and resilience [The Guardian - Diana's Death](https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1997/sep/01/diana.monarchy).

William attended Eton College, a prestigious boarding school, from 1995 to 2000, where he excelled academically and in sports. He later enrolled at the University of St Andrews in Scotland, initially studying Art History before switching to Geography, earning a 2:1 degree in 2005. It was at St Andrews that he met Catherine Middleton, his future wife [Royal.uk Biography](https://www.royal.uk/duke-cambridge).

After university, William pursued a military career, training at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst and serving in the British Armed Forces from 2006 to 2013. He held roles in the Blues and Royals regiment, the Royal Air Force, and as a search-and-rescue pilot, demonstrating a commitment to public service [Ministry of Defence Archive](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/prince-william-ends-military-service).
