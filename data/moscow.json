Situated in western Russia along the Moskva River, it serves as the political, economic, cultural, and scientific center of the country. With a population of over 12.5 million as of recent estimates, Moscow is not only the most populous city in Russia but also in Europe [World Population Review](https://worldpopulationreview.com/world-cities/moscow-population). Known for its iconic architecture, such as the Kremlin and Red Square, Moscow is a global city that blends centuries of history with modern development.\n\n## Historical Background\n\nMoscow's history dates back to at least the 12th century, with its first recorded mention in 1147, when it was a small settlement in the Principality of Vladimir-Suzdal [Encyclopaedia Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/place/Moscow). Over time, it grew in importance due to its strategic location at the crossroads of trade routes.\n\n- **Medieval Period**: By the 13th century, Moscow became the center of a principality under Prince Daniel I. Despite being sacked by the Mongols in 1238 during the Mongol invasion, it recovered and emerged as a regional power. Under Ivan III in the late 15th century, Moscow became the capital of the Russian state, unifying surrounding territories and earning the title \"Third Rome\" after the fall of Constantinople [History.com](https://www.history.com/topics/russia/moscow).\n- **Imperial Era**: In 1547, Ivan IV (\"Ivan the Terrible\") was crowned the first Tsar of Russia in Moscow, solidifying its status. The city faced destruction again during the Time of Troubles (1598–1613) but rebounded under the Romanov dynasty. Peter the Great moved the capital to St. Petersburg in 1712, though Moscow retained cultural and economic significance [Russian Geographical Society](https://www.rgo.ru/en/article/moscow-history-and-modernity).\n- **Soviet Era**: Following the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, Moscow was reinstated as the capital in 1918. It became the heart of the Soviet Union, witnessing rapid industrialization and urbanization. Iconic structures like the Moscow Metro, opened in 1935, symbolized Soviet progress [Moscow Metro Official Site](https://www.mosmetro.ru/en/). The city also endured significant hardship during World War II, particularly during the Battle of Moscow (1941–1942), a turning point in the war against Nazi Germany [WW2 Database](https://ww2db.com/battle_spec.php?battle_id=54).\n- **Post-Soviet Transition**: After the dissolution of the USSR in 1991, Moscow adapted to a market economy, becoming a hub for business and international relations while grappling with inequality and infrastructure challenges [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/oct/03/moscow-post-soviet-transformation-25-years).\n\n## Current Status and Relevance\n\nToday, Moscow is the political and economic powerhouse of Russia. It hosts the Kremlin, the official residence of the President of Russia, and serves as the seat of the Russian government. The city is a major global financial center, home to numerous multinational corporations and the Moscow Exchange, one of the largest stock exchanges in Eastern Europe [Moscow Exchange](https://www.moex.com/en/).\n\n- **Economy**: Moscow accounts for a significant portion of Russia's GDP, driven by industries such as finance, technology, and energy. However, economic disparities between Moscow and other regions of Russia remain stark [World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/russia/publication/russia-economic-report).\n- **Culture and Education**: The city is a cultural hub, boasting world-renowned institutions like the Bolshoi Theatre and the Tretyakov Gallery. It is also home to Lomonosov Moscow State University, one of the leading academic institutions in Russia [MSU Official Site](https://www.msu.ru/en/).\n- **International Role**: Moscow plays a key role in global politics, often hosting international summits and negotiations. However, it has faced scrutiny and sanctions due to Russia's foreign policies, particularly following the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the ongoing conflict in Ukraine [BBC News](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-18005445).\n\n## Notable Facts and Details\n\n- **Population and Size**: Moscow spans over 2,511 square kilometers (970 square miles) and has a population density that makes it one of the most crowded cities in Europe. Its metropolitan area is home to over 17 million people [UN-Habitat](https://unhabitat.org/moscow-russia).\n- **Architecture**: The city is famous for landmarks like St. Basil’s Cathedral, with its colorful onion domes, and the Kremlin, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
