The Netherlands is bordered by Germany to the east, Belgium to the south, and the North Sea to the northwest, with maritime borders in the North Sea with the United Kingdom.

The Netherlands is a founding member of the European Union (EU), NATO, and the United Nations, playing a significant role in international diplomacy and trade. Its economy is highly developed, with key industries including agriculture, shipping, and technology. The name "Netherlands" literally means "low lands," reflecting the fact that much of the country lies below sea level, protected by an intricate system of dikes and polders [Netherlands Geography](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/destination/netherlands).

## Historical Background

The history of the Netherlands is marked by periods of prosperity, conflict, and innovation. The region was inhabited by Celtic and Germanic tribes before coming under Roman influence in the 1st century BCE. After the fall of the Roman Empire, the area was divided among various feudal states during the Middle Ages.

### Early Modern Period and the Dutch Golden Age
In the 16th century, the Netherlands became part of the Spanish Habsburg Empire, leading to tensions over religion and taxation. This culminated in the Eighty Years' War (1568–1648), during which the northern provinces declared independence, forming the Dutch Republic. The 17th century, often called the Dutch Golden Age, saw the Netherlands emerge as a global economic and cultural powerhouse. The Dutch East India Company (VOC) and West India Company (WIC) dominated global trade, establishing colonies in Asia, Africa, and the Americas. This era also produced iconic figures like painter Rembrandt van Rijn and philosopher Baruch Spinoza [Dutch Golden Age](https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2002/rembrandt-and-the-dutch-golden-age).

### Modern History
The Netherlands faced decline in the 18th century due to competition from Britain and France. It was occupied by Napoleonic France from 1795 to 1813 before becoming a kingdom under the House of Orange-Nassau. During the 20th century, the Netherlands remained neutral in World War I but was occupied by Nazi Germany from 1940 to 1945 during World War II, suffering significant loss and hardship. Post-war, the country rebuilt its economy and became a leader in European integration, co-founding the EU through the Treaty of Rome in 1957 [Netherlands History](https://www.history.com/topics/european-history/netherlands-history).

The Netherlands also decolonized after World War II, granting independence to Indonesia in 1949 and Suriname in 1975, though it retains ties with former territories like Aruba, Curaçao, and Sint Maarten, which are constituent countries within the Kingdom of the Netherlands [Decolonization in the Netherlands](https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/research/our-research/decolonization).
