## Historical Background

The origins of PepsiCo trace back to the late 19th century with the creation of Pepsi-Cola. In 1893, Caleb Bradham, a pharmacist from New Bern, North Carolina, developed a cola-flavored drink initially called "Brad’s Drink." It was renamed Pepsi-Cola in 1898, inspired by the word "dyspepsia," referring to indigestion, which the drink was marketed to relieve. Pepsi-Cola gained popularity in the early 20th century, but financial struggles led to multiple bankruptcies until it was acquired by Loft, Inc. in 1931 [History of Pepsi](https://www.history.com/news/pepsi-cola-inventor-caleb-bradham).

In 1965, Pepsi-Cola merged with Frito-Lay, a leading snack food company founded in 1932 by Herman Lay. This merger created PepsiCo, combining beverages and snacks under one corporate umbrella. The merger was a strategic move to diversify product offerings and compete more effectively with rivals like The Coca-Cola Company. Over the decades, PepsiCo expanded its portfolio through acquisitions, including Tropicana Products in 1998 and The Quaker Oats Company in 2001, adding juices and breakfast foods to its lineup [PepsiCo History](https://www.pepsico.com/who-we-are/about-pepsico/history).

During the late 20th century, PepsiCo became a cultural icon through its marketing campaigns, notably the "Pepsi Generation" advertisements of the 1960s and celebrity endorsements from figures like Michael Jackson and Beyoncé. The company also engaged in the infamous "Cola Wars" with Coca-Cola, a marketing rivalry that shaped consumer perceptions of both brands [Cola Wars Overview](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/012216/cola-wars-cok-vs-pep.asp).

## Current Status and Relevance

As of 2023, PepsiCo remains a dominant player in the global food and beverage industry, with reported net revenue of over $86 billion in 2022. The company employs approximately 315,000 people worldwide and operates through six key business segments: North America Beverages, Frito-Lay North America, Quaker Foods North America, Latin America, Europe, and Africa, Middle East, and South Asia [PepsiCo Annual Report 2022](https://www.pepsico.com/investors/financial-information/annual-reports-and-proxy-statements).

PepsiCo’s product portfolio includes 23 brands that each generate more than $1 billion in annual retail sales, such as Pepsi, Mountain Dew, Lay’s, Doritos, Cheetos, Gatorade, and Tropicana. The company has also focused on diversifying into healthier options, responding to consumer demand for low-calorie drinks and nutritious snacks through initiatives like reducing sodium and sugar content in its products [PepsiCo Sustainability](https://www.pepsico.com/sustainability/overview).

Sustainability is a core focus for PepsiCo, with its "PepsiCo Positive" (pep+ ) initiative aiming to create a more sustainable food system. Goals include achieving net-zero emissions by 2040, improving water-use efficiency, and promoting regenerative agriculture across its supply chain. However, the company has faced criticism for its environmental impact, particularly regarding plastic waste from packaging, and is under pressure to address these concerns [Environmental Impact Report](https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/pepsico-sets-net-zero-emissions-goal-by-2040-2021-01-14/).

PepsiCo is listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the ticker symbol PEP and is a component of the S&P 500 Index.
