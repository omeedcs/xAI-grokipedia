## Introduction

Moscow, the capital city of Russia, is one of the largest and most historically significant cities in the world. Situated in western Russia along the Moskva River, it serves as the political, economic, cultural, and scientific center of the country. With a population of over 12.5 million as of recent estimates, Moscow is not only the most populous city in Russia but also in Europe [World Population Review](https://worldpopulationreview.com/world-cities/moscow-population). Known for its iconic architecture, such as the Kremlin and Red Square, Moscow is a global city that blends centuries of history with modern development.

## Historical Background

Moscow's history dates back to at least the 12th century, with its first recorded mention in 1147, when it was a small settlement in the Principality of Vladimir-Suzdal [Encyclopaedia Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/place/Moscow). Over time, it grew in importance due to its strategic location at the crossroads of trade routes.

- **Medieval Period**: By the 13th century, Moscow became the center of a principality under Prince Daniel I. Despite being sacked by the Mongols in 1238 during the Mongol invasion, it recovered and emerged as a regional power. Under Ivan III in the late 15th century, Moscow became the capital of the Russian state, unifying surrounding territories and earning the title "Third Rome" after the fall of Constantinople [History.com](https://www.history.com/topics/russia/moscow).
- **Imperial Era**: In 1547, Ivan IV ("Ivan the Terrible") was crowned the first Tsar of Russia in Moscow, solidifying its status. The city faced destruction again during the Time of Troubles (1598–1613) but rebounded under the Romanov dynasty. Peter the Great moved the capital to St. Petersburg in 1712, though Moscow retained cultural and economic significance [Russian Geographical Society](https://www.rgo.ru/en/article/moscow-history-and-modernity).
- **Soviet Era**: Following the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, Moscow was reinstated as the capital in 1918. It became the heart of the Soviet Union, witnessing rapid industrialization and urbanization. Iconic structures like the Moscow Metro, opened in 1935, symbolized Soviet progress [Moscow Metro Official Site](https://www.mosmetro.ru/en/). The city also endured significant hardship during World War II, particularly during the Battle of Moscow (1941–1942), a turning point in the war against Nazi Germany [WW2 Database](https://ww2db.com/battle_spec.php?battle_id=54).
- **Post-Soviet Transition**: After the dissolution of the USSR in 1991, Moscow adapted to a market economy, becoming a hub for business and international relations while grappling with inequality and infrastructure challenges [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/oct/03/moscow-post-soviet-transformation-25-years).
