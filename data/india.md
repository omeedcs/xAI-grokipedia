## Overview
India, officially known as the Republic of India, is a sovereign nation in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by land area, spanning approximately 3.287 million square kilometers, and the second-most populous country in the world, with a population exceeding 1.4 billion as of 2023 [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/country/india). Bounded by the Indian Ocean to the south, the Arabian Sea to the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal to the southeast, India shares land borders with Pakistan, China, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, and Myanmar. Its capital is New Delhi, while other major cities include Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, and Bengaluru. India is renowned for its rich cultural heritage, diverse languages, religions, and traditions, often described as a "subcontinent" due to its vast geographical and cultural diversity [BBC India Profile](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-south-asia-12557384).

India operates as a federal parliamentary democratic republic, with a president as the head of state and a prime minister as the head of government. It is a founding member of several international organizations, including the United Nations, the Non-Aligned Movement, and the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC). The country’s economy is one of the fastest-growing in the world, with significant contributions from agriculture, information technology, and manufacturing [IMF India Report](https://www.imf.org/en/Countries/IND).

## Historical Background
India’s history is one of the oldest in the world, tracing back to the Indus Valley Civilization (circa 3300–1300 BCE), one of the earliest urban societies, centered in what is now modern-day Pakistan and northwest India [Encyclopedia Britannica - Indus Valley](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Indus-civilization). This civilization is noted for its advanced urban planning, writing system (yet undeciphered), and trade networks.

- **Ancient and Classical Periods**: Following the decline of the Indus Valley Civilization, the Vedic Period (circa 1500–500 BCE) emerged, during which the foundational texts of Hinduism, the Vedas, were composed. This era saw the rise of early kingdoms and the caste system. The Maurya Empire (321–185 BCE), under Emperor Ashoka, unified most of the Indian subcontinent and promoted Buddhism [History.com - Maurya Empire](https://www.history.com/topics/ancient-middle-east/maurya-empire). Later, the Gupta Empire (circa 320–550 CE) is often called the "Golden Age" of India due to advancements in science, mathematics (including the concept of zero), and arts.
- **Medieval Period**: From the 8th to 18th centuries, India saw the rise of regional kingdoms and the arrival of Islamic rulers, notably the Delhi Sultanate (1206–1526) and the Mughal Empire (1526–1857). The Mughals, under rulers like Akbar, contributed to architectural marvels such as the Taj Mahal and fostered a syncretic culture blending Persian, Indian, and Islamic influences [National Geographic - Mughal Empire](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/mughal-empire).
- **Colonial Era**: By the 18th century, European powers, particularly the British East India Company, gained control over large parts of India. Following the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the British Crown assumed direct rule, establishing the British Raj (1858–1947). This period saw economic exploitation, cultural suppression, and the rise of Indian nationalism, led by figures like Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru [BBC History - British Raj](https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/modern/independence1947_01.shtml).
- **Independence and Partition**: India gained independence from British rule on August 15, 1947, but the partition into India and Pakistan led to widespread violence and displacement. The partition was based on religious lines, with Pakistan created as a homeland for Muslims [Stanford History - Partition](https://web.stanford.edu/group/sjir/3.1.06_kumar.html).
