# Pope Francis

Pope Francis (Latin: *Franciscus*; born Jorge Mario Bergoglio; 17 December 1936 – 21 April 2025) was the 266th pope of the Catholic Church and sovereign of Vatican City, serving from his election on 13 March 2013 until his death at age 88 in the Vatican's Casa Santa Marta residence. Born in Buenos Aires to Italian immigrant parents, he was the first pope from the Americas, the first from the Southern Hemisphere, and the first Jesuit to lead the Church, selecting his name to evoke Saint Francis of Assisi's focus on poverty and creation.

His early career included studies in chemistry and philosophy before joining the Jesuits in 1958, ordination in 1969, and leadership roles such as provincial superior of Argentina's Jesuits from 1973 to 1979 and archbishop of Buenos Aires from 1998 to 2013, where he emphasized pastoral outreach amid economic crises. During his pontificate, Francis prioritized mercy, environmental stewardship via the encyclical *Laudato si'* (2015), and fraternity in *Fratelli tutti* (2020), while undertaking extensive travels to over 50 countries to promote dialogue and aid the marginalized.

Francis advanced synodality to involve laity in Church governance and reformed the Roman Curia, but his tenure drew criticism for perceived doctrinal ambiguities in documents like *Amoris Laetitia* (2016) on family life, restrictive policies on the traditional Latin Mass, a controversial agreement with China on bishop appointments, and slow responses to clerical sexual abuse scandals, exemplified by the case of former cardinal Theodore McCarrick. Financial mismanagement, including trials of cardinals like Angelo Becciu over Vatican investments, further highlighted governance challenges, contributing to internal divisions despite his emphasis on a "poor Church for the poor."

## Early Life and Formation

### Childhood in Argentina

Jorge Mario Bergoglio was born on December 17, 1936, in the Flores neighborhood of Buenos Aires, Argentina, the eldest child of Italian immigrants Mario José Bergoglio, an accountant employed by the railways, and Regina María Sívori, a homemaker. The family, which included four younger siblings—Alberto Horacio, Marta Regina, María Elena, and Óscar Adrián—resided in a modest single-family home in the working-class Flores district for Bergoglio's first 21 years. His parents' Piedmontese heritage shaped a devout Catholic household amid Argentina's wave of Italian migration.

Bergoglio's early education commenced at Escuela Primaria N°8 Cornelio Saavedra in Buenos Aires, followed by attendance at a Salesian-run institution, including a period at Don Bosco school from 1948 to 1949. He received his first communion at the Misericordia school, where nuns later recalled him as an ordinary boy rather than precociously saintly. Throughout his childhood and adolescence in Flores, Bergoglio engaged in typical porteño pastimes, such as playing soccer in the streets, while studying subjects including literature and chemistry.

By his teenage years, Bergoglio had completed secondary education, graduating as a chemical technician from a technical high school in Buenos Aires before briefly working in a laboratory. This formative period in a middle-class immigrant milieu instilled values of family loyalty and community solidarity that later influenced his worldview.

### Jesuit Vocation and Training

Jorge Mario Bergoglio entered the novitiate of the Society of Jesus on 11 March 1958 in Córdoba, Argentina, at the age of 21, after working as a chemical technician following his secondary education.  He completed his initial novitiate training and made his first vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience on 12 March 1960, formally becoming a Jesuit scholastic. 

As part of his formation, Bergoglio studied humanities in Santiago, Chile, from 1960 to 1963 before returning to Argentina to pursue a licentiate in philosophy at San Miguel Seminary.  During this period, he taught literature and psychology at the Colegio de San José in San Miguel from 1964 to 1966, and subsequently at the Colegio El Salvador in Buenos Aires in 1966. He then undertook theological studies at San Miguel from 1967 to 1970, earning a degree in theology. 

Bergoglio was ordained a priest on 13 December 1969 by Archbishop Ramón José Castellano in Buenos Aires, four days before his 33rd birthday.  Following ordination, he completed his tertianship—the third probationary year of Jesuit formation—at the University of Alcalá de Henares in Spain from 1970 to 1971.  Upon returning to Argentina in 1971, he taught theology at the Jesuit seminary in Buenos Aires until 1973, when he pronounced his final vows as a Jesuit on 22 April.  This completed the standard Jesuit formation path, emphasizing intellectual rigor, spiritual discipline, and apostolic work.

## Priestly and Episcopal Career in Argentina

### Early Ministry and Provincial Leadership

Following his ordination to the priesthood on December 13, 1969, by Archbishop Ramón José Castellano in Buenos Aires, Jorge Mario Bergoglio continued his Jesuit formation with studies at the University of Alcalá de Henares in Spain from 1970 to 1971. Upon returning to Argentina, he served in several educational and formative roles within the Society of Jesus, including as professor of theology at the Faculty of Theology in San Miguel.

From 1971 to 1973, Bergoglio acted as master of novices at Villa Barilari in San Miguel, guiding the initial formation of Jesuit candidates, and also served as a consultor to the Jesuit province.  He made his final profession as a Jesuit on April 22, 1973, affirming lifelong commitment to the order's vows of poverty, chastity, obedience, and special obedience to the pope regarding missions.

On July 31, 1973, at age 36, Bergoglio was appointed provincial superior of the Jesuits in Argentina, a position he held for six years until 1979, overseeing approximately 150 Jesuits across the province's communities, schools, and apostolates.  In this role, he emphasized fidelity to Jesuit constitutions, spiritual discipline, and alignment with papal directives amid internal debates over social engagement and political involvement in a period of national instability. His leadership involved reassigning members engaged in potentially divisive activism and prioritizing obedience to maintain the order's unity and mission focus.

### Archbishopric of Buenos Aires

Jorge Mario Bergoglio was appointed coadjutor archbishop of Buenos Aires on June 3, 1997, with the right of succession, and succeeded Antonio Cardinal Quarracino upon the latter's death, assuming the role of archbishop on February 28, 1998. He was installed in the position shortly thereafter and led the archdiocese, which served over three million inhabitants, until his election as pope in 2013.

As archbishop, Bergoglio prioritized a missionary initiative centered on fostering communion among clergy, religious, and laity while emphasizing evangelization tailored to the city's diverse social fabric. He restructured administrative offices, established new parishes to address population growth in peripheral areas, and encouraged priests and laypeople to conduct home visits across all neighborhoods as part of a re-evangelization effort. Bergoglio personally engaged in pastoral outreach, including weekly radio broadcasts, confirming and baptizing youth, and visiting AIDS hospices to care for the sick.

Bergoglio adopted a modest lifestyle, residing in a simple apartment at the archdiocesan offices rather than the episcopal palace, and frequently using public transportation. His ministry focused extensively on the marginalized, particularly residents of the city's slums (villas miseria), where he supported soup kitchens, educational programs, and direct aid initiatives, earning him the moniker "Slum Bishop" among locals. On February 21, 2001, Pope John Paul II elevated him to the cardinalate, after which he continued his duties as archbishop.

### Allegations During the Dirty War

During his tenure as provincial superior of the Jesuits in Argentina from 1973 to 1979, Jorge Bergoglio faced allegations of complicity or inaction amid the military junta's "Dirty War," a campaign of state terrorism from 1976 to 1983 that resulted in the disappearance of approximately 30,000 people suspected of leftist subversion. Critics, including human rights activists and journalist Horacio Verbitsky, accused Bergoglio of failing to protect priests engaged in social work in poor neighborhoods, which the regime viewed as guerrilla sympathy, and of prioritizing the Jesuit order's institutional survival over individual advocacy. Verbitsky, in his 2005 book *El Silencio*, claimed Bergoglio indirectly facilitated the regime's actions by withdrawing official Jesuit endorsement from certain priests, allegedly to appease military authorities, though no documentary evidence of direct denunciation has been produced.

The central incident involved Jesuit priests Orlando Yorio and Francisco Jalics, who were abducted on May 23, 1976, from the Buenos Aires slums where they ran a school and community center. Held and tortured for five months by naval forces under Admiral Emilio Massera, they were released on October 22, 1976, following interventions that included Vatican diplomatic pressure. Yorio later alleged in writings and interviews that Bergoglio had removed their residence status within the Jesuit order months prior, leaving them vulnerable, and failed to lobby aggressively for their freedom, possibly to distance the order from perceived Marxist influences in their work. Jalics initially echoed similar concerns but reconciled with Bergoglio in the 1990s, publicly stating in 2013 that he bore no responsibility for the kidnapping and that they had embraced during a meeting, attributing the abduction to regime suspicions rather than betrayal.

Bergoglio countered that he had repeatedly warned Yorio and Jalics against their slum activities due to escalating risks from both guerrillas and the military, and that the withdrawal of residence was disciplinary, not punitive, aimed at preventing broader Jesuit targeting. He detailed efforts to secure their release, including personal appeals to Massera, obtaining a papal intervention via Archbishop Antonio Quarracino, and providing safe houses post-liberation. In a 2013 interview, he described his decisions as "what I felt I had to do" to navigate the crisis without endangering more lives, emphasizing covert aid over public confrontation that could invite retaliation. Argentine courts investigating Dirty War crimes, including in 2010 testimony by Bergoglio, found no substantiation for complicity charges against him, though prosecutors noted his responses evaded some specifics.

Additional claims included Bergoglio's alleged reluctance to aid the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, such as Esther Ballestrino and Azucena Villaflor, who were disappeared in December 1977; critics asserted he knew their fates but did not intervene sufficiently, while supporters cited evidence of his assistance in relocating dissidents and falsifying documents to shelter over 1,000 individuals from regime persecution. The Vatican has consistently rejected complicity allegations as defamatory and ideologically driven, pointing to Bergoglio's quiet resistance amid a church hierarchy divided on confronting the junta. Verbitsky's accusations, while influential in left-leaning circles, have been critiqued for selective sourcing and alignment with Peronist critics of the church, lacking forensic proof of betrayal.

## Relations with Argentine Politics

### Interactions with de la Rúa Administration

As Archbishop of Buenos Aires from 1998 to 2013, Jorge Bergoglio maintained formal interactions with the administration of President Fernando de la Rúa (1999–2001), characterized by participation in state religious ceremonies and public commentary on the escalating economic crisis. De la Rúa, a devout Catholic, congratulated Bergoglio upon his elevation to cardinal on January 21, 2001, via contact from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Their encounters included joint appearances at the Te Deum mass on May 25, 2001, where de la Rúa attended alongside ministers as Bergoglio delivered the homily.

Bergoglio's homilies during this period increasingly critiqued the political and economic elite for failing to address widespread poverty and corruption, which the government noted as pointed warnings. On May 25, 2001, in the presence of de la Rúa and officials, Bergoglio emphasized moral failings in leadership amid rising unemployment and fiscal austerity measures. De la Rúa responded positively to such statements, describing Bergoglio as "a saint and a wise man" with whom he generally agreed, as stated after a June 2000 homily addressing social inequities.

As the 2001 crisis intensified—with bank restrictions (corralito) imposed in December limiting withdrawals to 250 pesos weekly—Bergoglio denounced politicians for exacerbating suffering through mismanagement, urging ethical governance over neoliberal policies. These remarks contributed to perceptions of the archbishop challenging the administration's moral authority, though no open rupture occurred before de la Rúa's resignation on December 20, 2001, amid riots and default. Additional meetings, such as in December 2000 via episcopal commissions, underscored routine ecclesiastical-state dialogue.

### Conflicts with Kirchner Governments

Tensions between Jorge Bergoglio, then Archbishop of Buenos Aires, and the Kirchner administrations emerged shortly after Néstor Kirchner's election as president in May 2003. Bergoglio publicly criticized the government's "exhibitionism and strident announcements," viewing them as prioritizing rhetoric over substantive action on poverty and social issues. In a May 2004 homily, he condemned policies that exacerbated inequality, prompting Néstor Kirchner to label Bergoglio the "spiritual leader of the opposition" and the "true leader of the opposition" to his administration.  

Economic disagreements intensified the rift, particularly over Néstor Kirchner's 2008 agricultural export tax hikes, which Bergoglio argued undermined farmers and contributed to economic instability while questioning the government's legitimacy in addressing Argentina's crises. The administration perceived Bergoglio as an adversary, leading to efforts to marginalize the Catholic Church's influence, including reported campaigns during the 2005 conclave where anti-Bergoglio materials were distributed to cardinals in Rome. 

Under Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, who succeeded her husband in 2007, conflicts escalated over social policies, culminating in the 2010 legalization of same-sex marriage. Bergoglio vehemently opposed the bill, describing it in a letter to Argentine monasteries as "an attempt to destroy God's plan" and equating it to threats against religious freedom and family structure.  The government advanced the law despite Church resistance, with Cristina's administration framing opposition as regressive, further straining relations as Bergoglio mobilized clergy and laity against what he saw as ideological imposition. These disputes highlighted Bergoglio's broader challenge to the Kirchners' moral authority on issues like human rights commissions that he accused of selective outrage.

### Stance Toward Milei

Prior to Javier Milei's election as president of Argentina on November 19, 2023, the economist-turned-politician had repeatedly denounced Pope Francis in vehement terms, labeling him an "imbecile," a "filthy leftist," and a "representative of the Evil One on Earth" for the pontiff's advocacy of social justice policies, which Milei equated with promotion of communism. Following the election, Francis telephoned Milei to offer congratulations and publicly downplayed the candidate's prior insults as typical campaign rhetoric, stating in a December 2023 interview that such comments were made "in jest" and expressing willingness to engage constructively.

The two men held their first in-person meeting on February 11, 2024, during Milei's attendance at the canonization Mass for Argentine nun María Antonia de San José, known as Mama Antula, in St. Peter's Square; a brief exchange occurred on the sidelines before a private audience lasting one hour and ten minutes the following day. Vatican statements described the discussions as cordial, covering topics of shared opposition such as abortion—where Milei aligned with Francis's pro-life stance—and potential cooperation on social issues, though ideological divergences on economics persisted. Francis's approach emphasized pragmatic dialogue over past animosities, with the pope later reflecting in interviews that he sought to build a "positive relationship" despite differences.

Tensions resurfaced in September 2024 amid protests over Milei's austerity measures, including cuts to pensions and public spending. On September 20, Francis addressed social movements at the Vatican, implicitly critiquing the administration's use of pepper spray and rubber bullets against demonstrators, remarking that governments appeared to "pay for pepper gas instead of social justice" and urging prioritization of the poor over repressive tactics. This reflected broader philosophical contrasts: Francis's encyclicals, such as *Laudato si'* and *Fratelli tutti*, have consistently warned against unchecked market liberalism exacerbating inequality, a worldview at odds with Milei's self-described anarcho-capitalism, which prioritizes deregulation and fiscal austerity to combat inflation—standing at over 200% annually upon his inauguration.

Despite these frictions, Francis maintained an openness to Milei's administration, avoiding blanket condemnations and focusing critiques on specific policies perceived as undermining human dignity. Argentine bishops, while expressing concerns over budget reductions affecting church-funded welfare, largely echoed the pope's restraint in state relations. No further public meetings occurred before Francis's death on April 21, 2025, but the pontiff's final interactions with Argentine politics underscored a pattern of conditional engagement, balancing ideological critique with pastoral outreach.

## Election to the Papacy

### 2013 Conclave and Selection

The 2013 papal conclave convened following the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI on February 28, 2013, the first such resignation since 1415. Cardinals under the age of 80, numbering 117 eligible electors from the College of Cardinals, were summoned to the Vatican, with 115 participating after two were absent due to health reasons. The conclave's secrecy oath emphasized isolation from external communication, with ballots burned after each round to produce smoke signals—black for inconclusive votes, white for election.

Voting commenced on March 12, 2013, in the Sistine Chapel, adhering to apostolic constitution *Universi Dominici Gregis*, which required a two-thirds supermajority for election—77 votes among the 115 electors. The first day saw two ballots, both yielding black smoke, indicating no candidate reached the threshold. On March 13, two more ballots in the morning again produced black smoke, reflecting divided preferences among frontrunners including Cardinals Angelo Scola and Marc Ouellet. The afternoon's fifth ballot, however, resulted in white smoke at approximately 7:06 p.m. local time, signaling the election of Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio, Archbishop of Buenos Aires.

Bergoglio, aged 76, accepted the election and chose the papal name Francis, honoring Saint Francis of Assisi for his emphasis on poverty and humility. French Cardinal Jean-Louis Tauran announced "*Habemus Papam*" from the central balcony of St. Peter's Basilica, introducing the new pontiff as the first pope from the Americas, the first Jesuit, and the first from the Southern Hemisphere since the 8th century. His selection marked a shift toward a non-European leader amid discussions on curial reform and evangelization in the Global South.

### Adoption of Name and Initial Gestures

Upon his election as pope on March 13, 2013, Jorge Mario Bergoglio announced his choice of the papal name Francis, the first pope to adopt this name in the history of the Catholic Church. He later explained to journalists on March 16, 2013, that the decision stemmed from a moment during the conclave when Cardinal Cláudio Hummes embraced him after the two-thirds vote threshold was reached, whispering, "Don't forget the poor." This prompted Bergoglio to think of Saint Francis of Assisi, whom he described as the "man of peace, who loves poverty... and who loved creation," signaling an intended focus on humility, care for the marginalized, and stewardship of the environment.  Vatican officials, including spokesman Thomas Rosica, interpreted the name as a tribute to the saint's identification with the poor, marking a departure from predecessors who typically chose names honoring earlier popes or apostles.

In his first public appearance that evening on the central balcony of St. Peter's Basilica, Pope Francis greeted the assembled crowd with unscripted words in Italian: "Brothers and sisters, good evening." He bowed his head for an extended period, requesting the people's prayers and blessing before imparting the traditional apostolic benediction _Urbi et Orbi_, an inversion of protocol that emphasized reciprocity and humility. This gesture, witnessed by tens of thousands in St. Peter's Square, contrasted with the more formal demeanor of recent popes and set a tone of simplicity, as he appeared without the red papal stole initially and spoke extemporaneously without notes.

The following day, March 14, 2013, Francis continued these signals of modesty by privately visiting the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore to pray at the tomb of Pope Pius V and offer Mass, forgoing the customary helicopter ride to the papal summer residence at Castel Gandolfo. Later, he returned to the Domus Sanctae Marthae guesthouse where cardinals had lodged during the conclave, personally retrieving his belongings and settling the bill in cash, declining assistance from aides—a rare act underscoring personal accountability and rejection of entitlement. These initial actions, reported by Vatican observers, reinforced perceptions of a papacy prioritizing frugality and accessibility over institutional pomp.

## Administrative Reforms and Governance

### Curial Restructuring

Upon his election in 2013, Pope Francis formed the Council of Cardinals, known as the C9, to assist in advising on the reform of the Roman Curia, the central administrative body of the Holy See. The council, comprising nine cardinals from various continents, held regular meetings to review the Curia's structure, emphasizing a shift toward missionary evangelization over bureaucratic rigidity. This effort built on preliminary changes, such as the creation of new dicasteries for Promoting Integral Human Development in 2016, Laity, Family, and Life in 2016, and Communication in 2015, which consolidated existing offices.

The cornerstone of the restructuring was the apostolic constitution *Praedicate Evangelium* ("Preach the Gospel"), promulgated on March 19, 2022, which superseded the 1988 constitution *Pastor Bonus* issued by Pope John Paul II.  The document, spanning 54 articles, reoriented the Curia explicitly toward service to the Pope's universal mission of evangelization, declaring that all dicasteries exist to support the Church's proclamation of the Gospel. It entered into force on June 5, 2022, institutionalizing reforms developed over nine years through consultations and draft iterations. 

Key structural changes included unifying all Curial departments under the term "dicasteries," eliminating the prior distinction between congregations (with doctrinal authority) and pontifical councils (advisory bodies), to foster parity and flexibility.  Leadership eligibility was broadened to include lay men and women, who could head dicasteries or serve as prefects without episcopal ordination, provided they possess requisite expertise; previously, such roles were reserved for clergy.  The constitution mandated term limits of five years for dicastery heads, renewable once, to prevent entrenchment and promote rotation. It also elevated the safeguarding of minors and vulnerable adults to a dedicated section within the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith, underscoring accountability in abuse prevention.

Additional provisions emphasized coordination among dicasteries to avoid silos, with the Secretariat of State retaining a coordinating role but stripped of some prior financial oversight transferred to the Economy Secretariat established in 2014. The reform aimed at "missionary conversion," requiring Curial personnel to prioritize proximity to local churches and cultural adaptation in governance, though critics noted limited substantive shifts in power distribution beyond nomenclature and eligibility rules.  By 2023, implementation included appointing lay leaders, such as women to high positions, signaling a departure from clerical monopoly in administration.

### Synodality Initiative

The Synodality Initiative, formally known as the Synod on Synodality, was launched by Pope Francis on October 9–10, 2021, in Rome under the theme "For a Synodal Church: Communion, Participation and Mission," aiming to cultivate a more participatory model of Church governance emphasizing listening to the Holy Spirit through dialogue among bishops, clergy, and laity. This process built on earlier reforms, including the 2018 apostolic constitution *Episcopalis communio*, which expanded synodal voting rights to non-bishops and formalized the Synod of Bishops as a permanent body for ecclesial discernment. Francis described synodality as an "inverted pyramid" structure where authority serves the base, prioritizing communal discernment over top-down decisions to address perceived clericalism and foster missionary outreach.

The initiative unfolded in three preparatory phases: diocesan consultations from October 2021 to August 2022 involving over 1,000 dioceses worldwide; national and regional syntheses; and continental assemblies from September 2022 to March 2023, which informed two global synod assemblies in Rome—October 4–29, 2023, and October 2–27, 2024—with approximately 364 participants each, including voting lay members for the first time. These gatherings produced working documents emphasizing co-responsibility, the role of women in decision-making, and reforms like updated seminary formation to integrate synodal practices, though proposals for ordaining women as deacons or altering priestly celibacy were rejected by majority vote in the final assembly.

The 155-paragraph Final Document, approved on October 26, 2024, by more than two-thirds of attendees and ratified by Francis without a follow-up exhortation, holds magisterial value and calls for ongoing implementation through local churches, including bishops' conferences discerning inculturated expressions of faith while maintaining doctrinal unity. A three-year implementation phase followed, approved in early 2025 and extending to a 2028 assembly, with Vatican guidelines issued on July 8, 2025, directing bishops to integrate synodal practices into parish life and governance.

Critics, including Cardinal Raymond Burke and Cardinal Gerhard Müller, argued the process risked eroding hierarchical authority by granting voting rights to non-bishops, potentially enabling unaccountable doctrinal shifts or regional variations that undermine universal Church unity, with Müller questioning its canonical validity due to lay participation. Proponents, aligned with Francis's vision, countered that it promotes authentic discernment rooted in Vatican II's collegiality, rejecting claims of radical overhaul as misinterpretations, though empirical participation data showed uneven global engagement, with some regions reporting low turnout amid concerns over ideological influences.

### Handling of Financial Institutions

Upon his election on March 13, 2013, Pope Francis promptly addressed longstanding concerns over the opacity and alleged improprieties in Vatican financial institutions, particularly the Institute for the Works of Religion (IOR), commonly known as the Vatican Bank, which had been implicated in money laundering and connections to organized crime in prior decades. He established the Pontifical Commission for Reference on the IOR on June 26, 2013, tasking it with evaluating the bank's purpose, transparency, and ethical standards, leading to the closure of approximately 5,000 accounts by 2014 deemed suspicious or non-compliant with banking norms. In parallel, Francis appointed new leadership, including Ernst von Freyberg as president of the IOR's Commission of Cardinals in 2013 and later Rolando Marranci as director in 2013, followed by further personnel changes to enforce stricter oversight.

To centralize and professionalize financial governance, Francis created the Council for the Economy on August 1, 2014, comprising eight cardinals and seven lay financial experts, and appointed Australian Cardinal George Pell as prefect of the newly formed Secretariat for the Economy, which oversaw budgeting and auditing across Vatican entities. This initiative culminated in the establishment of the Prefecture for the Economic Affairs of the Holy See, later restructured into the Dicastery for the Economy in 2021 via the motu proprio *Praedicate Evangelium*, aiming to integrate financial management under unified ethical and transparent protocols. Francis also promulgated laws enhancing compliance, such as the 2014 norms adopting international anti-money laundering standards, and a 2016 agreement with Italian authorities for automatic exchange of fiscal information, which facilitated the IOR's removal from the "grey list" of non-cooperative jurisdictions by the Council of Europe's MONEYVAL committee in 2017 after it passed 75% of assessed recommendations.

Despite these measures, financial scandals persisted, underscoring resistance within curial structures and incomplete implementation. A prominent case involved a 350-million-euro investment in a London property in 2013–2018, managed by the Secretariat of State, which resulted in losses exceeding 200 million euros due to alleged mismanagement and brokerage fees, leading to criminal trials commencing in July 2021 against figures including Cardinal Angelo Becciu, convicted in December 2023 on charges of embezzlement and fraud. In response, Francis issued a August 28, 2022, rescript mandating that all Holy See and Vatican City State financial assets be transferred to the IOR for management, aiming to curb decentralized dealings but criticized for concentrating power without fully resolving underlying deficits, which reached 83 million euros in 2023 amid pension shortfalls and off-books liabilities estimated over a billion euros.

Reforms yielded partial successes, such as the IOR reporting 33.2 million euros in net income for 2023 while managing 5.9 billion euros in assets under enhanced external audits, yet critics, including former insiders, argued that chronic opacity endured, with the Holy See's overall budget deficits ballooning and curial factions undermining accountability, as evidenced by Pell's 2017 demotion amid power struggles. Francis's approach emphasized moral imperatives over technocratic fixes, as articulated in his 2013 *Evangelii Gaudium* critique of economic idolatry, but empirical outcomes revealed persistent vulnerabilities, including mafia-linked historical ties not fully eradicated and a failure to achieve self-sustaining revenues independent of donor dependencies.

### Response to Clerical Sexual Abuse Scandals

Pope Francis established the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors in March 2014 to advise on safeguarding policies and best practices against clerical sexual abuse. The commission, chaired by Cardinal Sean O'Malley, aimed to promote global guidelines, though critics noted its advisory role lacked enforcement power and progress was slow in implementing universal reporting standards.

In August 2018, following the Pennsylvania grand jury report documenting over 300 priests abusing more than 1,000 victims since the 1940s, Francis issued a letter to the People of God expressing "shame and sorrow" for the Church's failures and calling for collective responsibility without specific new measures. He acknowledged systemic cover-ups but emphasized spiritual conversion over structural reforms, drawing criticism for not addressing episcopal accountability directly.

The February 2019 Vatican summit on the Protection of Minors, attended by bishops' conference presidents, produced 21 "reflection points" on prevention, formation, and victim support, but lacked binding outcomes, leading to accusations of performative action amid ongoing scandals. Francis defrocked former Cardinal Theodore McCarrick in February 2019 after a Vatican investigation confirmed abuse of minors and adults, though a 2020 report revealed prior popes and officials ignored allegations since the 1990s, with Francis receiving warnings in 2017 but initially lifting restrictions.

In May 2019, Francis promulgated *Vos estis lux mundi*, a motu proprio establishing universal norms for investigating abuse allegations, including mandatory reporting of bishops' cover-ups and procedures for complaints against clerics, effective June 2019. The document extended accountability to negligence in abuse cases and created timelines for investigations, but implementation varied by diocese, with survivors' groups reporting inconsistent enforcement and delays in high-profile probes. An updated version in March 2023 clarified procedures for vulnerable adults and extended bishop investigations beyond national borders.

Specific cases highlighted perceived inconsistencies: In 2017, Francis appointed Bishop Gustavo Zanchetta as assessor in the Vatican despite Argentine reports of his sexual misconduct with seminarians, leading to Zanchetta's 2022 conviction for abuse; Francis cited a 2015 medical diagnosis of Zanchetta's condition but accepted his resignation only in 2019 after renewed allegations. Critics, including former nuncio Carlo Maria Viganò, accused Francis of overlooking evidence in McCarrick's case and promoting abusers, claims the Vatican report partially attributed to incomplete prior documentation rather than deliberate cover-up.

Under Francis, the Vatican reported laicizing hundreds of priests annually for abuse—around 20-30 per year in the late 2010s per earlier data trends—but comprehensive statistics specific to his pontificate remain limited, with ongoing national inquiries (e.g., France's 2021 report of 216,000 victims since 1950) underscoring persistent failures in prevention. Survivor advocates argue responses prioritized institutional protection over zero-tolerance enforcement, citing insufficient defrockings relative to reported cases and reluctance to release full archives. In December 2019, Francis ended pontifical secrecy in abuse trials to facilitate civil reporting, a step toward transparency, though episcopal resignations for mishandling remain rare.

## Major Writings and Encyclicals

### Evangelii Gaudium and Evangelization

*Evangelii Gaudium*, the first apostolic exhortation of Pope Francis, was signed on November 24, 2013, during the Solemnity of Christ the King, and draws from the 2012 Synod of Bishops on the New Evangelization.  The 224-paragraph document urges a "new chapter of evangelization" centered on the joy of encountering Christ, rejecting a self-referential Church in favor of one that "goes out" to the peripheries.  Francis emphasizes the *kerygma*—the core proclamation of Christ's life, death, and resurrection—as the foundation for all pastoral activity, warning against reducing evangelization to mere doctrine or moralism without transformative encounter. 

The exhortation critiques structural obstacles to evangelization, including clericalism, which fosters a "spiritual worldliness" that prioritizes power over service, and calls for pastoral conversion involving better homilies, lay involvement, and openness to the Holy Spirit.  It advocates a relational, non-programmatic approach to mission, integrating social realities like poverty and exclusion, arguing that evangelization must address concrete human needs to proclaim the Gospel credibly.  Francis rejects "prosperity theology" and economic systems that idolize markets, such as "trickle-down" theories, which he claims aggravate inequality and undermine human dignity, though he clarifies these critiques target exclusionary ideologies rather than free markets per se. 

In terms of impact, *Evangelii Gaudium* has shaped Catholic evangelization by promoting a "missionary impulse" that prioritizes outreach to the marginalized and cultural engagement over internal preservation, influencing initiatives like World Youth Day emphases and synodal processes.  Reception has been mixed: praised for revitalizing missionary zeal and echoing Vatican II's call to holiness in action, but criticized by some for overemphasizing social issues at the expense of explicit salvation doctrine or for economic remarks perceived as populist.  Conservative outlets like *Crisis Magazine* noted tensions in its market critiques, while progressive voices highlighted its push for Church reform. Overall, it remains a cornerstone for Francis's vision of a dynamic, inclusive evangelization.

### Laudato Si' on Environment

Laudato Si', subtitled "On Care for Our Common Home," is the second encyclical issued by Pope Francis, dated May 24, 2015, and formally promulgated on June 18, 2015. Drawing its title from the opening words of Saint Francis of Assisi's *Canticle of the Creatures*, the document frames environmental stewardship as a moral imperative rooted in Christian theology, emphasizing humanity's role as caretakers of creation rather than exploiters. It integrates biblical references, such as Genesis's mandate to "till and keep" the garden, with critiques of contemporary ecological degradation, including pollution, climate change, biodiversity loss, and resource depletion.

The encyclical diagnoses the environmental crisis as interconnected with social injustices, arguing that the poor suffer disproportionately from ecological harm, such as contaminated water and extreme weather events exacerbated by human activity. Key themes include the rejection of a "technocratic paradigm" that prioritizes efficiency and profit over ethical limits, leading to consumerism and waste; the advocacy for "integral ecology," which holistically links environmental, economic, social, and cultural dimensions; and calls for personal and structural conversion, including simpler lifestyles, sustainable technologies, and international cooperation.  Francis critiques unfettered market mechanisms for failing to account for long-term ecological costs and urges policies like carbon pricing, reduced fossil fuel use, and protections for indigenous lands, while grounding these in a spiritual ecology that sees creation as reflecting divine wisdom.

Proposals emphasize dialogue among science, religion, business, and politics to foster ecological economics, with specific endorsements of renewable energy transitions and opposition to practices like rapid obsolescence in production. The document references scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate change, citing rising global temperatures (noted as approximately 1°C above pre-industrial levels at the time) and ocean acidification, but frames these within a theological anthropology rather than empirical modeling alone.

Reception varied, with environmental advocates praising its moral urgency and influence on global discourse, contributing to momentum ahead of the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement. Among Catholics, progressive sectors embraced its social dimensions, while traditionalists criticized it for perceived economic inaccuracies, such as undervaluing market incentives in poverty reduction, and for blurring theology with policy advocacy that assumes contested causal links in climate science without rigorous counterarguments.  Empirical impact includes institutional responses, like the establishment of a World Day of Prayer for the Care of Creation in 2015, but measurable shifts in emissions or policy adoption remain debated, with U.S. surveys indicating polarized views tied to political affiliations. 

### Fratelli Tutti and Social Teaching

*Fratelli Tutti*, promulgated by Pope Francis on October 3, 2020, at the tomb of St. Francis of Assisi, addresses the theme of universal fraternity and social friendship amid global challenges like pandemics, economic inequality, and political division. The encyclical, comprising eight chapters and 287 paragraphs, critiques a "closed world" marked by individualism, nationalism, and neoliberal economics that prioritize profit over people, drawing on the parable of the Good Samaritan as an icon for encountering strangers with compassion. It proposes an "open world" through solidarity, dialogue, and "political charity," urging reforms in migration policies via a fourfold approach of welcoming, protecting, promoting, and integrating migrants, while advocating for economic systems that ensure dignified work and prioritize the poor.

In the context of Catholic social teaching, *Fratelli Tutti* positions itself as a continuation of the tradition initiated by *Rerum Novarum* (1891), emphasizing the common good, subsidiarity, and solidarity, but with a stronger focus on global interdependence and interreligious collaboration, inspired partly by the 2019 Document on Human Fraternity co-signed with Grand Imam Ahmad Al-Tayyeb. Pope Francis calls for "a better kind of politics" that transcends ideological divides, rejects war as incompatible with fraternity, and subordinates the right to private property to the universal destination of goods, stating that such rights are provisional and must serve human needs. The document also reinforces opposition to the death penalty, aligning with Francis's 2018 revision of the Catechism declaring it inadmissible.

Critics from conservative Catholic perspectives have argued that *Fratelli Tutti* deviates from prior social teachings by underemphasizing subsidiarity—the principle favoring local solutions—and by exhibiting hostility toward market economies and private property without sufficient nuance, potentially echoing liberation theology influences. For instance, commentator Phil Lawler noted a "clear hostility toward private property, the market economy, and capitalism," contrasting it with teachings like those in *Centesimus Annus* (1991) that affirm capitalism's compatibility with ethics when regulated. Others, such as those at Catholic World Report, described it as containing "dubious claims, strawmen," and a lack of grounding in natural law or Gospel primacy, prioritizing political vision over doctrinal clarity. Despite such views, proponents within the tradition, including some theologians, maintain that its emphasis on fraternity renews core principles like the preferential option for the poor without contradicting subsidiarity, as local initiatives remain viable within global solidarity.

### Other Apostolic Exhortations

*Gaudete et exsultate*, issued on March 19, 2018, urges all baptized persons to seek holiness amid contemporary challenges, presenting the universal call to sanctity as attainable through small daily acts rather than heroic feats alone. The exhortation critiques modern distortions such as a self-centered spiritualism resembling Pelagianism, which overemphasizes human effort at the expense of divine grace, and intellectualism akin to Gnosticism, which prioritizes abstract knowledge over incarnational love. It integrates social justice with personal prayer, warning against both quietist individualism and activism detached from Christ, while proposing the Beatitudes and discernment as practical paths to growth.

*Christus vivit*, promulgated on March 25, 2019, and addressed particularly to young people following the 2018 Synod on Youth, Vocational Discernment, and the Discernment of Ruptures, affirms Christ's ongoing presence as a source of vitality and renewal. The document encourages youth to pursue authentic dreams, resist conformism to passing trends, and engage in spiritual accompaniment that fosters freedom rather than control, critiquing clericalism and overly institutional youth programs. It stresses the Church's role in intergenerational dialogue, vocational clarity, and missionary outreach, while addressing risks like digital isolation and ideological manipulation.

*Querida Amazonia*, released on February 2, 2020, after the 2019 Synod on the Amazon, outlines four interconnected "dreams" for the region's development: a social dream combating inequality and violence, a cultural dream safeguarding indigenous languages and traditions, an ecological dream advancing integral ecology per *Laudato si'*, and an ecclesial dream promoting creative evangelization through expanded lay ministries. Deliberately avoiding direct endorsement of ordaining married men or instituting female deacons—proposals debated in the synod—it prioritizes bolstering priestly formation and intercultural liturgical adaptations without compromising sacramental discipline. The text condemns extractive economies and calls for prophetic denunciation of injustices affecting Amazonian peoples.

*Laudate Deum*, dated October 4, 2023, serves as an urgent follow-up to *Laudato si'*, documenting insufficient global response to climate change despite scientific consensus on anthropogenic warming, with 2023 marking record temperatures and emissions. It denounces a technocratic mindset that treats nature as disposable, critiques inadequate political will and consumerist lifestyles, and advocates for international binding commitments, including reforms to multilateral institutions for equitable climate governance. The exhortation links environmental degradation to spiritual malaise, urging conversion toward simplicity and intergenerational solidarity.

## Doctrinal Positions and Controversies

### Amoris Laetitia and Family Issues

*Amoris Laetitia*, the post-synodal apostolic exhortation on love in the family, was signed by Pope Francis on March 19, 2016, and released on April 8, 2016, following the Ordinary Synod on the Family in October 2015 and the Extraordinary Synod in 2014. The 256-page document draws from synodal discussions to address contemporary challenges to marriage and family life, emphasizing pastoral accompaniment over rigid application of norms. It reaffirms core teachings on marriage's indissolubility, sacramental nature, openness to procreation, and the role of parents in child education, while critiquing cultural factors like individualism and consumerism that undermine family bonds.

The exhortation structures its reflections across nine chapters, beginning with biblical foundations of love from Scripture, such as 1 Corinthians 13, and proceeding to practical realities like spousal love, child-rearing, and societal support for families. Pope Francis highlights the family as a "domestic church" where faith is transmitted daily, urging mercy and gradual growth in holiness rather than unattainable ideals. It addresses issues including infertility, interfaith marriages, and the elderly's role, advocating for policies like parental leave and affordable housing to bolster family stability.

Chapter 8, "Towards a Better Process of Discernment," focuses on "irregular" situations, particularly divorced Catholics in civil remarriages without annulment. Footnote 351 suggests that after discernment with a priest, such individuals might receive absolution and Eucharist in specific cases where mitigating factors—like lack of full consent or subjective culpability—reduce grave sin, provided they resolve to live more faithfully over time. This approach contrasts with prior guidance, such as Pope St. John Paul II's *Familiaris Consortio* (1981), which barred such couples from Communion unless abstaining from sexual relations.

The exhortation sparked debate over whether it alters immutable doctrine on adultery's objective gravity or merely refines pastoral practice through conscience formation. In November 2016, four cardinals—Walter Brandmüller, Raymond Burke, Carlo Caffarra, and Joachim Meisner—submitted *dubia* (formal questions) seeking clarification on apparent contradictions with teachings like *Veritatis Splendor* (1993), including whether every sexual act outside valid marriage constitutes grave sin and bars sacraments absent repentance. Pope Francis did not respond directly, leading to public letters and a book, *Remaining in the Truth of Christ* (2014), by critics arguing the text introduces subjective moralism undermining objective norms.

Subsequent interpretations amplified divisions: the Argentine bishops' 2016 guidelines, approved by Pope Francis on September 4, 2017, permitted sacraments post-discernment if no continence is feasible; Malta's bishops in January 2017 similarly allowed Communion without abstinence requirements. In October 2023, the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith affirmed to Cardinal Dominik Duka that *Amoris Laetitia* enables sacramental access in particular circumstances, rejecting blanket exclusions. Defenders, including Jesuit scholars, view this as merciful development attuned to modern complexities, while opponents, citing unchanging magisterial precedents, contend it risks equating conscience with license, potentially eroding marriage's permanence. Mainstream outlets often frame critiques as ideological resistance, though primary texts reveal tensions between pastoral intent and doctrinal consistency.

### Traditionis Custodes and Liturgical Restrictions

On July 16, 2021, Pope Francis issued the apostolic letter *Traditionis Custodes* motu proprio, which restricted the celebration of the Roman liturgy according to the 1962 Missal, commonly known as the Traditional Latin Mass (TLM). The document revoked the broader permissions granted by Pope Benedict XVI's 2007 motu proprio *Summorum Pontificum*, which had allowed priests to celebrate the pre-conciliar rite freely as an "extraordinary form" of the Roman Rite. Francis declared the liturgical books promulgated by Paul VI (1969 Missal) and John Paul II (1988 revisions) to be the "unique expression" of the *lex orandi* (law of prayer) for the Roman Rite, aiming to foster ecclesial unity after observing that the prior liberalization had instead been exploited by some to widen rifts over Vatican II.

The motu proprio placed authority over TLM celebrations with diocesan bishops, requiring them to evaluate existing groups attached to the 1962 Missal and ensure participants do not reject the validity of the post-conciliar liturgy or the doctrinal authority of the Second Vatican Council. Key restrictions included prohibiting TLM in parish churches, banning the creation of new personal parishes dedicated to the old rite, and mandating that priests ordained after the document's date obtain explicit permission from the Dicastery for Divine Worship to use the 1962 Missal. Bishops were instructed to designate non-parish locations for permitted celebrations and to promote the Novus Ordo Missae in those communities as the ordinary form. In an accompanying letter to bishops, Francis cited a 2020 consultation by the Congregation for Divine Worship (now Dicastery), which reportedly revealed that *Summorum Pontificum* had not reconciled but rather polarized communities, with some using the TLM to question Vatican II's legitimacy.

On December 4, 2021, the Dicastery for Divine Worship issued *Responsa ad dubia*, providing negative responses to queries that further tightened implementation. It confirmed that TLM could not occur in parish churches even temporarily or for pastoral reasons, priests needed individual Vatican approval rather than blanket diocesan faculties, and celebrations were limited to non-Sunday or non-feast days unless no Novus Ordo was feasible; additionally, no new pro-indult groups could form, and existing ones required verification of orthodoxy. These clarifications emphasized the document's intent to suppress parallel liturgical structures, with the Dicastery stating that *Traditionis Custodes* sought a "single and identical prayer" in the Roman Rite to express unity.

Implementation varied among bishops: some, like those in the Diocese of Arlington, Virginia, received Vatican extensions for limited TLM sites until 2024, while others enforced stricter phase-outs. Traditionalist clergy and laity expressed opposition, arguing the restrictions undermined a rite with centuries of use and ignored evidence from the same consultation showing widespread attachment to the TLM without doctrinal rejection; leaked 2025 Vatican documents reportedly indicated that only a minority of bishops highlighted division, contradicting the official rationale of uniform concern. Critics, including figures in outlets like the National Catholic Register, contended that the policy exacerbated rather than healed divisions, as attendance at TLM grew post-*Summorum Pontificum* without widespread schism. Francis maintained the measures preserved tradition by centering it on Vatican II's reforms, dismissing claims of rupture.

### Fiducia Supplicans and LGBTQ Blessings

*Fiducia Supplicans*, a declaration issued by the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith on December 18, 2023, and bearing Pope Francis's specific approval, addresses the pastoral application of blessings within the Catholic Church. The document reaffirms the Church's unchanging doctrine that marriage is an exclusive, stable, and indissoluble union between one man and one woman, ordered toward the procreation and education of children, and explicitly prohibits any liturgical rite or blessing that could resemble or substitute for marriage. It distinguishes between formal liturgical blessings, which require moral perfection and cannot be granted to those in manifest grave sin, and informal, spontaneous pastoral blessings, which may be extended to individuals—including those in irregular situations or same-sex couples—who approach with a request for God's assistance in overcoming personal challenges. Such blessings, described as simple and non-ritualized, aim to invoke divine help for the persons involved without endorsing their relationship or implying approval of objectively sinful conduct.

The declaration's release sparked immediate and widespread controversy, with critics arguing that permitting priests to bless same-sex couples—even informally—risks public scandal, confuses the faithful about Church teaching, and undermines prior Vatican responses to similar inquiries, such as the 2021 *Responsum* from the same dicastery under Cardinal Luis Ladaria, which had denied the possibility of such blessings. Proponents, including the document's drafters, contended that it represents a development in pastoral practice rooted in Pope Francis's emphasis on mercy and accompaniment, allowing blessings as an expression of God's universal desire for salvation without altering doctrine. The text acknowledges potential for misinterpretation, urging priests to exercise prudence to avoid any appearance of ritual endorsement, yet its brevity and reliance on informal blessings were cited by detractors as insufficiently safeguarding against perceptions of equivocation on moral absolutes. 

Bishops' conferences worldwide issued varied responses, reflecting deep divisions. African episcopal bodies, including those in Ghana, Rwanda, Kenya, and the Symposium of Episcopal Conferences of Africa and Madagascar, rejected or severely restricted the application of blessings for same-sex couples, emphasizing cultural contexts where such actions could foster scandal or be equated with civil unions, and declaring on January 11, 2024, that "we, the Pastors of the Church in Africa... express our concern and dismay" while prioritizing fidelity to Scripture and Tradition over the declaration's pastoral innovations.  In contrast, some European conferences, such as the French after initial reservations from nine bishops, endorsed cautious implementation aligned with the document's intent. Over 50 countries saw public statements from Church leaders within weeks, with outright rejections in parts of Africa and Asia highlighting tensions between universal doctrine and local pastoral realities.

In response to the backlash, the Dicastery issued a press release on January 4, 2024, clarifying that episcopal reactions should not be seen as doctrinal opposition but as legitimate adaptations to cultural contexts, while insisting on the declaration's coherence with prior teaching and recommending its full reading to dispel misunderstandings. Pope Francis defended the approach in subsequent statements, including a February 2024 remark labeling critics as hypocritical for accepting blessings in other irregular contexts while objecting here, and a May 2024 interview reiterating that blessings target individuals seeking grace, not the unions themselves.  These clarifications notwithstanding, the document has exacerbated perceptions of theological ambiguity under Francis's pontificate, prompting ongoing debates among canonists and theologians about its consistency with the indissolubility of sacramental norms and the Church's historical prohibition on approving public sin. By late 2024, implementation remained uneven, with some dioceses prohibiting the blessings to preserve unity and avoid litigation risks in jurisdictions recognizing same-sex marriage.

### Abolition of Death Penalty Doctrine

In a letter dated August 1, 2018, from the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, approved by Pope Francis, the Catechism of the Catholic Church's paragraph 2267 was revised to declare that "the death penalty is inadmissible because it is an attack on the inviolability and dignity of the person." This change positioned the death penalty as intrinsically contrary to human dignity, building on prior papal emphases but escalating the Church's stance to categorical opposition, with the revision stating that the Church commits "to its abolition worldwide." The updated text acknowledged historical recourse to capital punishment by legitimate authority after a fair trial as once "considered an appropriate response to the gravity of certain crimes," but asserted that evolving societal conditions and fuller Gospel understanding rendered it now inadmissible.

Prior to this revision, the 1992 Catechism under Pope John Paul II had permitted the death penalty in narrow circumstances where it was "the only practicable way to defend the lives of human beings effectively from the unjust aggressor," reflecting longstanding Church tradition that included biblical precedents (e.g., Genesis 9:6) and theological support from figures like Thomas Aquinas, who viewed it as a means to protect the common good akin to amputating a diseased limb. John Paul II's 1995 encyclical *Evangelium Vitae* had already restricted its application, deeming it "practically unnecessary" in modern states with effective incarceration systems, a position echoed by Benedict XVI, yet without declaring it morally impermissible in principle. Francis's intervention, formalized on August 2, 2018, via rescript, thus marked a doctrinal shift presented as "authentic development" by the Vatican, though it lacked an explicit claim of infallibility.

The revision drew support from anti-death penalty advocates within the Church, who hailed it as aligning with Francis's broader mercy-focused theology and global campaigns, such as his 2015 address to the International Commission against the Death Penalty urging abolition as a step toward a "culture of life." However, it elicited significant criticism from traditionalist Catholics and theologians who argued it contradicted perennial magisterial teaching and natural law principles, potentially undermining the Church's authority on moral absolutes; figures like Cardinal Raymond Burke contended that it overstepped prudential judgments into doctrinal innovation, risking confusion over unchanging truths like the state's retributive role. Some canonists noted the change's reliance on contemporary conditions—such as advanced prisons—without addressing scenarios where such protections fail, as in failed states or during grave threats, echoing historical papal approvals of executions for heresy or treason. By 2023, the revision had influenced Catholic mobilization against capital punishment in policy debates, though debates persisted on whether it bound consciences absolutely or allowed dissent on non-infallible grounds.

### Agreement with China on Bishops

In September 2018, the Holy See and the People's Republic of China signed a provisional agreement aimed at resolving longstanding divisions in the Chinese Catholic Church by standardizing the process for appointing bishops.  The deal addressed the schism between the state-sanctioned Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association (CCPA), which operates without full Vatican recognition, and the underground Church loyal to Rome, where bishops had historically been appointed illicitly by Beijing without papal approval. Under the non-public terms, Chinese authorities propose candidates for episcopal sees, while the Pope retains veto power and final approval, with a joint Vatican-Chinese commission handling implementation.  Pope Francis described the accord as "the art of the possible" in diplomacy, emphasizing pastoral unity over diplomatic normalization, which remains absent due to China's insistence on no formal ties with Taiwan.

Implementation has yielded limited results, with approximately 10 new bishops ordained under the framework since 2018 and recognition granted to about 15 previously contested appointments, though progress stalled early with only six ordinations by 2022. The agreement, initially experimental for two years, has been renewed multiple times—on October 22, 2020, for another two years; in 2022 for two more; and on October 22, 2024, for four years—despite acknowledged violations by Chinese authorities.  Beijing has unilaterally installed bishops without prior Vatican consultation, including Shen Bin as auxiliary bishop of Shanghai in April 2023 (later promoted to ordinary and recognized by the Pope in July 2023) and John Peng Weizhao in Jiangxi in November 2022, prompting Vatican expressions of "surprise and regret" for breaching the pact.   Additional infractions include the forced transfer of Bishop Joseph Shen Bin to She Shan shrine in 2022 without Vatican input.

Critics, including Hong Kong Cardinal Joseph Zen and human rights organizations, contend the deal has legitimized CCP-controlled structures at the expense of underground Catholics, who face intensified persecution, arrests, and forced allegiance to the state apparatus.  Since 2018, several bishops and priests, such as Augustine Cui Tai of Xuanhua, have been detained or disappeared, with no evident improvement in religious freedom metrics; China's broader crackdown on unregistered worship has escalated under Xi Jinping's sinicization policies.  The Vatican has conceded violations but prioritized renewals to sustain dialogue, a stance decried as enabling Beijing's control while eliciting papal reticence on Chinese human rights abuses, contrasting with Francis's vocal advocacy elsewhere.  Independent analyses, drawing from on-ground reports rather than official Vatican optimism, indicate the accord has failed to unify the Church or curb state interference, instead fostering dependency on a regime with a track record of subverting religious autonomy. 

### Criticisms of Theological Ambiguity

Critics, including prominent cardinals and theologians, have argued that Pope Francis's teachings often exhibit theological ambiguity, failing to provide explicit affirmations or denials of longstanding Catholic doctrine, which they contend fosters confusion among the faithful and undermines doctrinal clarity. This criticism gained prominence following the 2016 publication of the apostolic exhortation *Amoris Laetitia*, where footnote 351 suggested discernment processes might allow access to sacraments for some divorced and civilly remarried Catholics, without specifying conditions that align unequivocally with prior teachings on the indissolubility of marriage.

In response, four cardinals—Walter Brandmüller, Raymond Leo Burke, Carlo Caffarra, and Joachim Meisner—submitted five *dubia* (formal yes/no questions) to Pope Francis on September 19, 2016, seeking clarification on whether *Amoris Laetitia* permitted interpretations contradicting doctrines such as the impossibility of absolving and absolving remarried persons without continence, or the existence of absolute moral norms. The questions were publicized on November 14, 2016, after no private response was received, with the cardinals warning that unresolved ambiguity could lead to "grievous harm" in pastoral practice. Pope Francis did not issue a direct yes/no reply, instead later criticizing public airing of *dubia* as rigid or ideologically motivated, which critics like Cardinal Burke interpreted as evading doctrinal precision.

Building on this, in September 2017, a group of 40 clergy and scholars, including professors and priests from 20 countries, issued a *Correctio Filialis*, a formal filial correction accusing Pope Francis of propagating seven heretical positions through *Amoris Laetitia*, such as implying that divine moral laws can be transgressed under certain circumstances without grave sin, or that pastoral discernment supersedes objective moral absolutes. The document invoked historical precedents like the correction of Pope Honorius I for ambiguous handling of monothelitism, arguing that such ambiguity enables heresy to spread unchecked. By October 2017, over 200 signatories had joined, emphasizing that the correction addressed perceived errors in propagation, not formal teaching, to urge clarification without challenging papal authority directly.

Further instances cited include off-the-cuff remarks, such as the 2013 in-flight comment "Who am I to judge?" regarding a homosexual priest, interpreted by some as softening Church teaching on homosexual acts, though the full context referenced unrepentant behavior. Theologians like Father Thomas Weinandy have contended that this pattern of imprecise language exacerbates division, with Pope Francis's responses to critics—dismissing them as "self-absorbed promethean neo-Pelagians"—failing to resolve underlying doctrinal tensions. In 2023, five cardinals resubmitted *dubia* on issues like female ordination and same-sex unions, receiving responses approved by Pope Francis that critics deemed evasive, prioritizing situational ethics over immutable truths. Defenders attribute such ambiguity to a pastoral emphasis on mercy, but opponents, including Bishop Athanasius Schneider, maintain it erodes fidelity to the magisterium by allowing divergent interpretations that contradict prior councils and encyclicals.

## Ecumenism and Interfaith Engagement

### Dialogue with Orthodox and Protestants

Pope Francis has pursued ecumenical dialogue with Eastern Orthodox churches, emphasizing personal encounters and joint statements on shared concerns such as Christian persecution and family values, though doctrinal differences like papal primacy persist without resolution. A landmark event occurred on February 12, 2016, when he met Patriarch Kirill of Moscow at Havana's José Martí International Airport, marking the first such papal-Russian Orthodox patriarchal encounter in nearly 1,000 years.  The resulting 30-point Joint Declaration affirmed the common apostolic faith, deplored secular attacks on marriage and the family, called for an end to Christian persecution in the Middle East, and urged cooperation against abortion and euthanasia, while acknowledging ongoing theological divergences.

Relations with the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople have featured regular meetings, including a May 25, 2014, joint declaration in Jerusalem commemorating the 1964 embrace of Pope Paul VI and Patriarch Athenagoras, where Francis and Bartholomew I reaffirmed commitment to unity through prayer and dialogue. Subsequent engagements include a September 17, 2019, private audience and lunch at the Vatican, and Francis's 2021 visits to Cyprus and Greece, where he addressed Orthodox audiences on mutual respect amid historical tensions.  The International Joint Commission for Theological Dialogue has continued under Francis, discussing synodality and primacy in 2023, though progress remains limited by Orthodox reservations on Catholic centralization.

In engagements with Protestant communities, Francis has prioritized relational gestures and apologies for historical Catholic actions, such as the Inquisition, while advocating shared witness on social issues like religious freedom and poverty. On July 9, 2014, he hosted U.S. televangelists Kenneth Copeland and James Robison at the Vatican, praying together and exchanging high-fives to symbolize goodwill, though he clarified no intent to proselytize. In December 2017, he met leaders of the World Evangelical Alliance to discuss persecution of Christians and inter-church cooperation. Further dialogues include a 2022 audience with a Protestant delegation preparing joint events in Poland and a September 2023 "Together" gathering in Rome uniting Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant figures for prayer against division.  These initiatives have drawn Protestant appreciation for humility but criticism for perceived doctrinal ambiguity, particularly on sacraments and authority, with no formal agreements on Eucharistic sharing or unity.

### Document on Human Fraternity

The Document on Human Fraternity for World Peace and Living Together was signed on February 4, 2019, during Pope Francis's apostolic journey to the United Arab Emirates, by Francis and Ahmed el-Tayeb, the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar University in Cairo. The signing occurred at a public interreligious event in Abu Dhabi attended by approximately 1,200 religious leaders from various faiths, marking the first papal visit to the Arabian Peninsula. The document, drafted over a year through discussions between the signatories, aims to foster peace amid global conflicts, emphasizing shared human dignity and rejecting violence justified by religion.

In its eight sections, the text declares that all humans are created equal by God with rights to life, security, and freedom from discrimination based on religion, ethnicity, or other traits. It condemns terrorism, extremism, and forced conversions, attributing such acts to distortions of religious teachings rather than authentic faith, and calls for religious leaders to promote dialogue, education for tolerance, and protection of vulnerable groups including migrants and the poor. A pivotal assertion states: "The pluralism and the diversity of religions, color, sex, race and language are willed by God in His wisdom, in which God created human beings," framing religious diversity as part of divine intent alongside human differences. The signatories urge governments and international bodies to enact laws safeguarding religious freedom, family structures, and interfaith cooperation to prevent societal fragmentation.

The document's release prompted the United Nations General Assembly to designate February 4 as the International Day of Human Fraternity in 2020, with subsequent Vatican initiatives including a Higher Committee for Human Fraternity to implement its principles through education and advocacy. It influenced Pope Francis's 2020 encyclical *Fratelli Tutti*, which expands on fraternity as a response to individualism and inequality.

Among Catholic theologians and traditionalists, the document has faced criticism for potentially endorsing religious relativism, particularly through the claim that God wills religious pluralism, which some interpret as contradicting doctrines like *extra ecclesiam nulla salus* (no salvation outside the Church) affirmed in councils such as Vatican I. Critics, including outlets aligned with pre-Vatican II perspectives, argue it implies false religions are divinely ordained rather than tolerated for greater goods like civil peace, echoing historical papal condemnations of indifferentism in documents like *Mirari Vos* (1832). Defenders, including Vatican officials, maintain it addresses practical coexistence without negating doctrinal differences, focusing on natural law and shared opposition to violence. The phrase on religious diversity has been cited in debates over whether it aligns with Catholic teaching on the unique salvific role of Christ, with some viewing it as ambiguous amid broader concerns of theological imprecision in Francis's interfaith outreach.

### Relations with Islam and Judaism

Pope Francis has pursued interfaith dialogue with Muslim leaders, notably through multiple meetings with Ahmed el-Tayyeb, the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar University. Their first significant encounter occurred on May 28, 2016, at the Vatican, marking a resumption of ties after a period of estrangement initiated in 2011 over perceived papal insults to Islam. This was followed by the signing of the *Document on Human Fraternity for World Peace and Living Together* on February 4, 2019, in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, during Francis's apostolic visit—the first by a pope to the Arabian Peninsula. The document, co-authored by Francis and el-Tayyeb, condemns violence in the name of religion, affirms human dignity across faiths, and calls for cooperation against extremism, though critics have noted its lack of explicit condemnation of specific Islamic doctrines on apostasy or jihad.

Further engagements included a 2021 visit to Iraq, where Francis addressed a Muslim-Christian gathering in Ur and condemned ISIS's genocide against minorities, emphasizing shared Abrahamic roots while urging rejection of religious violence. In November 2022, during his trip to Bahrain, Francis again met el-Tayyeb, reinforcing commitments to peace amid regional conflicts. These efforts have been praised for breaking stereotypes and fostering practical solidarity, such as joint condemnations of terrorism, but some observers argue they prioritize gesture over doctrinal clarity, potentially overlooking empirical patterns of religiously motivated violence in Muslim-majority contexts.

Relations with Judaism have featured personal ties from Francis's Argentine years, including a longstanding friendship with Rabbi Abraham Skorka, with whom he co-authored *On Heaven and Earth* in 2010, discussing ethical overlaps between faiths. As pope, he visited Israel in May 2014, meeting the two chief rabbis, praying at the Western Wall, and touring Yad Vashem, where he described the Holocaust as "the fruit of the closing of the heart to God and humanity's selfishness." In January 2016, Francis became the third pope to visit Rome's Great Synagogue, affirming the Catholic Church's recognition of the Jewish people's "irrevocable" covenant with God and condemning antisemitism as a "sin against God." He also oversaw the 2020 opening of Vatican archives on Pius XII, facilitating scholarly access to Holocaust-era documents amid debates over papal wartime actions.

However, tensions arose from specific statements, such as an August 2021 general audience remark that the Torah "does not give life" and represents an incomplete promise fulfilled only in Christ, which Jewish leaders like Rabbi David Rosen of the American Jewish Committee viewed as reverting to supersessionist theology despite post-*Nostra Aetate* progress. Following the October 7, 2023, Hamas attacks on Israel, Francis's calls for a ceasefire and references to Gaza resembling "genocide" drew rebukes from groups including B'nai B'rith and the International Jewish Committee for Interreligious Consultations, who argued his rhetoric failed to distinguish between aggressor and defender, potentially fueling antisemitism amid rising global incidents. Despite repeated condemnations of antisemitism—over 50 public statements by 2023—critics contend his emphasis on Palestinian solidarity and reluctance to unequivocally label Hamas's actions as terrorism strained relations, reflecting influences from Global South perspectives where anti-Zionism often intersects with anti-Jewish sentiment.

## International Diplomacy and Conflicts

### Cuba-U.S. Normalization

Pope Francis facilitated the normalization of diplomatic relations between the United States and Cuba, culminating in a joint announcement by Presidents Barack Obama and Raúl Castro on December 17, 2014, which included the release of American contractor Alan Gross from Cuban imprisonment and plans to reopen embassies in each other's capitals. The effort built on secret talks initiated in June 2013 under Obama's authorization, with the Vatican providing neutral ground for high-level meetings, including a session in October 2014 that helped finalize the agreement.

Francis personally intervened by sending letters to Obama and Castro in the months leading up to the announcement, appealing for resolution of humanitarian concerns and an end to decades of enmity dating back to the 1960 U.S. embargo. Obama had raised the Cuba issue during a March 27, 2014, meeting with Francis at the Vatican, where the pope committed to aiding the process. Both leaders publicly thanked Francis for his mediation upon the deal's unveiling, crediting his appeals with bridging gaps in the protracted negotiations.

The agreement led to the restoration of full diplomatic ties by July 2015, easing travel and trade restrictions though the core embargo persisted until subsequent policy shifts. Francis reinforced the thaw during his September 19–22, 2015, visit to Cuba, where he met Castro, addressed crowds in Havana and Holguín, and described the U.S.-Cuba reconciliation as a constructive model for resolving global conflicts amid calls for continued progress on human rights and economic reforms. While the pontiff's diplomacy marked a Vatican success in quiet negotiation—echoing prior papal outreach under John Paul II and Benedict XVI—observers noted limited immediate advances in Cuban political liberalization, with the regime maintaining control over dissent.

### Israeli-Palestinian and Middle East Efforts

Pope Francis conducted a pilgrimage to the Holy Land from May 24 to 26, 2014, beginning in Amman, Jordan, where he met with refugees and celebrated Mass at the Amman International Stadium attended by over 45,000 people. He then proceeded to Bethlehem in the West Bank, meeting Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and addressing the separation barrier, emphasizing peace and reconciliation. In Jerusalem, he prayed at the Western Wall, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, and other sites sacred to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, urging an end to divisions.

During the visit, Francis invited Israeli President Shimon Peres and Palestinian President Abbas to the Vatican for a prayer summit, which occurred on June 8, 2014, in the Vatican Gardens. The event featured interreligious prayers by Jewish, Christian, and Muslim leaders, followed by remarks from the presidents and the joint planting of an olive tree as a symbol of peace; Peres and Abbas exchanged kisses on the cheek at the conclusion. Francis described the gathering as a gesture of courage amid ongoing conflict, though it yielded no formal diplomatic breakthroughs.

Throughout his pontificate, Francis consistently advocated a two-state solution, stating in 2023 that it was necessary to end the Israel-Hamas war and enable two peoples to live in dignity. He reiterated this position in April 2024, praying for Palestine and Israel to become "two states, free and with good relations," and affirmed Palestinian statehood as the "only solution" in January 2025 following a ceasefire.

In response to the October 7, 2023, Hamas attacks on Israel, which killed approximately 1,200 people and resulted in over 250 hostages, Francis condemned the "terrorism" and "barbaric" acts, calling for the immediate release of captives unharmed. He expressed concern for Gaza civilians early in the ensuing war, urging humanitarian corridors and aid access. As Israeli operations continued, with over 40,000 Palestinian deaths reported by Gaza health authorities, Francis escalated criticism, labeling the enclave a "graveyard," airstrikes as "cruelty" that exceeded morality, and the humanitarian crisis "shameful" by January 2025. On November 17, 2024, he publicly called for investigation into genocide allegations against Israel in Gaza, a first for him on the issue. These statements strained Vatican-Israeli relations, with Israel viewing them as disproportionately focused on its actions despite Hamas's use of civilian areas for military purposes.

In his final public address on April 21, 2025, hours before his death, Francis again demanded a ceasefire on all Middle East fronts, hostage release, and pursuit of peace paths, while decrying the war's "barbarity." Broader Middle East efforts included his 2021 Iraq visit, where he met Shiite leader Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani to promote Christian-Muslim coexistence amid ISIS devastation, and repeated appeals for ceasefires in Syria and Lebanon conflicts tied to regional stability.

### Russia-Ukraine War Position

Pope Francis responded to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, by condemning the aggression and repeatedly calling for an immediate ceasefire and diplomatic negotiations to end the conflict. In his March 6, 2022, Angelus address, he explicitly named "the Russian Federation" as responsible for the "sacrilegious war" and decried the violence against civilians, while urging world leaders to prioritize peace over escalation. Throughout 2022 and 2023, he issued numerous appeals, including during his June 13, 2022, message for the World Day of the Poor, where he highlighted the war's exacerbation of global poverty and famine, attributing it to the invasion's disruptions. He also facilitated humanitarian efforts, such as Vatican aid corridors and prisoner exchanges, and met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on multiple occasions, including their fourth encounter on October 11, 2024, to discuss repatriation of captives and ongoing support.

However, Francis's statements included suggestions of external factors contributing to the war's outbreak, diverging from predominant Western narratives of unprovoked Russian imperialism. In a May 2022 interview, he posited that NATO's eastward expansion constituted "barking at the gates of Russia," potentially provoking the invasion, and questioned whether other nations had encouraged Ukraine to provoke Moscow. Similarly, in June 2022, he described the conflict as "perhaps somehow either provoked or not prevented," linking it to NATO's post-Cold War enlargement without sufficient dialogue with Russia. These remarks echoed realist critiques of NATO's role in heightening tensions, though they drew accusations of false equivalence from Ukrainian officials and Western commentators, who viewed them as diluting Russia's accountability. Francis maintained a balanced diplomatic approach, meeting Russia's new ambassador Ivan Soltanovsky in September 2023 and dispatching peace envoy Cardinal Matteo Zuppi to Moscow in October 2023 to address humanitarian issues, while rejecting any religious justification for the war in a December 2024 statement.

A notable escalation in controversy occurred in a March 2024 interview with Swiss broadcaster RSI, where Francis advised Ukraine to demonstrate the "courage of the white flag" by initiating negotiations with Russia, framing it as a strategic concession to halt bloodshed rather than outright defeat, with the pope offering Vatican mediation. This elicited sharp rebukes from Kyiv, with Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba asserting Ukraine would "never raise the white flag," and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg disagreeing that surrender was viable. Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin clarified that the call was for mediated talks, not capitulation, aligning with Francis's consistent pacifism that prioritized de-escalation over arming Ukraine, which he implicitly critiqued by opposing weapons shipments that prolong suffering. Overall, his stance reflected a causal emphasis on negotiation to resolve geopolitical flashpoints, informed by historical Vatican wariness of great-power proxy conflicts, though it fueled perceptions of moral ambiguity amid Russia's documented atrocities.

### Migration Policies and Refugee Advocacy

Pope Francis prioritized advocacy for migrants and refugees from the outset of his papacy, framing their plight as a moral imperative rooted in Christian hospitality and condemning what he termed the "globalization of indifference" toward human suffering at borders. His first trip outside Rome on July 8, 2013, was to the Italian island of Lampedusa, a key entry point for African migrants crossing the Mediterranean, where he presided over a Mass for recently arrived asylum seekers and cast a wreath into the sea in memory of those who drowned in perilous journeys. In his homily, Francis highlighted the deaths of migrants in boats that shifted from symbols of hope to vehicles of death, urging global responsibility amid reports of over 15,000 fatalities in Mediterranean crossings since the early 1990s up to that point.

Subsequent actions reinforced this focus, including his April 16, 2016, visit to the Greek island of Lesbos amid the European migrant crisis, where he met refugees fleeing Syria and war zones; he personally arranged for the resettlement of 12 Muslim asylum seekers—three families including six children—facing deportation back to Turkey under a EU-Turkey deal. In 2017, Francis addressed an international forum on migration and peace, outlining 20 action points for responses to forced displacement, emphasizing safe legal pathways, family reunification, and countering human trafficking while acknowledging states' duties to ensure public order. He integrated migrant advocacy into Vatican structures by creating, in 2016, a migrants and refugees section within the Dicastery for Promoting Integral Human Development, which coordinated Church efforts globally and promoted integration over mere humanitarian aid.

Francis repeatedly critiqued physical and policy barriers to migration, stating on April 1, 2019, that "builders of walls, be they made of razor wire or bricks, will end up becoming prisoners of the walls they build," positioning such measures as contrary to bridge-building and encounter. This stance aligned with annual World Day of Migrants and Refugees messages, such as his 2023 emphasis on systemic causes like conflict and poverty driving over 110 million displaced persons worldwide by then, calling for shared responsibility among nations rather than unilateral rejection. In a February 11, 2025, letter to U.S. bishops amid debates on border enforcement, he warned that policies relying on force over truth and dignity "will end badly," advocating solidarity and protection for migrants while critiquing narratives that dehumanize them, though Catholic doctrine simultaneously upholds states' rights to regulate inflows for security and welfare.

His advocacy drew praise from humanitarian groups for elevating migrant voices but faced internal Church criticism for underemphasizing integration challenges, cultural assimilation, and fiscal burdens on receiving societies—evident in rising anti-immigrant sentiments across Europe and the U.S. during his tenure, where migrant inflows strained resources amid terror incidents linked to unchecked entries. Francis maintained that fear-driven closures exacerbate suffering without addressing root causes like failed governance in origin countries, consistently urging Catholics to view migrants not as threats but as bearing Christ's presence, even as Vatican security protocols remained stringent.

### Other Global Interventions

In September 2018, the Holy See and the People's Republic of China signed a provisional agreement allowing for consultation between the Vatican and Beijing on the appointment of Catholic bishops in China, aiming to resolve the schism between the state-sanctioned Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association and the underground church loyal to Rome. The deal granted the pope final approval over candidates proposed by Chinese authorities, leading to the ordination of approximately 10 new bishops under Pope Francis's pontificate, including Bishop Francis Xavier Wei Zhong of Lüliang on January 23, 2025. Extended for two years in 2020 and 2022, and for four more years on October 22, 2024, the agreement drew criticism from human rights organizations and some Catholic leaders for conceding undue influence to the Chinese Communist Party, potentially enabling state control over the church and overlooking religious persecution, as Beijing continued to propose candidates aligned with party loyalty rather than doctrinal fidelity. 

Pope Francis engaged in diplomatic efforts to address Venezuela's political and humanitarian crisis, meeting President Nicolás Maduro on October 24, 2016, to urge alleviation of public suffering amid economic collapse and shortages. In February 2019, he expressed willingness to mediate if both the government and opposition consented, dispatching Vatican diplomats to facilitate talks, though he emphasized that negotiations must be serious and not merely performative. These initiatives, building on earlier Vatican mediation attempts requested by Maduro, ultimately stalled due to unmet conditions for genuine dialogue, prompting the Holy See to withdraw direct involvement by late 2019, amid ongoing repression and failure to achieve a breakthrough despite appeals for justice centered on human rights. 

On climate change, Pope Francis pursued global influence through his June 18, 2015, encyclical *Laudato Si'*, which critiqued environmental degradation as a moral crisis disproportionately affecting the poor and contributed to momentum for the Paris Agreement adopted on December 12, 2015, by framing ecological stewardship as integral to Catholic social teaching.  He advocated for international action in addresses to world leaders, including a 2015 speech to the United Nations, and in his October 4, 2023, apostolic exhortation *Laudate Deum*, which rebuked insufficient progress on emissions reductions and fossil fuel dependency. The Holy See committed to climate neutrality by 2050, announced in 2020, aligning Vatican efforts with the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, though critics noted that Francis's emphasis on systemic causes sometimes overlooked empirical debates over policy efficacy and economic impacts on developing nations. 

In Africa and Asia, Francis's interventions included elevating local church leadership and fostering dialogue, such as appointing cardinals from peripheral dioceses to decentralize governance, and conducting apostolic visits like to South Sudan in 2023 to promote peace amid civil strife, though these yielded limited tangible diplomatic resolutions compared to his Latin American roots.  His broader approach emphasized "diplomacy of hope" in annual addresses to the diplomatic corps, prioritizing truth and forgiveness over power politics, independent of Western alliances.

## Canonizations, Appointments, and Rituals

### Key Canonizations and Beatifications

Pope Francis canonized 942 saints between 2013 and his death in 2025, a figure that includes large collectives of martyrs such as the 813 Martyrs of Otranto on May 12, 2013, and emphasizes witnesses from modern eras across continents. This volume exceeds that of his immediate predecessors and prioritizes laypeople, missionaries, and victims of persecution over predominantly clerical or ancient figures.

Prominent individual canonizations include Popes John XXIII and John Paul II on April 27, 2014, the first simultaneous elevation of two pontiffs to sainthood, drawing massive crowds to Vatican City and symbolizing continuity between the Second Vatican Council and its implementation. Mother Teresa of Calcutta was canonized on September 4, 2016, acknowledging her direct aid to the destitute in India and global founding of the Missionaries of Charity. On October 14, 2018, Pope Paul VI and Archbishop Óscar Romero were declared saints; Romero, assassinated in 1980 amid El Salvador's civil strife, was recognized for his denunciations of violence against civilians, though some critics contended his pastoral stance blurred lines with political activism.

Later ceremonies featured diverse modern saints, such as the 10 canonized on May 15, 2022, including Carmelite Titus Brandsma, killed in Dachau for opposing Nazi ideology, and the 14 on October 20, 2024, comprising Franciscan friars martyred in Syria for refusing conversion to Islam. John Henry Newman, the 19th-century convert and intellectual, was canonized on October 13, 2019, underscoring themes of conscience and doctrinal development.

In beatifications, Pope Francis approved 1,541 declarations, including Venerable John Paul I on September 4, 2022, based on a miracle involving a Chilean girl's recovery, and Carlo Acutis on October 10, 2020, a teenage Italian who used digital media for catechesis and whose intercession led to verified healings. These acts advanced causes for figures embodying mercy and innovation, with Acutis's path culminating in canonization authorization before Francis's death.

### Consistorial Creations of Cardinals

Pope Francis convened ten consistories to elevate clergy to the cardinalate between 2014 and 2024, appointing a total of 163 cardinals from 76 countries, including 25 nations previously unrepresented in the College of Cardinals. These elevations prioritized pastoral leaders from mission territories, religious orders, and geographic peripheries outside Europe, reflecting Francis's emphasis on a "synodal" and missionary Church structure over traditional curial or European dominance. By the time of his death, cardinals created by Francis constituted approximately 80% of those eligible to vote in a conclave (under age 80), numbering 110 out of 140. This shift diversified the electorate: of the 95 voting-age cardinals appointed from 2014 to 2022, 41% were European compared to higher proportions under predecessors, with increased representation from Asia (e.g., 13% in some cohorts) and Africa.

The consistories often aligned with broader pontifical initiatives, such as the Year of Mercy (2015-2016) or post-synodal reflections, and included non-bishops or curial officials to balance expertise. Notable patterns included elevating 55 religious order members across the appointments, spanning over 20 institutes, and occasional honors for over-80-year-olds ineligible for conclaves to recognize service without altering voting dynamics. Critics from conservative sectors argued this approach diluted doctrinal uniformity in favor of pastoral diversity, potentially influencing future papal elections toward progressive peripheries, though empirical data on conclave outcomes remains speculative until tested.

| Date | Number Created | Key Notes |
|------|----------------|-----------|
| 22 February 2014 | 19 | First consistory; emphasized developing world, including first cardinals from Nicaragua, Haiti, and Myanmar. |
| 14 February 2015 | 20 | Timed near Year of Mercy launch; included African and Asian appointees to reflect global demographics. |
| 28 June 2018 | 14 | Focused on curial reformers and Latin American sees. |
| 5 October 2019 | 13 | Post-Amazon Synod; elevated indigenous advocates and Pacific representatives. |
| 28 November 2020 | 13 | Pandemic-era; included Vatican diplomats and non-electors over 80. |
| 27 August 2022 | 20 | Expanded to small nations like Singapore and Timor-Leste. |
| 30 September 2023 | 21 | Highlighted U.S.-born curial head Robert Prevost and French bishops; 17 countries represented. |
| 7 December 2024 | 21 | Final consistory; from 16-17 nations, including Tehran and Tokyo archbishops; 20 electors, underscoring unity amid Francis's health decline. |

These appointments ensured the College mirrored Catholicism's demographic reality—over 70% non-European—while maintaining a functional size under canon law limits (120 electors ideal, though exceeded). Empirical tracking shows Francis's selections correlated with higher attendance from Global South regions in synods, causal to his vision of decentralized governance, though source analyses from Vatican-aligned media may overstate harmony versus underlying tensions reported in independent outlets.

### Year of Mercy and Jubilee 2025

Pope Francis proclaimed an Extraordinary Jubilee Year dedicated to mercy on March 13, 2015, formalized through the bull *Misericordiae Vultus* issued on April 11, 2015. This Holy Year ran from December 8, 2015—the Solemnity of the Immaculate Conception—to November 20, 2016—the Solemnity of Christ the King—emphasizing God's mercy as central to the Gospel message. Key elements included the opening of Holy Doors at the four major papal basilicas in Rome, starting with St. Peter's Basilica on December 8, 2015, and the dispatch of Missionaries of Mercy—priests granted faculties to absolve even reserved sins—to promote confession and forgiveness worldwide. Indulgences were available to pilgrims passing through Holy Doors or fulfilling conditions like prayer and almsgiving, aiming to foster concrete acts of mercy such as visiting the sick or imprisoned.

The Year of Mercy concluded with the apostolic letter *Misericordia et Misera* on November 20, 2016, which extended certain concessions like expanded confession faculties and established the third Sunday of Advent as a day for Scripture reflection to sustain mercy's emphasis beyond the Jubilee. This initiative reflected Francis's pastoral focus on mercy as a bridge for evangelization, drawing over 20 million pilgrims to Rome and inspiring local Holy Doors globally, though critics noted potential dilution of doctrinal rigor in favor of experiential outreach.

Building on this tradition of special Jubilees, Pope Francis announced the Ordinary Jubilee of 2025 via the bull *Spes non confundit* on May 9, 2024, themed "Pilgrims of Hope" to counter contemporary despair with renewed trust in divine providence. The Holy Year commenced on December 24, 2024, with Francis opening the Holy Door of St. Peter's Basilica, followed by doors at St. John Lateran on December 29, 2024; St. Mary Major on January 1, 2025; and St. Paul Outside the Walls on January 5, 2025. It extends to January 6, 2026, featuring themed events such as the Jubilee of Youth (July 28–August 3, 2025), Jubilee of Workers (May 1–4, 2025), and opportunities for plenary indulgences through pilgrimage, penance, and charity. Expected to draw tens of millions, the event underscores hope's role in renewal, echoing mercy's relational emphasis while addressing global challenges like conflict and secularism.

## Health Decline and Death

### Chronic Illnesses and Hospitalizations

Pope Francis underwent a partial resection of his right lung in 1957 at age 21 due to a severe respiratory infection, which left him with chronic breathing difficulties that persisted throughout his life. This early intervention contributed to recurring pulmonary vulnerabilities, exacerbated by his age and demanding schedule, leading to frequent respiratory infections in later years.

In addition to respiratory challenges, Francis developed chronic knee pain and mobility limitations, requiring the use of a cane, walker, and eventually a wheelchair by 2022, attributed to osteoarthritis and sciatica. These issues intensified after 2022, with the pontiff undergoing physical therapy and limiting public appearances to manage pain, though he continued pastoral duties from seated positions.

Major hospitalizations included a 10-day stay at Rome's Gemelli Hospital from July 4 to 14, 2021, for surgical resection of half his colon due to symptomatic diverticulitis and narrowing of the large intestine. In March 2023, he was admitted briefly for treatment of acute bronchitis, receiving intravenous antibiotics before discharge. June 2023 brought another procedure at Gemelli for abdominal hernia repair, involving nine days of hospitalization and subsequent recovery that temporarily halted international travel.

Recurring health episodes marked 2024 and early 2025, including a bout of influenza and bronchitis in February 2024 that canceled audiences, followed by falls in December 2024 (bruised chin) and January 2025 (arm injury). These compounded his chronic conditions, with Vatican statements noting persistent respiratory fragility and emerging signs of renal strain. Despite these, Francis maintained a rigorous calendar until acute exacerbations necessitated further intervention in February 2025.

### Final Days and Death on April 21, 2025

In the weeks leading up to Easter 2025, Pope Francis continued to recover from a prolonged hospitalization for double pneumonia, having been discharged from Rome's Gemelli Hospital on March 23 after approximately 38 days of treatment. Despite medical advice recommending two months of rest following the episode, which included early-stage kidney insufficiency and ongoing respiratory challenges stemming from a partial lung removal in 1957, he resumed limited duties at the Vatican's Casa Santa Marta residence. 

On Easter Sunday, April 20, 2025, Francis made his final public appearance, delivering the traditional *Urbi et Orbi* blessing from the loggia of St. Peter's Basilica and greeting crowds in St. Peter's Square, an effort that underscored his determination to fulfill pastoral responsibilities amid frailty. This appearance followed his convalescence, during which Vatican updates noted slight health improvements but persistent vulnerabilities, including a history of bronchitis and infections that had prompted event cancellations earlier in the year.

Francis's health deteriorated suddenly on the morning of Easter Monday, April 21, 2025, beginning around 05:30 CEST with symptoms leading to a stroke, followed by coma and irreversible cardiocirculatory collapse due to heart failure.  He died at 88 years of age later that morning at Casa Santa Marta, with the Vatican confirming the passing through Cardinal Kevin Farrell, camerlengo, at approximately 9:45 AM. In his final hours, reports indicated he expressed gratitude for the opportunity to return to public view and continued light work against medical counsel, reflecting a pattern of resilience observed throughout his papacy. 

## Legacy and Reception

### Achievements in Mercy and Outreach

Pope Francis emphasized mercy through personal acts symbolizing service to the marginalized, notably by expanding the traditional Holy Thursday foot-washing ritual to include women, non-Christians, and prisoners, departing from precedents limited to men in Roman prisons. On March 28, 2013, shortly after his election, he washed and kissed the feet of 12 young detainees at Rome's Casal del Marmo juvenile prison, including two women and two Muslims, underscoring humility and outreach beyond Catholic confines.  He repeated this in subsequent years, such as at Paliano prison on March 29, 2018, where he served 12 inmates including non-Italians, and at Velletri prison on April 18, 2019, for 12 prisoners from four nations.  In 2024, he washed the feet of 12 women inmates at a Rome facility, eliciting emotional responses from participants.

His outreach extended to direct visits with the impoverished and incarcerated, aiming to embody corporal works of mercy like visiting the imprisoned and sheltering the homeless. On July 25, 2013, during World Youth Day in Brazil, Francis visited the Varginha favela in Rio de Janeiro, a notorious slum, where he prayed with residents and condemned violence while urging community solidarity. In the United States, on September 27, 2015, he addressed and met inmates at Curran-Fromhold Correctional Facility in Philadelphia, advocating rehabilitation over mere punishment and highlighting systemic issues in incarceration. These engagements sought to humanize the suffering, aligning with his calls for the Church to prioritize peripheries.

Doctrinally, Francis promoted mercy via apostolic exhortations and letters, such as *Misericordia et misera* on November 20, 2016, which extended priests' faculties to absolve the sin of procured abortion indefinitely, framing mercy as transformative forgiveness accessible to penitents showing conversion.  He also dispatched Missionaries of Mercy in 2016 to emphasize confession and absolution, reinforcing sacramental outreach. In a September 1, 2016, message for the World Day of Prayer for the Care of Creation, he proposed adding "care for our common home" as an eighth corporal work of mercy, linking environmental stewardship to traditional acts like feeding the hungry, though this innovation drew debate over diluting scriptural foundations.  Such initiatives positioned mercy as active love addressing contemporary vulnerabilities, though critics argued they risked conflating spiritual charity with policy advocacy.

### Conservative Critiques and Doctrinal Divisions

Conservative Catholics have criticized Pope Francis for introducing doctrinal ambiguity, particularly in areas of marriage, sexuality, and liturgy, arguing that his teachings undermine traditional moral absolutes and foster confusion among the faithful. These critiques often center on documents like *Amoris Laetitia* (2016), which in Chapter 8 suggests a process of discernment allowing some divorced and civilly remarried Catholics to receive Holy Communion under certain circumstances, interpreted by opponents as contradicting the Church's longstanding prohibition on admitting those in objective states of adultery to the sacraments.  This position prompted five dubia (formal questions seeking clarification) submitted by Cardinals Raymond Burke, Walter Brandmüller, Carlo Caffarra, and Joachim Meisner in September 2016, querying whether *Amoris Laetitia* permits exceptions to absolute moral norms; Francis did not provide a direct response, leading critics to accuse him of evading accountability and exacerbating division.

Further divisions arose with *Fiducia Supplicans* (December 2023), a declaration by the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith—approved by Francis—permitting priests to offer non-liturgical blessings to same-sex couples and others in irregular unions, while reaffirming that such unions cannot be blessed as such. Conservatives, including bishops in Africa and figures like Cardinal Gerhard Müller, condemned it as a de facto endorsement of sinful relationships, arguing it blurs the distinction between approbation and pastoral accompaniment, erodes the Church's witness against homosexual acts, and invites scandal despite disclaimers preserving doctrinal orthodoxy on marriage.   The document's aftermath saw widespread resistance, with numerous bishops' conferences rejecting its implementation, highlighting a rift between Roman directives and local episcopal authority.

Liturgical restrictions under *Traditionis Custodes* (July 2021) intensified conservative opposition, as the motu proprio revoked permissions from Benedict XVI's *Summorum Pontificum* (2007), mandating that the Traditional Latin Mass (1962 Missal) be celebrated only with explicit diocesan approval and subordinating it to the Novus Ordo as the "unique expression" of the Roman Rite. Critics, including Cardinal Burke and canon lawyers, viewed this as an authoritarian suppression of a legitimate liturgical tradition that fosters reverence and doctrinal clarity, punishing faithful attached to it without evidence of widespread abuse, and motivated more by ideological disdain for pre-conciliar forms than unity concerns; implementation varied, with many bishops delaying or minimizing enforcement amid surveys revealing minimal division from the older rite.  

The 2019 Amazon Synod provoked accusations of syncretism when statues depicting pregnant indigenous figures—later termed "Pachamama" by Francis—were venerated in Vatican Gardens ceremonies and placed in Santa Maria in Trastevere church, prompting their removal and disposal in the Tiber River by protesters. Francis publicly apologized for the act of removal on October 25, 2019, confirming the figures' identity as Pachamama and their return for synod use, which conservatives like Bishop Athanasius Schneider decried as tolerating pagan idolatry in sacred spaces, violating the First Commandment and signaling a relativistic openness to non-Christian elements under the guise of inculturation.  

These episodes contributed to broader doctrinal fractures, including a 2017 filial correction signed by over 60 scholars alleging heresy in Francis's teachings on marriage and a rise in "recognize and resist" postures among laity and clergy, who affirm papal authority but withhold assent to perceived errors. Appointments of cardinals and bishops favoring progressive views, alongside perceived leniency in clerical abuse cases like that of Theodore McCarrick (laicized in 2019 after mishandling critiques), reinforced claims of a pontificate prioritizing pastoral pragmatism over immutable doctrine, deepening schismatic tendencies without formal schism. 

### Broader Impact and Public Image

Pope Francis cultivated a public image centered on humility, accessibility, and direct engagement with the faithful and marginalized, often forgoing traditional papal pomp in favor of simpler attire and personal interactions, such as washing the feet of prisoners and refugees during Holy Week rituals. Surveys indicated sustained high favorability among global Catholics, with at least 80% of U.S. Catholics expressing positive views in multiple Pew Research Center polls from 2013 onward.  His emphasis on mercy and outreach resonated particularly in developing regions, though overall U.S. approval fluctuated, peaking at around 70% in 2015-2017 before declining amid political polarization.

The pontiff's image became increasingly polarized, with liberals and progressives viewing him favorably for perceived openness on social issues—78% of very liberal Americans rated him as a good or great pope—while conservatives criticized his approach as fostering doctrinal ambiguity, such as in interpretations of *Amoris Laetitia* (2016) permitting Communion for some remarried divorcees and restrictions on the Traditional Latin Mass via *Traditionis Custodes* (2021).  Among U.S. Republican-leaning Catholics, the share deeming him "too liberal" rose from 23% in 2015 to 55% by 2018, reflecting tensions over his critiques of market capitalism and clericalism. Conservative factions, including figures like Cardinals Raymond Burke and Robert Sarah, argued his synodal process risked diluting orthodoxy, though Francis dismissed such opposition as a "suicidal attitude" clinging to unadaptable traditions. 

On global issues, Francis exerted influence through *Laudato Si'* (2015), which framed environmental stewardship as a moral imperative tied to human dignity, shaping discourse ahead of the Paris Agreement and prompting world leaders to address anthropogenic climate impacts.  His advocacy for migrants—visiting Lampedusa in 2013 and decrying "globalization of indifference"—challenged restrictive policies, as in his 2025 letter to U.S. bishops warning that force-based migration approaches "will end badly," while facilitating diplomatic breakthroughs like the 2014 U.S.-Cuba thaw.  In interfaith relations, he advanced Christian-Muslim ties via the 2019 Document on Human Fraternity with Grand Imam Ahmed Al-Tayyeb, fostering peace initiatives in the Middle East and beyond, earning praise from religious leaders for prioritizing dialogue over confrontation.  These efforts positioned the Vatican as a moral voice on inequality, technology, and fraternity, though critics contended they sometimes prioritized geopolitical accommodation over doctrinal clarity.
