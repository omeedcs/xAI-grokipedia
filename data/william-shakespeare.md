William Shakespeare (baptized April 26, 1564 – April 23, 1616) is widely regarded as the greatest playwright and poet in the English language, often referred to as the "Bard of Avon." His works, including plays, sonnets, and narrative poems, have had a profound impact on literature, theater, and culture worldwide.

His contributions to the English language are immense, with numerous phrases and words still in common use today attributed to his writings [Shakespeare's Influence on Language](https://www.bl.uk/shakespeare/articles/shakespeares-language). This article provides a comprehensive overview of Shakespeare’s life, works, historical context, and enduring legacy.

## Historical Background

### Early Life
William Shakespeare was born in Stratford-upon-Avon, a market town in Warwickshire, England. While his exact birth date is unknown, records indicate he was baptized on April 26, 1564, and it is traditionally assumed he was born on or around April 23. He was the third of eight children born to John Shakespeare, a glove-maker and local official, and Mary Arden, who came from a landowning family. Little is known about his early education, though it is likely he attended the local grammar school, where he would have studied Latin, Greek, and classical literature [Shakespeare's Early Life](https://www.folger.edu/shakespeares-life).

At the age of 18, Shakespeare married Anne Hathaway, with whom he had three children: Susanna (1583) and twins Hamnet and Judith (1585). Tragically, Hamnet died at the age of 11, an event some scholars believe influenced the emotional depth of Shakespeare’s later works [Anne Hathaway and Family](https://www.shakespeare.org.uk/explore-shakespeare/shakespedia/shakespeares-family/).

### Career in London
By the late 1580s, Shakespeare had moved to London, where he began his career as an actor and playwright. His early works include historical plays such as *Henry VI* and comedies like *The Taming of the Shrew*. By 1594, he was a leading member of the Lord Chamberlain’s Men, a prominent acting troupe later known as the King’s Men under the patronage of King James I. This company performed at the Globe Theatre, which Shakespeare co-owned [Globe Theatre History](https://www.shakespearesglobe.com/discover/about-us/history/).

Shakespeare’s career spanned approximately 25 years, during which he wrote tragedies such as *Hamlet*, *Macbeth*, and *King Lear*, comedies like *A Midsummer Night’s Dream*, and romances such as *The Tempest*. His works were popular during his lifetime, though he did not achieve the near-mythical status he holds today until centuries later [Shakespeare's Career](https://www.bl.uk/shakespeare/articles/shakespeare-in-his-own-age).

### Later Life and Death
Shakespeare retired to Stratford-upon-Avon around 1613, after a prolific career. He died on April 23, 1616, at the age of 52, and was buried in the chancel of Holy Trinity Church in Stratford. The cause of his death remains unknown, though theories include illness or natural causes. His epitaph, inscribed on his gravestone, famously warns against disturbing his remains [Shakespeare's Death](https://www.shakespeare.org.uk/explore-shakespeare/shakespedia/shakespeares-death/).
