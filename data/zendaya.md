# Zendaya

Zendaya Maree Stoermer Coleman (born September 1, 1996), known mononymously as Zendaya, is an American actress and singer who rose to prominence through roles in Disney Channel productions before achieving critical success in mature dramatic parts.  
She began her entertainment career as a child model and backup dancer, securing her breakout role as Rocky Blue in the Disney series *Shake It Up* (2010–2013), followed by starring as K.C. Cooper in *K.C. Undercover* (2015–2018).  
Transitioning to film and prestige television, Zendaya portrayed Michelle "MJ" Jones in the Marvel Cinematic Universe's *Spider-Man* trilogy (2016–2021) and Anne Wheeler in *The Greatest Showman* (2017), while her performance as the troubled teenager Rue Bennett in HBO's *Euphoria* (2019–present) garnered two Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series, establishing her as the youngest winner in that category at age 24.

Throughout her career, Zendaya has maintained a relatively low-profile public persona, avoiding major scandals while addressing instances of perceived racial bias in media commentary, such as criticism of her hairstyle at the 2015 Academy Awards.

## Early life

### Family background and upbringing

Zendaya Maree Stoermer Coleman was born on September 1, 1996, in Oakland, California, to Claire Stoermer and Kazembe Ajamu Coleman. Her mother is of German and Scottish ancestry, while her father is African American, with roots tracing to Nigerian heritage and Arkansas sharecroppers. As a biracial person, Zendaya has publicly identified with her Black heritage, stating pride in being African American and describing herself as Hollywood's "acceptable version of a Black girl" in discussions of colorism.

Her parents, both former teachers, met through connections in the Bay Area arts scene, with Stoermer working at the California Shakespeare Theater in Orinda near Oakland, where she managed operations and used earnings to support family outings. Coleman held various roles, including teaching and security, before later becoming Zendaya's manager. The couple divorced when Zendaya was young, yet they maintained cooperative co-parenting, with both remaining actively involved in her life amid a blended family structure. Zendaya is the only biological child of Stoermer and Coleman together, but she grew up with five older half-siblings from her father's prior relationships: sisters Katianna, Annabella, and Kaylee, and brothers Austin and Julien.

Raised in a modest, working-class household in urban Oakland's diverse environment, Zendaya experienced a formative home life shaped by her parents' dedication to education and self-reliance, including Stoermer's teaching in underfunded inner-city schools. This setting fostered resilience and a strong work ethic, as the family navigated economic challenges without emphasis on external systemic support, emphasizing personal effort and family unity.

### Education and early training

Zendaya attended **Fruitvale Elementary School** in Oakland, California, during her early years. She subsequently enrolled at the **Oakland School for the Arts**, a public charter institution serving grades 6 through 12 with a focus on performing arts disciplines, where she engaged in theater activities while still a student.

To accommodate her initial acting auditions and commitments, Zendaya shifted to part-time homeschooling during her later schooling, forgoing traditional high school attendance in favor of flexible education that supported her professional pursuits. She completed her high school requirements and graduated in 2015.

Her early performing arts development occurred through local community programs, including enrollment at age eight in the **Future Shock Oakland** dance group, where she trained in hip-hop and hula styles for three years. Additional instruction encompassed ballet fundamentals and theater workshops at the **California Shakespeare Theater** conservatory in Orinda, involving stage performances that honed her skills independently of major institutional pipelines. Initial non-professional exposures included child modeling for retailers such as Macy's and Old Navy starting in her pre-teen years, alongside backup dancing in a Sears commercial with Selena Gomez around 2008.

## Acting career

### Early roles and Disney breakthrough (2009–2018)

Zendaya began her acting career with background work as a child model and backup dancer for brands including Macy's, Mervyns, and Old Navy, prior to securing on-screen roles. Her television debut came in the Disney Channel series *Shake It Up* (2010–2013), where she portrayed Rocky Blue, a street-smart dancer navigating high school and aspirations for a professional dance career alongside co-star Bella Thorne as CeCe Jones. The series premiered on November 7, 2010, attracting 6.2 million viewers for its debut episode, which highlighted its appeal to young audiences through dance-focused episodes and comedic storylines.

In 2011, Zendaya reprised her *Shake It Up* character in a crossover guest appearance on *Good Luck Charlie* in the episode "Charlie Shakes It Up," aired June 5, which integrated her established role into the family sitcom format. Following the conclusion of *Shake It Up*, she starred as K.C. Cooper, a high school student and undercover spy, in the Disney Channel series *K.C. Undercover* (2015–2018), marking her first lead role with co-producing credits at age 19. The show emphasized action-comedy elements, requiring Zendaya to perform stunts and demonstrate physical agility within Disney's youth-targeted constraints, spanning three seasons.

Zendaya's transition to feature films during this period included her role as Michelle "MJ" Jones in *Spider-Man: Homecoming* (2017), a supporting character providing sarcastic commentary in the Marvel Cinematic Universe reboot starring Tom Holland. The film grossed $880 million worldwide, driven by strong ensemble performances and franchise momentum rather than individual breakout appeal. She also provided the voice of Meechee, a curious yeti, in the animated film *Smallfoot* (2018), contributing to its musical and thematic exploration of myth versus reality. These roles underscored her shift from formulaic television dance and spy genres to broader cinematic demands, evidenced by audience draw and production scale.

### Transition to adult roles and acclaim (2019–present)

Zendaya marked her shift from youth-oriented projects to mature roles with the lead in HBO's *Euphoria*, premiering June 16, 2019, where she plays Rue Bennett, a teenager contending with opioid addiction and its cascading effects on family and identity. The series depicts Rue's cycles of relapse and withdrawal with graphic intensity, drawing from real patterns of substance dependency observed in clinical contexts, though some critiques note occasional dramatization for narrative effect. *Euphoria* holds an IMDb user rating of 8.2/10 based on over 281,000 votes, underscoring viewer engagement with its portrayal of unvarnished adolescent turmoil.

In film, Zendaya reprised MJ in *Spider-Man: No Way Home* (December 17, 2021), aiding its $1.92 billion worldwide gross amid post-pandemic recovery, evidencing her role in franchise profitability. As Chani in *Dune* (October 22, 2021), she embodied a resilient Fremen fighter in the adaptation of Frank Herbert's novel, with the film achieving $410 million globally on a $165 million budget despite hybrid theatrical-streaming release. The sequel, *Dune: Part Two* (March 1, 2024), deepened Chani's perspective on rebellion and loyalty, grossing $714 million worldwide on a $190 million budget, reflecting strong audience turnout for her expanded presence.

Zendaya starred as Tashi Duncan in *Challengers* (April 26, 2024), a drama intertwining professional tennis rivalries with personal betrayals, which earned $94 million worldwide against a $55 million budget, performing solidly in adult-skewing markets. These roles demonstrate her pivot to narratives demanding emotional depth and physical demands, validated by box office returns exceeding production costs and sustained viewer metrics, rather than reliance on ancillary factors. Her 2026 lineup includes *Dune: Part Three*, *Spider-Man: Brand New Day*, *The Drama*, and Christopher Nolan's *The Odyssey*, alongside *Euphoria* season 3, signaling ongoing industry investment in her versatility.

## Music career

### Debut singles and album

Zendaya's debut single, "Swag It Out" featuring Bobby Brackins, was released on May 30, 2011, as a promotional track tied to the Disney Channel series *Shake It Up*. The song, which emphasized youthful energy and dance themes, did not achieve notable chart positions on Billboard rankings but garnered attention through its music video, uploaded on December 15, 2011, which accumulated over 10 million views.

Her second single, "Replay", issued in July 2013, marked her first entry on the Billboard Hot 100, where it peaked at number 40. The track received a platinum certification from the RIAA in 2023, reflecting over one million units sold or streamed in the United States.

The self-titled album *Zendaya*, released on September 17, 2013, by Hollywood Records, featured "Replay" as its lead single alongside tracks produced by contributors including Timbaland. It debuted at number 51 on the Billboard 200, with first-week sales of 7,000 copies in the United States. The album's commercial performance was modest, as it failed to sustain chart presence or generate additional hit singles, contributing to Zendaya's pivot toward acting priorities.

In 2016, Zendaya released "Something New" featuring Chris Brown on February 3, intended as the lead single for a planned sophomore album that was not completed. The collaboration achieved limited chart success compared to "Replay" and underscored the challenges in expanding her music catalog beyond the Disney-associated releases.

### Performances and collaborations

Zendaya embarked on her debut concert tour, the Swag It Out Tour, which began on August 5, 2012, and concluded on November 1, 2014, primarily consisting of performances at state fairs and music festivals across North America. The tour supported her early Disney Channel music releases, including singles like "Swag It Out" and "Watch Me," a collaboration with Bella Thorne from the *Shake It Up* soundtrack, and drew crowds through free admission tied to fair entry, appealing to a niche audience of preteens and teens familiar with her television work. Specific attendance figures for individual dates, such as her June 13, 2014, show at Music Mill Amphitheatre in Arlington, Texas, or August 23, 2014, at Benton County Fairgrounds in Kennewick, Washington, were not publicly reported in detail, reflecting the tour's promotional rather than large-scale commercial scale.

In addition to the tour, Zendaya delivered live performances tied to promotional events for *Shake It Up*, such as her rendition of "Something to Dance For" at the White House Easter Egg Roll on April 9, 2012, which integrated dance elements from the series. She also performed at Radio Disney events, including a dance-off with the *Shake It Up* cast to a remix of Selena Gomez's "Shake It Up" at the D23 Expo on August 23, 2011. Her most notable standalone music performance came at the 2014 Radio Disney Music Awards on April 26, where she sang "Replay," garnering positive reception among Disney's target demographic, though the event's viewership metrics emphasized its broadcast reach over ticketed attendance.

Post-2013, Zendaya's live music efforts diminished, with no subsequent tours announced and activity limited to guest appearances in music videos rather than collaborative live features. She made a cameo in Taylor Swift's "Bad Blood (Remix)" video released on May 17, 2015, which amassed over 1 billion YouTube views, highlighting her visibility in pop culture crossovers but not involving musical performance. Similarly, her appearance in Bruno Mars's "Versace on the Floor" video in 2017 focused on visual narrative without vocal contribution. These efforts underscored a pivot away from sustained music performance, aligning with her growing emphasis on acting, and lacked the empirical metrics of broad audience draw seen in major artists' tours.

## Fashion and business ventures

### Style influences and red carpet presence

Zendaya's red carpet aesthetic evolved from youthful, casual ensembles during her Disney tenure to sophisticated high-fashion statements, largely shaped by her long-term collaboration with stylist Law Roach beginning in 2011. Roach, dubbed her "image architect," emphasizes archival and vintage selections, often drawing from designers' historical collections to create narrative-driven looks that blend femininity with structured silhouettes. This partnership marked a departure from trend-following toward curated ensembles prioritizing silhouette and historical reference over ephemeral hype.

A pivotal early moment occurred at the 87th Academy Awards on February 22, 2015, where Zendaya wore a cream silk Vivienne Westwood gown from the 2015 collection paired with dreadlocks, sparking public debate after E! host Giuliana Rancic commented on-air that the hairstyle might "smell like patchouli oil or weed." Zendaya responded via Instagram, critiquing racial biases in perceptions of Black hair textures and professionalism, which ignited broader discussions on cultural appropriation and hair politics in fashion. Roach later credited the appearance with fostering a "global conversation" that influenced legislation like The CROWN Act, aimed at prohibiting hair discrimination, while underscoring Zendaya's commitment to authentic representation over conventional glamour.

Her influences favor vintage revivals and menswear elements, evident in standout appearances like the 2021 Met Gala in a custom Valentino gown echoing 1990s silhouettes or tailored suits at film premieres that borrow from menswear tailoring for elongated, practical proportions suitable for movement. This approach earned her the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) Fashion Icon Award in November 2021, making her the youngest recipient at age 25, with citations highlighting her role in elevating archival fashion through red carpet visibility. Empirical metrics, such as Instagram analyses showing her styled images generating 109% more engagement than average fashion posts, reflect the practical appeal and media resonance of these choices, which prioritize wearability and historical depth over ostentatious displays.

### Endorsements and brand ambassadorships

Zendaya began securing brand endorsements during her Disney era, starting with the Material Girl clothing line, co-created by Madonna and Lourdes Leon, for which she was named the face in June 2014. This partnership involved multiple campaigns, including spring 2015 ads emphasizing youthful, confident styling, though specific contract values or direct sales lifts attributable to her involvement remain undisclosed.

In 2016, she signed with CoverGirl cosmetics, appearing in campaigns that leveraged her rising teen audience, followed by Dolce \u0026 Gabbana's spring/summer 2017 ads. By 2018, Zendaya became an ambassador for Tommy Hilfiger, co-designing collections that contributed to the brand's youth-targeted revenue streams, though quantifiable impacts were not publicly detailed. Her 2019 appointment as Lancôme's global beauty ambassador marked entry into luxury skincare, with campaigns promoting products like mascara and serums; while Lancôme highlighted her appeal to diverse demographics, no verified data links her role to measurable sales increases beyond general brand growth.

Subsequent deals included Bulgari jewelry ambassadorships, Glaceau Smartwater in June 2022, and Louis Vuitton in 2023, each aligning with her fashion-forward image to drive visibility.  In endorsements, Zendaya has demonstrated negotiation leverage, reportedly securing multimillion-dollar agreements that reflect her market value, estimated to contribute significantly to her overall earnings without relying on symbolic narratives.

A notable recent partnership is with On Running, announced in June 2024 as a multiyear brand ambassadorship involving co-creation; this includes the 2025 "Be Every You" campaign launching August 7 with the Cloudzone Moon sneaker and apparel, plus the April "Zone Dreamers" initiative.  Early ads generated $1.7 million in media impact value within two days in October 2024, indicating short-term publicity gains, though long-term sales sustainability depends on sustained consumer conversion amid On's double-digit growth trajectory. These deals underscore mutual commercial incentives, with brands accessing her endorsement power for revenue potential while she expands into product influence, as seen in her first co-designed On silhouette.

## Philanthropy and public advocacy

### Charitable initiatives

Zendaya has participated in targeted charitable efforts focused on child welfare and arts accessibility, often leveraging her platform for direct aid.

In December 2011, at age 15, she collaborated with actress Madison Pettis to promote the Toys for Tots campaign, which delivers holiday gifts to millions of disadvantaged children annually through the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve.

For her 18th birthday on September 1, 2014, Zendaya organized a fundraiser via Save the Children that supplied meals to more than 100 malnourished children in Haiti, Tanzania, and Malawi. In 2016, marking her 20th birthday, she contributed to UNICEF, funding food for 500 children facing famine in South Sudan.

In February 2024, Zendaya provided a $100,000 grant to the California Shakespeare Theater's North Star Fund via the Women Donors Network, bolstering programs at the Oakland venue where her mother was employed as a house manager and where Zendaya performed in youth productions starting at age 11.

In late 2023, Zendaya shared links on her Instagram Stories to the Palestinian Children's Relief Fund (PCRF) for humanitarian aid to children in Gaza.

### Political positions and associated debates

Zendaya has publicly supported the Black Lives Matter movement, including an Instagram post on July 4, 2020, declaring "#BlackLivesMatter forever". In an August 2020 interview with InStyle, she conversed with BLM co-founder Patrisse Cullors about activism and expressed personal fears for her 65-year-old Black father's safety amid police shootings, attributing these to broader systemic issues.  Following her Emmy win in September 2020, she highlighted barriers faced by young Black individuals in a system "not built for" them. Associated debates include critiques that celebrity endorsements of BLM, often amplified by mainstream media outlets with documented left-leaning biases, can prioritize symbolic gestures over empirical scrutiny of the movement's policy impacts, such as correlations between "defund the police" initiatives and rising urban crime rates in cities like Minneapolis and Portland post-2020, though Zendaya has not commented on these data points.

In voter mobilization efforts, Zendaya joined Michelle Obama for an Instagram Live on September 22, 2020, for National Voter Registration Day, encouraging Gen Z participation and warning against procrastination in voting plans.  She urged followers to "Vote this mf out" on November 2, 2020, widely interpreted as opposition to incumbent President Donald Trump. These activities aligned with narratives of voter suppression prevalent in 2020 Democratic mobilization, yet U.S. Census Bureau data recorded a 66.8% turnout among the voting-eligible population—the highest since 1900—undermining claims of widespread barriers, with registered voter numbers and mail-in options expanding access rather than restricting it. Debates around such celebrity-driven drives question their efficacy versus potential for reinforcing unverified suppression tropes, especially given Zendaya's emphasis on personal merit in her career trajectory, which contrasts with collective grievance framing in these causes.

On gun control, Zendaya tweeted in April 2017, "School is supposed to be a safe place for children....we need gun control, NOW," reacting to a school-related incident. In March 2018, she praised student-led walkouts against gun violence and supported the CNN town hall featuring Parkland survivors advocating stricter laws.  This stance aligns with progressive pushes for restrictions, though critics, emphasizing Second Amendment individual rights, argue such positions overlook data on defensive gun uses (estimated at 500,000 to 3 million annually by sources like the CDC) and the inefficacy of prior laws like the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban in reducing crime rates. Some online discourse has labeled celebrity advocacy, including hers, as performative, particularly as Zendaya has distanced herself from the "activist" label, stating in 2020 it demands a sustained lifestyle she does not pursue, amid sparse but pointed criticisms questioning the depth of Hollywood commitments to these issues.
## Personal life

### Family relationships

Zendaya maintains amicable relationships with both parents despite their divorce finalized in 2016 after an eight-year marriage. Her mother, Claire Stoermer, a former elementary school teacher with interests in the arts, has continued to shape Zendaya's creative inclinations through shared exposure to theater and performance, even post-separation. Her father, Kazembe Ajamu Coleman, has provided ongoing support by acting as her manager early in her career and later assuming security duties at events, emphasizing a protective family dynamic amid her rising fame.

As the only biological child of Stoermer and Coleman, Zendaya shares her household with five older half-siblings from her father's prior relationships: sisters Katianna, Annabella, and Kaylee Stoermer Coleman, and brothers Austin and Julien Coleman. She has described these siblings as integral to her sense of normalcy, with particular closeness to Julien's daughter Ezenia, whom she treats as a niece and often references in interviews as a source of familial joy. Family members have appeared alongside her at select public events, reinforcing their role as a stabilizing influence.

However, in March 2025, paternal half-sister Latonja Coleman, aged 51, publicly claimed a rift, stating she had seen Zendaya only twice in the prior seven years and expressing desire for reconnection independent of financial motives. Zendaya has not responded directly to these allegations, and no similar estrangements with other relatives have been reported, aligning with her broader narrative of family as an anchor against celebrity pressures.

### Romantic partnerships and privacy challenges

Zendaya was linked romantically to actor Jacob Elordi, her co-star on the HBO series *Euphoria*, from 2019 to 2020. The relationship gained attention after paparazzi photographed them vacationing in Greece in August 2019, though Zendaya never confirmed it publicly. 

She began dating British actor Tom Holland, her co-star in the Marvel Cinematic Universe's *Spider-Man* films, around 2020, with the relationship becoming public in July 2021 when Holland shared an Instagram photo of them kissing.  The couple announced their engagement in December 2024, following a proposal during the holiday season, confirmed by family sources and media reports including a debut of her ring at the 2025 Golden Globes.  Plans for their wedding have been deferred to 2026 amid professional schedules, with Zendaya stating she is "resting up" for it. Public commentary on their partnership has occasionally highlighted their height disparity—Holland at 5 feet 8 inches and Zendaya at 5 feet 10 inches—but such jests constitute limited scrutiny relative to intensified media exposure.

Fame has imposed tangible constraints on their privacy, as Zendaya noted in 2024 that intimate moments "between two people" often escape personal control due to public dissemination. She has actively evaded paparazzi through infrequent joint appearances, such as a rare July 2025 outing, while admitting the "negative side" of stardom erodes autonomy.  In a September 2024 *Dune: Part Two* screening discussion, Zendaya voiced uncertainty about enduring fame's pressures, preferring to "be a person" unbound by constant observation. Instances like supportive gestures at 2025 galas, including comments from co-star Storm Reid on their impending wedding, illustrate persistent intrusion without alleviating the structural boundary losses tied to celebrity status.

## Public perception and controversies

### Media image and cultural impact

Zendaya's media image is frequently characterized as that of an "unproblematic" celebrity, stemming from her relatively scandal-free public profile amid peers in Hollywood who often face tabloid scrutiny for personal missteps or controversies. This perception arises from her deliberate avoidance of high-profile feuds or legal issues, allowing focus on professional achievements rather than personal drama, as evidenced by limited negative coverage in entertainment outlets compared to contemporaries. In 2022, Time magazine included her in its list of the 100 Most Influential People, highlighting her role in elevating discussions on representation through performance rather than mere tokenism. Her ascent, beginning with Disney Channel roles and extending to critically received parts in films like *Spider-Man: Homecoming*, underscores a trajectory driven by versatile acting skills over engineered diversity quotas, though mainstream narratives sometimes overemphasize the latter at the expense of empirical talent metrics such as box office returns and viewership data.

With approximately 177 million Instagram followers as of October 2025, Zendaya commands a vast digital audience, amplifying her influence on trends in fashion and lifestyle among younger demographics. However, the sustainability of such celebrity—tied heavily to algorithmic visibility and project releases—invites skepticism, as historical patterns show many high-follower stars experience rapid declines without consistent substantive output. Her portrayal as a fashion icon, reinforced by accolades like the 2021 CFDA Fashion Icon Award as the youngest recipient, contributes to this image, yet critics question whether the hype reflects genuine cultural depth or amplified media echo chambers favoring select figures.

Zendaya's cultural impact manifests particularly through roles depicting adolescent realities, such as Rue Bennett in *Euphoria*, which has shaped Gen Z aesthetics in makeup, clothing, and attitudes toward mental health and addiction without sanitization typical of youth-oriented media. This realism contrasts with prior sanitized teen portrayals, fostering discussions on substance use and identity pressures grounded in observable societal data rather than idealized fiction. Nonetheless, while praised for authenticity, the series' influence risks overhyping transient trends over enduring societal shifts, as viewer engagement metrics, though high, do not conclusively demonstrate long-term behavioral causation amid broader cultural noise.

### Criticisms, casting debates, and responses

In 2014, Zendaya faced backlash after being cast to portray Aaliyah in a planned Lifetime biopic, with critics arguing her lighter skin tone did not match the singer's darker complexion, raising concerns about colorism and authenticity in casting Black roles. The project ultimately collapsed due to production disputes over rights with Aaliyah's estate, but the debate highlighted tensions over phenotypic representation in biopics.

Zendaya's role as "MJ" (later clarified as Michelle Jones, a reimagined character inspired by Mary Jane Watson) in the 2017 film *Spider-Man: Homecoming* drew complaints from some comic book fans, who objected to race-bending a traditionally white, redheaded character for diversity purposes, viewing it as prioritizing representation over fidelity to source material. While some backlash included overtly racist attacks, others focused on narrative consistency in adaptations, with director Jon Watts defending the choice as creative liberty rather than quota-driven.

During the 2015 Academy Awards, E! host Giuliana Rancic commented on-air that Zendaya's faux dreadlocks would make her look as if she "smells like patchouli oil or weed," prompting accusations of racial insensitivity and cultural ignorance. Rancic issued an on-air apology the next day, admitting the joke was misguided, which Zendaya accepted while using the incident to educate on the ancient origins of locs across cultures, including Viking and Celtic history, to counter stereotypes.

Zendaya has critiqued her early Disney Channel experiences for limiting her to stereotypical roles that reinforced typecasting for young Black actresses, contributing to her decision to leave after *K.C. Undercover* in 2015 despite negotiating for more substantive content.

In January 2022, the anti-drug organization D.A.R.E. condemned HBO's *Euphoria*, in which Zendaya stars, for glamorizing high school drug use, addiction, and destructive behaviors through its stylized depictions, arguing it misled viewers on consequences.

Zendaya has responded to such casting disputes by emphasizing merit and performance over identity politics, stating in 2016 that fan reactions to her *Spider-Man* role were exaggerated and that talent drives success, not preconceived notions of representation. Her films provide empirical rebuttal to quota critiques, with *Spider-Man: Homecoming* grossing $880 million worldwide and the *Dune* series exceeding $1.1 billion each, indicating audience validation of her casting independent of diversity mandates. For *Euphoria* criticisms, she clarified in February 2022 that the series humanizes addiction's realities rather than endorsing it, rejecting moralistic framing in favor of nuanced portrayal. These defenses underscore a broader debate where empirical outcomes like box office performance challenge claims of unearned representation, though source material purists maintain adaptations should preserve original demographics absent compelling artistic justification.

## Awards and recognition

### Emmy and Golden Globe wins

Zendaya won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series for her portrayal of Rue Bennett in HBO's *Euphoria* at the 72nd ceremony on September 20, 2020, becoming the youngest recipient of the award at 24 years and 19 days old, surpassing previous record-holder Imelda Staunton. The category featured six nominees, including established performers like Olivia Colman and Jodie Comer, selected from over 100 eligible submissions by the academy's performers peer group of approximately 6,000 voters, highlighting the competitive nature of the field based on peer recognition of dramatic range and character depth. In her acceptance speech, delivered remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Zendaya emphasized the collaborative effort behind the performance and dedicated the win to individuals struggling with addiction, underscoring themes of perseverance and realism in depicting complex personal struggles.

She secured a second Emmy in the same category at the 74th Primetime Emmy Awards on September 12, 2022, for *Euphoria*'s second season, making her the youngest two-time winner in the category's history amid another field of six nominees such as Laura Linney and Reese Witherspoon. This repeat victory, voted on by the Television Academy's expanded electorate of over 10,000 members across disciplines, reflected sustained critical acclaim for her nuanced portrayal of addiction and trauma, with Zendaya noting in her speech the "hard work" and emotional toll of embodying Rue's challenges. The awards' structure, emphasizing peer-voted excellence in scripted drama, positions these wins as empirical markers of industry validation in a category where repeat successes are rare, occurring in fewer than 10% of cases historically.

For the Golden Globes, Zendaya received her first win in the Best Actress in a Television Series – Drama category at the 80th ceremony on January 10, 2023, again for *Euphoria*, outpacing nominees like Sydney Sweeney and Bella Ramsey in a field determined by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association's roughly 80 members post-reform. Absent from the event, she later expressed gratitude via social media, framing Rue's character as a "gift" that allowed exploration of profound human experiences, aligning with voter preferences for authentic, high-stakes performances in limited-submission categories. She was nominated for Best Performance by a Female Actor in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy for her role in *Challengers* (2024) at the 82nd Golden Globes on January 5, 2025, but did not win, competing against five others in a category voted similarly by the HFPA for films blending commercial appeal with artistic merit. These honors, drawn from distinct voter pools—the Emmys' broad TV professionals versus the Globes' international journalists—provide cross-verified evidence of her standing in prestige television acting, where empirical success correlates with rigorous preparation and role immersion over broader popularity metrics.

### Other accolades and nominations

Zendaya won the Best Actress award at the 2022 BET Awards for her role as Rue Bennett in *Euphoria*.

In the fashion industry, she received the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) Fashion Icon Award in 2021, marking her as the youngest recipient of the honor at age 25.

At the Critics' Choice Awards, Zendaya secured the Best Actress in a Drama Series win in 2023 for *Euphoria*, following a 2021 nomination for Best Actress for *Malcolm \u0026 Marie* and receipt of the SeeHer Award that same year, recognizing authentic portrayals of women across media.

Beyond these, she earned a nomination for Best Performance by a Female Actor in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy at the 2025 Golden Globe Awards for her lead role in *Challengers*, but did not win the category.

Zendaya's broader recognition includes over 70 nominations across television, film, and ancillary categories, reflecting consistent critical attention despite selective victories outside her Emmy and primary Golden Globe successes.

### Television roles

Zendaya began her television career with a co-starring role as Rocky Blue, an intelligent and disciplined aspiring dancer, in the Disney Channel sitcom *Shake It Up*, which aired from November 7, 2010, to November 10, 2013, spanning three seasons and 75 episodes. The series centered on Rocky and her best friend CeCe navigating auditions, rehearsals, and personal challenges to perform as background dancers on a local Chicago teen dance show. Its premiere episode, "Start It Up," attracted 6.2 million viewers, marking a strong debut for the network, though later episodes saw declining ratings, with some dipping to 2.5 million.

In 2015, Zendaya returned to Disney Channel as both star and executive producer in *K.C. Undercover*, portraying K.C. Cooper, a high school student and math prodigy recruited into her parents' covert spy operations, across three seasons and 75 episodes from January 18, 2015, to February 2, 2018. The show's pilot episode drew 3.5 million total viewers, benefiting from Zendaya's established fanbase, though subsequent episodes experienced softer numbers, such as 1.12 million for a 2016 outing amid competition from major events.

Zendaya's most critically acclaimed television work came in the HBO drama series *Euphoria*, where she stars as Rue Bennett, a teenage drug addict grappling with relapse, mental health issues, and relationships, from June 16, 2019, to present. As of October 2025, the series has aired 16 episodes across two seasons, with an eight-episode third season in production since January 2025 and slated for 2026 release. Season 2 averaged 16.3 million viewers per episode across platforms, including a series-high 6.6 million for the finale, establishing it as HBO's second-most-watched series behind *Game of Thrones*.

Zendaya has made select guest appearances, including as Resheida, a friend of the Johnson family's daughter Zoey, in the October 14, 2015, episode "Daddy's Day" of ABC's *black-ish*. She also reprised Rocky Blue in the *Good Luck Charlie* crossover episode "Charlie Shakes It Up" (April 5, 2012) and guest-starred as Sequoia Jones in *A.N.T. Farm*'s "Creative Chaos" (June 17, 2011). These roles, often tied to her Disney affiliations, contributed to her early visibility but were limited compared to her lead series commitments.

### Discography

Zendaya released her debut studio album, *Zendaya*, on September 17, 2013, through Hollywood Records. The album debuted and peaked at number 51 on the Billboard 200, selling 7,000 copies in its first week.

The project yielded the lead single "Replay," issued on July 16, 2013. "Replay" reached number 40 on the Billboard Hot 100 and spent 12 weeks on the chart. It has sold over 1.2 million copies in the United States and received triple platinum certification from the RIAA in 2023, denoting 3 million units in sales and streaming equivalents.

In 2016, Zendaya issued the single "Something New" featuring Chris Brown on February 3. The track peaked at number 10 on the Billboard Rhythmic Airplay chart and number 28 on Pop Airplay. It sold approximately 11,900 digital copies in its strongest U.S. sales week.

Zendaya has also contributed vocals to soundtrack recordings, including "Rewrite the Stars" from *The Greatest Showman* (2017), which peaked at number 70 on the Hot 100, though these fall outside her primary solo releases. No further studio albums have been released as of 2025.

### Concert tours

Zendaya's debut concert tour, the Swag It Out Tour (later rebranded as Zendaya: Live in Concert), commenced on August 5, 2012, and extended through November 1, 2014, encompassing performances across North America at state fairs, music festivals, and themed parks. The tour supported her early music releases, including singles like "Swag It Out" from her Disney Channel tenure on *Shake It Up*, and featured setlists with tracks such as "Replay," "Remember Me," and covers of contemporary pop songs. Notable dates included a December 3, 2013, appearance at the SAP Center in San Jose, California, as part of the Triple Ho Show, and a May 31, 2014, headline slot at Magic Springs Theme and Water Park in Hot Springs, Arkansas, opening the venue's summer concert series. 

The tour's scope remained limited, with documented performances numbering in the low dozens based on available setlist and archival records, rather than large-scale arena engagements, aligning with Zendaya's emerging status as a teen artist under Disney promotion. No comprehensive gross revenues or attendance estimates have been publicly reported by industry trackers like Billboard, indicative of its regional, event-based format rather than a major commercial outing.

Post-2014, Zendaya has not conducted further headlining concert tours, pivoting primarily to acting pursuits, though she has made sporadic live appearances, such as guest spots at festivals (e.g., Coachella in April 2023) and award ceremonies, without resuming structured touring. This shift reflects her career trajectory away from music performance toward film and television, with music efforts confined to studio recordings and collaborations.
