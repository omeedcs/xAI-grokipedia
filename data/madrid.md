## Historical Background

Madrid's history dates back to the 9th century when it was established as a small Moorish fortress called "Magerit" during the Islamic rule of the Iberian Peninsula. The name is believed to derive from the Arabic term for "place of many streams," reflecting the area's abundant water sources. After the Christian Reconquista in the 11th century, Madrid became a minor town under Castilian control. Its fortunes changed dramatically in 1561 when King Philip II moved the royal court from Toledo to Madrid, transforming it into the political center of the Spanish Empire [History of Madrid](https://www.britannica.com/place/Madrid).

During the 17th and 18th centuries, Madrid flourished as the capital of a vast empire, with the construction of iconic landmarks such as the Royal Palace (Palacio Real) and the Plaza Mayor. The city played a central role during the Spanish War of Independence (1808–1814) against Napoleonic forces, an event immortalized in Francisco Goya's paintings. In the 20th century, Madrid endured significant turmoil during the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939), serving as a Republican stronghold before falling to Franco’s Nationalist forces. Post-war reconstruction and rapid urbanization in the latter half of the century shaped Madrid into a modern metropolis [Spanish Civil War](https://www.history.com/topics/european-history/spanish-civil-war).
