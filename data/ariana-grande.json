  "content": "# Ariana Grande\n\nAriana Grande-Butera (born June 26, 1993) is an American singer, songwriter, and actress distinguished by her four-octave vocal range that incorporates whistle register capabilities. She initially gained recognition through roles in Nickelodeon television series, including Cat Valentine in *Victorious* (2010–2013) and the spin-off *Sam \\u0026 Cat* (2013–2014), before pivoting to music with her debut album *Yours Truly* (2013), which reached number one on the Billboard 200 chart. Grande has since issued seven studio albums, accumulating over 7.6 million in equivalent album units sold globally, alongside nine Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles, establishing her as one of the top-selling female artists of the 2010s and 2020s. Her accolades include two Grammy Awards from 18 nominations, reflecting sustained critical and commercial impact in pop music. Notable events in her career encompass the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing at her concert, prompting her organization of the benefit *One Love Manchester* event, as well as a transition into film with a lead role as Glinda in the 2024 *Wicked* adaptation, for which she received a Golden Globe nomination. Grande's public profile has also involved controversies such as a 2015 donut shop incident where she was recorded licking merchandise without purchase and making disparaging remarks, alongside periodic scrutiny over personal relationships and stylistic choices perceived as cultural appropriation, though these have not significantly impeded her professional trajectory.\n\n## Early life\n\n### Family and upbringing\n\nAriana Grande was born Ariana Grande-Butera on June 26, 1993, in Boca Raton, Florida. She is the daughter of Joan Grande, chief executive officer of Hose-McCann Communications—a manufacturer of communications and safety equipment primarily serving the U.S. Marines and Navy—and Edward Butera, a graphic designer, photographer, and artist who owned a design firm in Boca Raton. Both parents are of Italian ancestry, with Butera tracing roots to Sicily and Joan Grande to Abruzzo.\n\nGrande has one older half-sibling, brother Frankie Grande (born Frank James Michael Grande Marchione on January 24, 1983), an entertainer, producer, and Broadway performer, whom she shares with her mother from Joan's prior marriage to Victor Marchione; the siblings maintain a close relationship. Her parents divorced during her childhood, after which Joan raised Ariana primarily in Boca Raton, where the family's professional operations were based.\n\nGrande was raised in an upper-middle-class household in Boca Raton, a suburb known for its affluent communities, and showed early interest in performance arts facilitated by her mother's involvement in local theater; Joan formed a children's troupe called Kids Who Care following the closure of the Little Palm Theatre, in which Ariana participated. The family had relocated from New York to Florida prior to her birth, establishing roots in the region's business and cultural scene. She was initially raised Roman Catholic, consistent with her Italian-American heritage, though she later rejected organized Catholicism in her adolescence, citing the church's positions on homosexuality in light of her brother's sexual orientation, and explored Kabbalah as an alternative spiritual framework.\n\n### Education and initial performances\n\nAriana Grande attended **Pine Crest School** in Boca Raton, Florida, during her early childhood and later transferred to **North Broward Preparatory School** in Coconut Creek, where she pursued a rigorous academic curriculum alongside her burgeoning interest in performing arts. \n\nAs her theater commitments intensified, Grande shifted to homeschooling in her later high school years, receiving coursework materials from North Broward Preparatory School and completing studies under private tutors to accommodate travel and rehearsals.  She graduated from high school in 2012.\n\nGrande's initial performances began in local South Florida theater scenes, where she appeared in youth productions, including a role in the musical *Annie* at the **Fort Lauderdale Children's Theatre**. She also participated in **Kids Who Care**, a children's performance group formed by her mother, Joan Grande, which provided early opportunities for singing and acting in community events.\n\nHer breakthrough came at age 15 with a professional stage role as Charlotte in the Broadway musical *13*, which opened on **October 5, 2008**, at the Bernard B. Jacobs Theatre and closed on **January 4, 2009**, after 105 performances.   This debut, under the direction of Jason Robert Brown, showcased her vocal abilities in a cast composed entirely of young performers and earned her a **National Youth Theatre Association Award**.\n\n## Career\n\n### 2008–2013: Nickelodeon roles and music debut\n\nIn 2008, Ariana Grande debuted on Broadway as Charlotte in the musical *13*, which explored the challenges faced by a 13-year-old boy relocating from New York to Indiana and premiered on October 16, running until January 4, 2009. The production featured an all-youth cast and earned Grande a National Youth Theatre Association Award for her role.\n\nTransitioning to television, Grande was cast as Cat Valentine, a bubbly and eccentric character with a traumatic backstory involving a strict brother, in Nickelodeon's *Victorious*, which premiered on March 27, 2010, and aired for four seasons until February 2013. The series followed aspiring performers at a performing arts high school and co-starred actors including Victoria Justice and Elizabeth Gillies, the latter also from *13*. Grande's portrayal of Cat, complete with dyed red hair to match the character's appearance, contributed to the show's popularity among young audiences.\n\nIn parallel with her acting, Grande pursued music, signing with Republic Records in 2011. Her debut single, \"Put Your Hearts Up,\" produced by Matt Squire and sampling 4 Non Blondes' \"What's Up?,\" was released on December 12, 2011, targeting a younger demographic with its upbeat, bubblegum pop style. The music video, directed by Meiert Avis and Jeremy Alter, was filmed on November 23, 2011, and later uploaded to YouTube.\n\nGrande later expressed dissatisfaction with the single's direction, viewing it as misaligned with her artistic vision, which influenced a shift toward R\\u0026B for her debut album. *Yours Truly*, featuring doo-wop and 1950s-inspired elements, was released on August 30, 2013, debuting at number one on the Billboard 200 chart with lead single \"The Way\" featuring Mac Miller topping the Hot R\\u0026B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. The album's success marked her transition from child actress to recording artist, selling over 220,000 copies in its first week.\n\n### 2013–2015: Yours Truly and breakthrough success\n\nAriana Grande released her debut studio album, *Yours Truly*, on August 30, 2013, via Republic Records. The record, comprising 12 tracks influenced by 1950s doo-wop and 1990s R\\u0026B, debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 138,000 copies in its first week and marking the highest debut week for a female pop album since 2010. It achieved platinum certification from the RIAA for one million units shipped in the United States and has sold over 500,000 pure copies domestically as of later estimates.\n\nThe album's lead single, \"The Way\" featuring Mac Miller, was released on March 26, 2013, debuting at number 10 and peaking at number nine on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Grande's breakthrough hit with over four million digital sales in the US. Follow-up singles included \"Baby I,\" released July 22, 2013, which reached number 21 on the Hot 100 and sold over one million copies, and \"Right There\" featuring Big Sean, issued January 14, 2014, peaking at number 84. Critics praised Grande's four-octave vocal range on the album, often drawing comparisons to Mariah Carey for its technical prowess and emotive delivery.\n\nTo promote *Yours Truly*, Grande embarked on her debut concert tour, The Listening Sessions, from August 13 to September 22, 2013, performing 11 shows across North America in intimate theater venues. The tour grossed $679,360 and featured full renditions of album tracks like \"Honeymoon Avenue,\" \"Tattooed Heart,\" and \"Daydreamin'.\" In recognition of her rapid ascent, Grande won the New Artist of the Year award at the 2013 American Music Awards on November 24, 2013. These milestones established Grande as a prominent pop artist transitioning from television roles to music stardom.\n\n### 2015–2018: My Everything, Dangerous Woman, and Sweetener amid challenges\n\nGrande's second studio album *My Everything*, released on August 25, 2014, continued to generate success into 2015 through singles such as \"One Last Time,\" which peaked at number 13 on the Billboard Hot 100, and the collaborative track \"Bang Bang\" with Jessie J and Nicki Minaj, reaching number three. In support, she launched her first headlining concert tour, the Honeymoon Tour, commencing on February 25, 2015, in Albany, New York, and concluding on October 25, 2015, in São Paulo, Brazil, with 99 shows across North America, Europe, Asia, and South America, grossing over $26.3 million.\n\nHer third studio album, *Dangerous Woman*, arrived on May 20, 2016, via Republic Records, featuring singles including the title track, which debuted at number 10 on the Billboard Hot 100, \"Into You\" peaking at number 13, and \"Side to Side\" featuring Nicki Minaj, reaching number four. The album debuted at number two on the Billboard 200, selling 175,000 equivalent album units in its first week. The Dangerous Woman Tour began on February 3, 2017, in Phoenix, Arizona, and was set to span multiple continents.\n\nOn May 22, 2017, a suicide bombing by Islamist terrorist Salman Abedi occurred in the Manchester Arena foyer immediately after Grande's concert, killing 22 civilians, mostly young fans, and injuring 139 others. Grande suspended the tour and returned to the United States, later expressing profound guilt and trauma, stating in 2018 that she believed she would \"never\" fully process the event and suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In response, she organized the One Love Manchester benefit concert on June 4, 2017, at Old Trafford Cricket Ground, featuring performances by Grande, Coldplay, Justin Bieber, Katy Perry, and others, which drew 55,000 attendees and raised over £17 million for victims and families through the We Love Manchester Emergency Fund. Grande resumed the Dangerous Woman Tour on June 7, 2017, in Louisville, Kentucky, completing it on September 21, 2017, in Hong Kong, with enhanced security measures.\n\nGrande's fourth studio album, *Sweetener*, was released on August 17, 2018, debuting at number one on the Billboard 200 with 231,000 equivalent album units, marking her first chart-topping album and generating 126.7 million on-demand streams in its debut week, the highest for a female artist at the time. Lead single \"No Tears Left to Cry\" debuted at number one on the Hot 100 Digital Songs chart, while \"God is a Woman\" peaked at number eight on the Hot 100; the album's production, beginning in 2016 with collaborators like Pharrell Williams and Max Martin, incorporated themes of resilience and healing influenced by the Manchester attack.\n\n### 2018–2020: Thank U, Next and Positions\n\nFollowing the release of *Sweetener* in August 2018, Grande experienced a series of personal upheavals, including her breakup with rapper Mac Miller in May 2018 after two years together, a rapid engagement to comedian Pete Davidson in June 2018, and Miller's death from an accidental overdose in September 2018. These events, compounded by public scrutiny, influenced the thematic vulnerability of her subsequent work, with Grande later describing the *Thank U, Next* era as a period of \"dark times\" and the album's creation as a \"means of survival.\"\n\nGrande surprise-released the title track \"Thank U, Next\" on November 3, 2018, which debuted at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, marking her first chart-topper as a lead artist. The song's introspective lyrics addressing past relationships and personal growth propelled the full album, recorded primarily between October and December 2018 in a compressed two-week span fueled by emotional intensity. *Thank U, Next* was released on February 8, 2019, via Republic Records, debuting at number one on the Billboard 200 with 360,000 equivalent album units in its first week—the strongest sales week of Grande's career at that point, comprising 116,000 pure album sales and substantial streaming volume. It held the top spot for a second week before declining, reflecting strong initial commercial momentum driven by hits like \"7 Rings,\" released January 18, 2019, which also reached number one on the Hot 100 and became one of her signature tracks. The third single, \"Break Up with Your Girlfriend, I’m Bored,\" accompanied the album drop and peaked at number two, enabling Grande to occupy the entire top three positions on the Hot 100 simultaneously—a historic feat.\n\nCritics praised *Thank U, Next* for its emotional depth, lighter tone relative to prior releases, and Grande's vocal delivery amid adversity, with outlets like Pitchfork and Variety hailing it as one of the year's strongest pop albums and the best-reviewed project of her career to date. The album supported an extension of Grande's Sweetener World Tour, which incorporated its material and ran from March to December 2019, grossing over $100 million across 97 dates despite no new dedicated outing. Grande performed selections from the album at the 62nd Grammy Awards on January 26, 2020, though it received no wins despite nominations for Best Pop Vocal Album and Best Pop Solo Performance for \"7 Rings.\"\n\nShifting toward recovery and new romance, Grande released her sixth studio album *Positions* on October 30, 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, which precluded touring but aligned with a focus on introspective R\\u0026B-inflected pop exploring relationships and self-repair. The lead single \"Positions,\" dropped October 23, 2020, debuted at number one on the Hot 100, Grande's fifth such entry and third consecutive 2020 chart-topper. The album debuted atop the Billboard 200 with 174 million on-demand streams in its opening week, securing her fifth number-one project overall, though pure sales were lower at around 42,000 units amid streaming dominance. Follow-up singles \"34+35\" and \"POV\" charted modestly within the top 10 and top 40, respectively, with the full set generating sustained streaming but less explosive single breakthroughs than its predecessor.\n\nReception for *Positions* was generally positive but more divided, with Pitchfork noting its balance of romance and personal piecing-together, while some critics described it as a campy, upbeat collection lacking the prior era's raw edge; Grande later reflected that the response felt like \"bullying,\" highlighting perceived underappreciation relative to expectations. Commercial longevity persisted through variants like vinyl reissues, but the album earned no Grammy wins, underscoring a pattern where Grande's rapid output yielded critical acclaim yet limited major award recognition during this period.\n\n### 2021–2023: Collaborations and career reflections\n\nIn early 2021, Grande released a remix of her track \"34+35\" from the album *Positions*, featuring Doja Cat and Megan Thee Stallion, on January 15. The remix, which incorporated rap verses from the featured artists, peaked at number eight on the US Billboard Hot 100 and supported the deluxe edition of *Positions*. Later that year, on April 23, she collaborated with The Weeknd on a remix of his single \"Save Your Tears\" from the album *After Hours*, adding her vocals to the chorus and bridge. This version debuted at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, marking Grande's fifth chart-topping single and The Weeknd's fifth, while the pair performed it live at the 2021 iHeartRadio Music Awards on May 27.\n\nGrande maintained a lower profile in new music output through 2022, with no solo singles or full-length albums released during this time, shifting focus away from intensive recording and touring schedules that characterized prior years. In 2023, she reunited with The Weeknd for a remix of \"Die For You\" from his 2016 album *Starboy*, released on February 24, which blended their vocal harmonies and propelled the track to number one on the Billboard Hot 100 after viral resurgence on social media platforms like TikTok. Later that year, on August 25, Grande issued a tenth anniversary edition of her 2013 debut album *Yours Truly*, expanding the original tracklist with six bonus recordings, including live versions of \"Honeymoon Avenue\" and \"Daydreamin'\" performed acoustically. This reissue highlighted archival material from her early career, underscoring her evolution from teen pop beginnings.\n\nThroughout 2021–2023, Grande shared introspective comments on her professional trajectory in public statements, emphasizing personal growth amid reduced output. In a December 2023 Instagram post, she described the year as \"one of the most transformative, most challenging, and yet happiest and most special years of my life,\" attributing shifts to life experiences rather than explicit career dissatisfaction. She also addressed perceptions of her public image, stating in the same reflection that she felt \"misunderstood\" by some narratives, while prioritizing selective collaborations over prolific releases to sustain vocal health and artistic control. This period marked a deliberate pause in solo projects, allowing preparation for subsequent endeavors like her role in the *Wicked* film adaptation, though she avoided detailing burnout explicitly in favor of framing it as intentional recalibration.\n\n### 2024–present: Eternal Sunshine, Wicked, and touring return\n\nGrande released her seventh studio album, *Eternal Sunshine*, on March 8, 2024, through Republic Records. The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart, holding the top position for its first two weeks, and achieved a fifth number-one ranking on the UK Albums Chart. A deluxe edition, titled *Eternal Sunshine Deluxe: Brighter Days Ahead*, followed on March 28, 2025, propelling the project back to number one on the Billboard 200 from position 87 and topping album sales, current album sales, and vinyl album charts.\n\nIn November 2024, Grande portrayed Glinda in the film adaptation of *Wicked*, directed by Jon M. Chu, which premiered on November 22 and starred Cynthia Erivo as Elphaba. The musical fantasy grossed over $755 million worldwide by May 2025, becoming the highest-grossing film adaptation of a Broadway musical. It earned the Cinematic and Box Office Achievement award at the 2025 Golden Globes and a win for Grande in Supporting Film Performance of the Year at the Dorian Awards. A sequel, *Wicked: For Good*, featuring Grande's continued role, was released in theaters on November 21, 2025.\n\nGrande announced *The Eternal Sunshine Tour*, her fourth headlining arena tour supporting the album, on August 28, 2025, with initial dates in North America and London starting June 5, 2026, in Oakland, California. Additional North American shows were added in September 2025, spanning 10 cities including Los Angeles and concluding in London. This marks her return to touring after a pause, with no performances scheduled for 2025.\n## Artistry\n\n### Musical style and production\n\nAriana Grande's musical style centers on contemporary R\\u0026B and pop, frequently blending mid-tempo grooves with electronic elements and hip-hop cadences. Her early work, such as the 2013 album *Yours Truly*, evoked 1990s R\\u0026B through melismatic runs and layered harmonies reminiscent of Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston, artists she has cited as key vocal influences since uploading covers of their songs during her Nickelodeon tenure. Later releases like *Positions* (2020) shifted toward intimate, atmospheric R\\u0026B with precise hooks and full vocal range exploration, including whistle register notes, while incorporating house and disco stylings in tracks like those on *Eternal Sunshine* (2024).\n\nIn production, Grande collaborates extensively with Swedish hitmakers Max Martin and Ilya Salmanzadeh, who craft minimalistic arrangements to spotlight her vocals, as in the haunting setup of \"no tears left to cry\" from *Sweetener* (2018). Multiple producers often contribute to single tracks, with Grande exerting significant creative control, including self-directing vocal arrangements and layering, as demonstrated in her breakdown of producing \"Stuck with U\" (2020) with Justin Bieber. For *Eternal Sunshine*, coproducer Nick Lee assisted in building lavish, adventurous melodies around romantic themes, emphasizing electronic atmospheres over dense instrumentation. This approach prioritizes vocal prominence and emotional intimacy, yielding hook-driven pop structures that have sustained her chart dominance.\n\n### Influences and songwriting\n\nGrande has identified **Mariah Carey** and **Whitney Houston** as her primary vocal influences, particularly admiring Carey's melismatic phrasing and whistle register, which she emulated in early YouTube covers uploaded during her *Victorious* tenure around 2010–2012. She has also credited Houston's emotive power and range for shaping her delivery, as evidenced by her renditions of tracks like \"I Have Nothing\" in Broadway auditions as early as 2008. Additional inspirations include 1990s urban pop acts and Gloria Estefan, whose Miami Sound Machine performances motivated Grande to pursue singing professionally after attending a concert in her youth. Her broader palette extends to Madonna for pop innovation and Imogen Heap for electronic production elements, influencing stylistic shifts across albums from *Yours Truly* (2013) to *Eternal Sunshine* (2024).\n\nGrande's songwriting emphasizes personal introspection, often originating from journal entries or immediate emotional responses to life events, as in the rapid composition of *Thank U, Next* (2019) following her breakup with Pete Davidson in 2018, where phrases like the title track's hook derived from conversations with friend Victoria Monét. She collaborates closely with producers such as Max Martin and Ilya Salmanzadeh, contributing lyrics and melodies in studio sessions that prioritize vocal layering and thematic vulnerability, evident in co-credits on hits like \"7 Rings\" (2019), which interpolates 1990s R\\u0026B motifs while addressing financial independence post-divorce. On *Eternal Sunshine*, released March 8, 2024, Grande holds writing credits on all 13 tracks—sole lyrical authorship on seven, including \"Bye\" and \"Supernatural\"—reflecting a streamlined process focused on synth-pop introspection amid her separation from Dalton Gomez, finalized October 2023. Critics note her evolution from early reliance on external writers for *Yours Truly* to greater autonomy, though production teams remain integral for commercial polish.\n\n### Vocal technique and range\n\nAriana Grande's vocal range extends approximately four octaves, typically from D3 in her chest register to E7 in whistle register, enabling her to navigate low smoky tones and extreme high frequencies. This span, verified through analyses of her recordings, positions her as a light-lyric soprano capable of intricate melismas and rapid note transitions.\n\nHer technique emphasizes agility and register blending, utilizing light mix voice for mid-range belts and head voice for sustained highs, honed from early musical theater training. Grande frequently employs whistle register—a falsetto extension producing flute-like tones—for embellishments in songs such as \"Imagine\" (2018) and \"Emotions\" (2020), where she reaches E7 with clarity and control. This register, requiring precise breath support and minimal vocal fold tension, distinguishes her from peers but has drawn critique for occasional over-reliance, potentially masking limitations in full-chest belting power during live unamplified performances.\n\nIn 2013, Grande experienced a vocal fold hemorrhage from overuse, resulting in a two-week singing ban and subsequent adjustments to her phonation for recovery, which some analyses link to a shift toward lighter, higher-placed resonance in her speaking and singing voice. Post-recovery, her approach incorporates forward oral placement to reduce strain, enhancing endurance for extended tours and roles like Glinda in the 2024 film *Wicked*, where she sustains demanding soprano lines up to B5 and beyond. Vocal coaches note her proficiency in modulating timbre—from breathy intimacy to bright projection—though empirical assessments highlight variability in low-end resonance compared to her upper extensions.\n\n## Public image\n\n### Persona evolution and media coverage\n\nAriana Grande's public persona initially emerged from her role as Cat Valentine on Nickelodeon series *Victorious* (2010–2013) and *Sam \\u0026 Cat* (2013–2014), portraying a bubbly, ditzy character with high ponytails and a high-pitched voice that blended into her early music image as a teen pop artist. This girl-next-door aesthetic, marked by colorful outfits and youthful exuberance, aligned with her debut album *Yours Truly* in 2013, which signaled a rebranding toward a more mature yet still innocent pop sensibility. By 2015, media scrutiny intensified following the \"donut licking\" incident at a California bakery, where footage showed Grande licking a donut and criticizing American food culture, challenging her wholesome facade and prompting outlets to question her authenticity amid her rising fame.\n\nAs her career progressed into the late 2010s, Grande's image evolved toward a sexier, empowered pop diva with albums like *Dangerous Woman* (2016) and *Sweetener* (2018), incorporating edgier fashion and themes of independence, influenced by personal tragedies including the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing at her concert, which killed 22 and shifted media narratives to resilience while fueling debates on her vulnerability. Post-2018, releases such as *Thank U, Next* (2019) and *Positions* (2020) reflected a more introspective and relatable persona, addressing breakups and mental health, though critics and online discourse accused her of performative shifts, including adopting a lower speaking voice and altered mannerisms perceived as inauthentic or imitative of hip-hop culture. Media coverage often highlighted these changes, with tabloids speculating on cosmetic procedures like fillers contributing to a \"gaunt\" or racially ambiguous appearance, amplifying \"blackfishing\" allegations despite her Italian heritage, while her career resilience suggested such controversies had limited commercial impact.\n\nIn recent years, particularly around her role as Glinda in the 2024 film *Wicked*, Grande has described her pop star persona as a deliberate \"character,\" explaining voice modulation—higher for performances and press to protect her vocal cords, lower in private—as a professional adaptation rather than deception. This revelation drew mixed media reactions, with some praising her candor on tabloid pressures and \"cringe\" culture's unfairness, while others, including fan communities, critiqued it as evidence of fragmented identity or over-reliance on manufactured images. Coverage has increasingly focused on body-shaming and appearance policing, which Grande has publicly condemned as harmful, noting societal normalization of such commentary amid her shift to a more glamorous, Broadway-inspired aesthetic. Despite pervasive online snark and authenticity debates, empirical metrics like sustained chart success indicate media portrayals have not derailed her trajectory, underscoring a pattern where personal evolutions are scrutinized more intensely than professional outputs.\n\n### Fanbase dynamics and cultural impact\n\nAriana Grande's fanbase, self-identified as the Arianators, demonstrates high levels of dedication through substantial social media engagement and concert attendance. As of October 2025, Grande maintains approximately 373 million followers on Instagram, reflecting a broad and active online community that amplifies her releases and public appearances. Her tours underscore this loyalty; the Sweetener World Tour (2019) drew 1.3 million attendees across 97 shows, grossing $146.6 million, while the Eternal Sunshine Tour announced in 2025 saw over 1 million users attempting to secure tickets for initial dates, indicating sustained demand.\n\nFan dynamics reveal both supportive mobilization and internal tensions. Arianators have organized voter registration drives at concerts, with the Sweetener Tour setting a record of 33,381 registrations through HeadCount, surpassing prior benchmarks for artist-led civic engagement. However, Grande has described her relationship with fans as \"hard,\" noting in September 2024 that their actions sometimes \"hurt my feelings\" despite her enduring affection for them. Her manager highlighted fandom toxicity in January 2025 as a key career challenge, attributing it to fans' perceived \"sense of ownership\" over artists' personal lives, which can manifest in harassment or overzealous defense against critics. Instances include fans targeting individuals who share negative anecdotes about Grande, such as flooding actress Elvira's Instagram with backlash after a 2023 story about an unfavorable encounter.\n\nGrande's cultural impact extends to shaping pop music aesthetics and youth trends via her vocal agility and visual branding. Her signature high ponytail, originating from practical needs for damaged hair around 2013 and evolving into a teased, elevated style, has become emblematic of her persona and influenced fashion accessibility for fans emulating the look. In music, her blend of R\\u0026B-infused pop and whistle register techniques has positioned her as a benchmark for contemporary vocalists, contributing to Billboard's recognition of her as the sixth greatest pop star of 2024 for multifaceted influence across recordings, film, and performance. Social media savvy, including strategic posts and fan interactions, has further embedded her in digital culture, driving trends in beauty and self-presentation among younger demographics.\n\n### Criticisms of authenticity and commercialism\n\nCritics have questioned the authenticity of Ariana Grande's public persona, particularly her adoption of vocal inflections and stylistic elements associated with Black R\\u0026B artists, which some describe as a calculated enhancement of marketability rather than organic expression. In 2018, following the release of \"Thank U, Next,\" online commentators and media outlets accused her of using a \"blaccent\"—a perceived imitation of African American Vernacular English—in interviews and performances, arguing it served to broaden her appeal in urban music genres without deeper cultural engagement. This drew parallels to broader debates on white artists profiting from Black cultural aesthetics, with The Telegraph noting in 2024 that her evolving R\\u0026B sound, music videos, and speech patterns fueled perceptions of performative borrowing for commercial gain. Grande responded in a 2019 interview, asserting that such criticisms overlooked her consistent artistic influences and dismissed the \"fake\" label as misunderstanding her genuine self-expression.\n\nHer musical output has faced scrutiny for prioritizing commercial viability over artistic innovation, with reviewers pointing to repetitive structures and production choices that align closely with chart-topping formulas. A 2024 critique of *Eternal Sunshine* highlighted how tracks like \"yes, and?\" adhered to \"formulaic pop structure,\" limiting emotional nuance in favor of radio-friendly hooks and beats designed for streaming success. Earlier, a 2014 Forbes analysis challenged the hype around her vocal prowess, claiming live performances revealed limitations compared to studio-polished recordings, suggesting her image as an unrivaled belter relied on auto-tune and post-production to sustain mass appeal. Such views posit that Grande's rapid album cycles—often tied to personal upheavals like breakups—function as publicity mechanisms, as seen with *Thank U, Next* in 2019, which capitalized on tabloid drama to achieve over 3 billion Spotify streams while critics argued it favored viral moments over substantive evolution.\n\nThese critiques often emanate from music journalists and online discourse, though Grande's defenders, including Rolling Stone in 2024, frame her approach as a deliberate refinement of pop conventions that has yielded consistent commercial dominance, with seven No. 1 Billboard Hot 100 singles by 2024. Nonetheless, the emphasis on branding shifts—from ponytail icon to mature seductress—has led some to view her career as emblematic of industry-driven commodification, where authenticity yields to fan engagement metrics and endorsement deals exceeding $100 million annually.\n\n## Controversies\n\n### Early incidents and public behavior\n\nIn 2013, shortly after the conclusion of her Nickelodeon series *Victorious*, Grande publicly attributed the show's cancellation to co-star Victoria Justice's desire for a solo tour, a claim that fueled perceptions of interpersonal tensions on set. Reports emerged of Grande exhibiting demanding behavior during promotional activities, including requests to be photographed exclusively from her left side and avoidance of certain interview topics, which media outlets described as indicative of emerging diva tendencies. \n\nBy 2014, accounts of Grande's professional conduct intensified, with sources alleging she required extensive rider specifications for appearances—such as specific lighting, wardrobe accommodations, and entourage protocols—likened by industry insiders to preparations for a presidential visit. Additional allegations included instances of rudeness toward fans at meet-and-greets and contest winners, as well as skipping scheduled fan interactions, contributing to early narratives of entitlement amid her rising music career. These reports, often from tabloid and entertainment outlets, contrasted with her public persona but lacked independent corroboration beyond anonymous sourcing.\n\nA pivotal early incident occurred on July 7, 2015, when surveillance footage from Wolfee Donuts in Woodland Hills, California, captured Grande licking and spitting on unattended doughnuts before purchase, followed by her audible remarks, \"I hate Americans\" and \"disgusting,\" directed at patrons consuming the pastries.  The Los Angeles Police Department investigated for potential vandalism and trespassing but declined to press charges after review. Grande issued a video apology on July 9, 2015, expressing regret for her \"inexcusable\" actions and clarifying her disdain targeted processed foods rather than individuals, though the event amplified scrutiny of her public comportment.\n\n### Cultural appropriation and representation claims\n\nIn January 2019, rapper Princess Nokia accused Ariana Grande of cultural appropriation in the song \"7 Rings,\" claiming that its lyrical hook—\"I want it, I got it\"—directly echoed her 2017 track \"Mine,\" which addressed experiences of brown women with hair and beauty standards. Nokia shared a comparative video on social media, arguing that Grande, as a white artist, profited from elements rooted in hip-hop and minority cultural narratives without attribution. Grande responded via Instagram, acknowledging broader influences from hip-hop but stating she was unaware of Nokia's specific work and apologizing for any perceived oversight in crediting genre inspirations.\n\nThe \"7 Rings\" music video drew further criticism for incorporating Japanese trap beats and visuals, including gold grills and kanji-inspired text, which some viewed as superficial borrowing from Asian and hip-hop aesthetics without cultural depth or collaboration. Grande had previously faced scrutiny for a 2018 tattoo intended to read \"small universe\" in Japanese but mistranslated as resembling \"barbecue grill,\" highlighting recurring claims of insensitive engagement with non-Western symbols.\n\nGrande has faced persistent allegations of \"blackfishing,\" involving her tanned skin, high ponytail hairstyle, and adoption of African American Vernacular English (AAVE) speech patterns, which critics argue allow her to emulate Black aesthetics for commercial gain while evading associated hardships. These claims peaked around her shift to R\\u0026B-infused pop in the mid-2010s, with observers noting her vocal fry and slang as mimicking Black artists like those in hip-hop and soul genres, despite her Italian-American heritage. In 2018, singer Patti LaBelle referred to Grande as a \"white black girl\" following her performance at Aretha Franklin's funeral, citing her stylistic emulation of Black musical traditions.\n\nGrande has attributed her vocal style to training and influences from artists like Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston, both of whom blend pop with R\\u0026B elements, and described tanning as a performance necessity rather than intentional misrepresentation. Representation critiques extend to perceptions that her career benefits from ambiguous ethnic presentation, potentially confusing audiences about her background, though Grande has not publicly altered her approach in response to these claims. Such controversies, often amplified on social media, have elicited defenses framing them as standard artistic evolution in pop music, which historically draws from diverse sources, but have not significantly impacted her commercial success.\n\n### Relationship scandals and personal conduct allegations\n\nAriana Grande's relationship with rapper Big Sean, which lasted from 2014 to 2015, drew allegations of infidelity after reports emerged that it overlapped with Sean's engagement to actress Naya Rivera. Rivera later claimed in her 2016 memoir that she discovered text messages between Grande and Sean, leading to accusations that Grande contributed to the end of her engagement.\n\nGrande dated Mac Miller from 2016 to 2018, a period she later described as \"toxic\" in a May 2018 Twitter statement, citing Miller's struggles with substance abuse and her efforts to support his sobriety over the years. Following their breakup in May 2018, Miller faced a DUI arrest that month and died of an accidental overdose in September 2018; some online commentators blamed Grande for his decline, prompting her to deny cheating allegations and affirm her ongoing care for him.\n\nIn June 2018, shortly after Miller's DUI, Grande became engaged to comedian Pete Davidson after dating for weeks, a rapid timeline criticized amid her recent breakup and the timing near Miller's legal troubles. The engagement ended in October 2018 after four months, with sources citing Grande feeling overwhelmed; Davidson's onstage jokes, including one about switching her birth control with Tic Tacs, fueled public scrutiny of the relationship's impulsivity.\n\nGrande married real estate agent Dalton Gomez in May 2021 after dating since early 2020, but filed for divorce in September 2023 following two years of marriage marked by limited public details. Their separation coincided with reports of her involvement with Wicked co-star Ethan Slater, whose own marriage to Lilly Jay ended amid allegations of an affair; sources indicated Grande and Slater's romance began on set in December 2022, overlapping with both their marriages, and Jay had given birth weeks before the split was reported in July 2023. Grande addressed cheating rumors in a September 2024 interview, emphasizing mutual separations, though tabloid coverage labeled her a \"homewrecker\" based on the compressed timelines.\n\nOn personal conduct, Grande faced backlash in July 2015 after surveillance video from a California donut shop showed her licking an unpurchased donut and stating, \"I hate America,\" remarks interpreted as entitled and unpatriotic; she apologized, attributing the comment to concerns over modified foods rather than broader disdain. Reports from 2014 onward have alleged diva-like behavior, including rudeness to fans at meet-and-greets, demands for specific interview restrictions, and difficult on-set interactions, though Grande has not directly responded to these claims.\n\n## Achievements\n\n### Awards and nominations\n\nAriana Grande has received 18 Grammy Award nominations, winning twice: Best Pop Vocal Album for *Sweetener* in 2019 and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance for \"Rain on Me\" with Lady Gaga in 2021. In 2025, she earned three further nominations for *Eternal Sunshine*, including Best Pop Vocal Album, Best Pop Duo/Group Performance for the remix of \"The Boy Is Mine\" with Brandy and Monica, and Best Dance/Electronic Recording for \"Yes, And?\", though she did not win or attend the ceremony. \n\nAt the MTV Video Music Awards, Grande secured three wins in 2025 for \"brighter days ahead\": Video of the Year, Best Pop, and Best Longform Video.  She has previously won Artist of the Year and other categories, such as at the 2019 ceremony where she took three awards from 12 nominations. In music publishing recognition, she was named Songwriter of the Year at the 2025 SESAC Latin Music Awards.\n\nFor her performance as Glinda in the 2024 film *Wicked*, Grande received her first Academy Award nomination, along with Golden Globe, BAFTA, and SAG nominations. For her role in the sequel *Wicked: For Good*, she received a nomination for Best Supporting Actress at the 2026 Critics Choice Awards. She also won Favorite Movie Actress and Favorite Song from a Movie at the 2025 Kids' Choice Awards. Earlier accolades include two Billboard Music Awards in 2019 for Chart Achievement and Top Hot 100 Artist, from nine nominations that year.\n\n| Ceremony | Total Wins | Notable Wins |\n|----------|------------|--------------|\n| Grammy Awards | 2 | Best Pop Vocal Album (*Sweetener*, 2019); Best Pop Duo/Group Performance (\"Rain on Me\", 2021) |\n| MTV Video Music Awards | Multiple (including 3 in 2025) | Video of the Year (\"brighter days ahead\", 2025); Artist of the Year (2019) |\n| American Music Awards | 3 | Artist of the Year (2019); Favorite Pop/Rock Artist (multiple years) |\n| Billboard Music Awards | 2 | Top Hot 100 Artist (2019); Chart Achievement Award (2019)\n### Sales records and chart performance\n\nAriana Grande has achieved nine number-one singles on the Billboard Hot 100, including \"Thank U, Next\" (2019), \"7 Rings\" (2019), \"Stuck with U\" (2020), \"Positions\" (2020), \"Yes, And?\" (2024), and \"We Can't Be Friends (Wait for Your Love)\" (2024), tying her for ninth-most leaders among all artists in the 21st century. She has charted 96 songs on the Hot 100, the fourth-most entries by a female artist, with 23 top-10 hits. Grande holds the Guinness World Record as the first solo artist to occupy the top three positions simultaneously on the Hot 100, accomplished in February 2019 with \"7 Rings\" at number one, \"Break Up with Your Girlfriend, I'm Bored\" at number two, and \"Thank U, Next\" at number three. She also set records for the most simultaneous top-three debut positions and the most Hot 100 songs to debut at number one by a female artist, reaching at least seven such debuts by 2024.\n\nGrande's albums have consistently topped charts, with all seven studio releases certified platinum or higher by the RIAA as of September 2024, reflecting over one million units each in the United States under the program's inclusion of streams and track equivalents. Her 2024 album *Eternal Sunshine* debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, selling 376,000 equivalent album units in its first week. Worldwide, Grande's discography has generated over 93.6 million equivalent album units as of late 2024, led by *My Everything* (2014) with 17.7 million units, though pure sales for that album totaled only 2.3 million amid the rise of streaming.\n\nIn the United States, Grande's lead singles have surpassed 100 million RIAA-certified units, marking her as the fifth female artist to reach this threshold. Standout certifications include \"7 Rings\" at diamond (10 million units), \"The Way\" (2013) at 6× platinum, and \"No Tears Left to Cry\" (2018) eligible for 9× platinum. These figures incorporate digital downloads, physical sales, and streaming equivalents (1,500 on-demand streams equaling one unit), which have significantly boosted totals since the mid-2010s but differ from traditional pure sales metrics.\n\n## Philanthropy\n\n### Charitable initiatives\n\nAriana Grande organized the One Love Manchester benefit concert on June 4, 2017, at Old Trafford Cricket Ground, following the May 22 Manchester Arena bombing at her earlier concert, which killed 22 people. The event, attended by approximately 50,000 people and broadcast globally, featured performances by Grande and artists including Coldplay, Justin Bieber, and Katy Perry, raising about $13 million for the We Love Manchester Emergency Fund managed by the British Red Cross to support victims and families.  Additional funds, exceeding £17 million in total from public donations, ticket sales, and the re-release of her single \"One Last Time,\" were directed to the same emergency relief efforts.\n\nIn response to the same tragedy, Grande has made annual Christmas donations to the Royal Manchester Children's Hospital since at least 2020, providing toys, vouchers, and gifts to pediatric patients. In December 2021, she donated nearly 1,000 presents to children and teenagers receiving treatment there.  This tradition continued in December 2024, with a substantial gift donation ensuring holiday items for babies, children, and teens hospitalized across Manchester's network amid ongoing recovery needs from the attack. \n\nGrande donated the net proceeds from her June 8, 2017, concert in Atlanta—estimated at $250,000—to Planned Parenthood, supporting the organization's health services amid debates over its funding and operations. She also directed royalties from the 2020 single \"Stuck with U\" (with Justin Bieber), released during the COVID-19 pandemic, to the First Responders Children's Foundation to aid families of frontline workers. In April 2022, Grande pledged $1.5 million through the Pledge platform to the Protect \\u0026 Defend Trans Youth Fund, aimed at countering U.S. state-level anti-transgender legislation restricting youth medical interventions and sports participation.\n\n### Responses to tragedies and activism scrutiny\n\nFollowing the Manchester Arena bombing on May 22, 2017, which killed 22 people and injured over 1,100 during her Dangerous Woman Tour concert, Ariana Grande visited hospitalized victims within days of the attack. She canceled the remaining European dates of her tour and announced a benefit concert, One Love Manchester, held on June 4, 2017, at Emirates Old Trafford stadium. The event, attended by approximately 55,000 people with 14,000 tickets reserved for original concert attendees and their families, featured performances by Grande and artists including Coldplay, Justin Bieber, Katy Perry, Liam Gallagher, and Take That; it raised over £10 million (about $13 million USD at the time) for the We Love Manchester Emergency Fund administered by the British Red Cross to support victims and families.  In recognition of these efforts, Manchester city council named Grande its first honorary citizen on July 12, 2017.\n\nGrande has maintained ongoing support for Manchester, including sending Christmas gifts and donations to local children's hospitals in 2022, five years after the bombing, as part of continued philanthropy tied to the tragedy. Her public statements emphasized resilience, stating after the event, \"Our response to this violence must be to come closer together, to help each other, to love more, to sing louder and to live more kindly.\" These actions received widespread praise for demonstrating direct, tangible aid rather than symbolic gestures, with funds distributed to affected families for medical, psychological, and financial needs.\n\nGrande's broader activism, including advocacy for mental health awareness, LGBTQ+ rights, animal welfare, and environmental causes, has generally faced limited scrutiny compared to her personal or commercial controversies. Supporters credit her with consistent engagement, such as donating proceeds from songs like \"No Tears Left to Cry\" (released May 2018, shortly after the first anniversary) to the Manchester fund and promoting therapy access post-tragedy. Critics, however, have occasionally questioned the depth of celebrity activism in general, including Grande's, as potentially amplified by media visibility without proportional policy impact, though specific allegations of insincerity in her case remain unsubstantiated and overshadowed by verifiable charitable outputs. No major public backlash has emerged tying her activism directly to performative motives, with her Manchester response often cited as evidence of authenticity.\n\n## Business ventures\n\n### Endorsements and fragrances\n\nGrande has endorsed products from multiple brands throughout her career, including MAC Cosmetics, for which she served as Viva Glam ambassador starting in October 2015, promoting a dark plum lipstick and sheer pink lipgloss with proceeds benefiting HIV/AIDS initiatives. In 2016, she released a follow-up MAC Viva Glam collection featuring a shimmering neutral mauve lipglass and matte orchid pink lipstick. She signed a one-year endorsement deal with Reebok in September 2017 to promote women's workout clothing, activewear, and shoes through social media campaigns and onstage appearances, emphasizing themes of confidence and self-expression. Other partnerships include Coach handbags, T-Mobile wireless services, Givenchy fashion, and Guess apparel, contributing to her brand promotion revenue.\n\nGrande launched her own fragrance line in partnership with Luxe Brands, beginning with *Ari* in September 2015, a floral fruity scent featuring raspberry, rose, and vanilla notes. Subsequent releases include *Moonlight* (2017, a gourmand blend of lavender, peach, and cotton candy), *Cloud* (2018, a whipped cream and coconut composition), *Thank U, Next* (2019), and *R.E.M.* (2020). The line expanded with *God Is a Woman* (2018), *Sweet Like Candy* (2016), and limited editions like *Cloud Pink* (2023) and *R.E.M. Cherry Eclipse* (2024).\n\n| Fragrance | Launch Year | Key Notes |\n|-----------|-------------|-----------|\n| Ari | 2015 | Raspberry, rose, vanilla |\n| Sweet Like Candy | 2016 | Blackcurrant, whipped cream, cashmere |\n| Moonlight | 2017 | Lavender, peach, cotton candy |\n| Cloud | 2018 | Lavender, pear, whipped cream, coconut |\n| God Is a Woman | 2018 | Pear, bergamot, peony, pillow mist variant |\n| Thank U, Next | 2019 | White orchid, rose, macaron |\n| R.E.M. | 2020 | Iris, violet, vanilla |\n\nThe fragrance portfolio has generated over $1 billion in global retail sales as of 2022, with *Cloud* alone selling a bottle every 11 seconds in 2022 and contributing significantly to the line's estimated £820 million total revenue by that point. These figures reflect strong consumer demand driven by affordable pricing (typically $30–$65 per bottle) and alignment with Grande's pop image, though exact profit splits with partners like Luxe Brands remain undisclosed.\n\n### R.E.M. Beauty and other enterprises\n\nAriana Grande founded R.E.M. Beauty LLC, a cosmetics brand emphasizing a dreamy, rapid eye movement-inspired aesthetic, which launched its initial collection on November 12, 2021. The debut lineup included vegan, cruelty-free products such as liquid eyeliners priced at $16, lip glosses at $17, and brow gels at $15, all formulated without parabens, sulfates, or phthalates. Distribution began through the brand's website and expanded to retailers like Ulta Beauty and Sephora by early 2023.\n\nThe brand has released multiple collections, including limited-edition capsules tied to Grande's projects, such as the 2024 Wicked-inspired line featuring 12 multitasking products like complexion sticks and lip balms. The Wicked: For Good collection, launched at Ulta Beauty on October 5, 2025, achieved $1 million in sales within three hours of its Ulta debut, marking record-breaking performance for the brand. R.E.M. Beauty operates as Grande's primary self-owned enterprise beyond music, with no other independent business ventures publicly documented outside of endorsed collaborations and her fragrance line.\n\n## Personal life\n\n### Relationships and marriages\n\nGrande began dating actor Graham Phillips in 2010 after meeting on the Broadway production of *13*. Their relationship ended in December 2011.\n\nShe dated Australian YouTuber Jai Brooks of The Janoskians from August 2012 until their breakup in April 2014, briefly reconciling later that year before splitting permanently.\n\nGrande's relationship with rapper Big Sean started in October 2014, following their collaboration on \"Right There\"; it ended in April 2015 amid reports of infidelity on Sean's part, which he denied.\n\nFrom summer 2015 to 2016, she was involved with backup dancer Ricky Alvarez, whom she credited with saving her life after the 2017 Manchester bombing, though they had separated prior.\n\nHer two-year relationship with rapper Mac Miller began in 2016 after years of friendship; they split in May 2018 citing busy schedules, with Miller dying of an accidental overdose in September 2018. Grande publicly mourned him, later expressing regret over the breakup's public framing.\n\nIn May 2018, shortly after her split from Miller, Grande started dating comedian Pete Davidson; they became engaged in June 2018 but ended the relationship in October 2018, influenced by Miller's death and personal pressures.\n\nGrande met real estate broker Dalton Gomez in early 2020 during COVID-19 lockdowns; they began dating privately and married on May 15, 2021, in a Montecito, California ceremony. The couple separated in February 2023, with Grande filing for divorce in September 2023 citing irreconcilable differences; it was finalized on March 19, 2024, with Grande paying Gomez $1.25 million and him receiving half the net proceeds from their shared home sale. No spousal support was awarded.\n\nIn July 2023, shortly after her separation from Gomez, Grande began dating actor Ethan Slater, whom she met on the set of the film *Wicked*. Both were separating from their respective spouses at the time—Slater from Lilly Jay—and faced public scrutiny over the overlapping timelines, though representatives denied impropriety. As of October 2025, reports indicate ongoing relationship challenges, but they have appeared together publicly, including at events promoting *Wicked*.\n\n### Health struggles and mental health\n\nAriana Grande was profoundly affected by the Manchester Arena bombing on May 22, 2017, when a suicide bomber detonated an explosive device at the venue following her concert, killing 22 people and injuring over 1,000 others. In the immediate aftermath, she described herself as feeling \"broken,\" suspended her Dangerous Woman Tour, and returned to the United States, later revealing she cried for days while processing the victims' names.\n\nGrande was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) stemming from the attack, which she discussed in a June 2018 British Vogue interview, noting symptoms including flashbacks and hypervigilance. In April 2019, she posted brain scan images on Instagram Stories, highlighting physiological changes associated with PTSD and emphasizing that the condition's effects were \"not a joke.\"\n\nShe has experienced persistent anxiety and depression, exacerbated during the creation of her 2018 album *Sweetener* and 2019 album *Thank U, Next*, which she characterized in a February 2025 interview as \"dark times\" marked by intensive therapy to manage PTSD alongside grief and other emotional distress. Grande began therapy at age eight to address her parents' divorce and has continued it long-term, stating in 2018 that it \"saved my life so many times\" and advocating for its accessibility beyond crisis situations. In November 2024, she reiterated therapy's role in navigating lifelong mental health challenges, including anxiety.\n\n## Acting and performances\n\n### Television and voice work\n\nAriana Grande's television acting debut occurred in the Nickelodeon sitcom *Victorious*, where she portrayed Cat Valentine from the series premiere on March 27, 2010, through its conclusion on February 2, 2013, across four seasons and 57 episodes. The character, a student at the fictional Hollywood Arts High School for performing arts, was characterized by her ditzy personality, frequent use of a high-pitched vocal register, and unpredictable antics, contributing to the show's comedic tone centered on teen performers.\n\nGrande reprised the role of Cat Valentine in the spin-off series *Sam \\u0026 Cat*, co-starring Jennette McCurdy as Sam Puckett from the related Nickelodeon show *iCarly*, which aired 36 episodes from October 17, 2013, to July 17, 2014. The program depicted the mismatched duo operating a babysitting service called \"Sam and Cat's Super Cat Sitters,\" blending slapstick humor with episodic adventures involving their young clients. Production halted after one season, with Grande later reflecting on the experience amid broader discussions of Nickelodeon set dynamics.\n\nIn voice work for animation, Grande provided the English dubbing voice for Princess Diaspro, a recurring villainous fairy in the Nickelodeon-produced version of the Italian series *Winx Club*, appearing in seasons 3 through 5 as well as in specials from 2011 to 2013. The character, a rival to the lead Bloom, schemed to undermine the protagonists through manipulation and magical confrontations within the show's fantasy framework of fairy transformations and battles. This role marked one of her early forays into animated voicing, leveraging her vocal range for the character's haughty demeanor.\n\n### Film and stage roles\n\n) Ariana Grande's stage debut occurred in 2008 with the Broadway production of *13: The Musical*, where she portrayed Charlotte and served as understudy for Patrice.  The musical, composed by Jason Robert Brown, featured an all-youth cast and ran for 105 performances from October 16, 2008, to January 4, 2009, at the Bernard B. Jacobs Theatre. For her performance, Grande received a National Youth Theatre Association Award.\n\nIn 2016, Grande appeared as Penny Pingleton in *Hairspray Live!*, NBC's live television adaptation of the Tony Award-winning Broadway musical. The production aired on December 7, 2016, and featured Grande alongside performers such as Kristin Chenoweth and Jennifer Hudson, drawing 9.07 million viewers.\n\nGrande's feature film roles began with a voice performance as adult Laura in the animated sports comedy *Underdogs* (2013), released in the United States on October 17, 2014. She followed with a cameo as a pop star in *Zoolander 2* (2016), a sequel to the 2001 comedy, where her character is briefly assassinated during a fashion show sequence. In *Men in Black: International* (2019), she voiced a singing alien in a minor role.\n\nIn the satirical film *Don't Look Up* (2021), directed by Adam McKay and released on Netflix on December 24, 2021, Grande played Riley Bina, a young social media influencer and presidential aide involved in a publicity stunt subplot. Her most prominent film role to date is Glinda Upland (later Glinda the Good) in *Wicked* (2024), the first installment of the two-part screen adaptation of the Broadway musical, directed by Jon M. Chu and released on November 22, 2024.\n\n### Tours and live shows\n\nAriana Grande's first major concert tour, the Honeymoon Tour, supported her album *My Everything* and ran from February 25, 2015, to October 25, 2015, encompassing approximately 77 shows across North America, Europe, Asia, and South America. The tour featured opening acts such as Prince Royce and Rixton, with setlists including hits like \"Bang Bang\" and \"Problem.\"\n\nThe Dangerous Woman Tour, promoting her third studio album, commenced on February 3, 2017, and concluded on September 21, 2017, after 75 reported shows, grossing $71 million in ticket sales and attracting around 867,530 attendees.  A suicide bombing at Manchester Arena following her May 22, 2017, concert killed 22 people and injured over 1,000, prompting Grande to organize the One Love Manchester benefit concert on June 4, 2017, which drew 55,000 attendees live and peaked at 14.5 million viewers on BBC One.\n\nGrande's Sweetener World Tour, in support of *Sweetener* and *Thank U, Next*, began on March 18, 2019, in Albany, New York, and ended on December 20, 2019, in Osaka, Japan, spanning 97 shows primarily in North America and Europe, grossing $146.4 million and selling 1.3 million tickets. \n\nIn 2021, Grande headlined the Rift Tour, a virtual concert event in the video game Fortnite on August 6, 2021, viewed by over 78 million players across multiple shows. Following a hiatus from large-scale touring due to the COVID-19 pandemic, she performed select live shows, including appearances at the 2025 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. On August 28, 2025, Grande announced the Eternal Sunshine Tour, her first headlining arena tour since 2019, scheduled to begin on June 6, 2026, in Oakland, California, and conclude on September 1, 2026, in London, with 41 dates across North America and Europe. \n\nGrande has delivered numerous notable live performances at award shows and events, such as \"Bang Bang\" with Jessie J and Nicki Minaj at the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards and American Music Awards, \"God Is a Woman\" at the 2018 MTV VMAs, and \"Thank U, Next\" on *The Ellen DeGeneres Show* in 2018.\n\n## Discography\n\n### Studio albums\n\nAriana Grande's debut studio album, *Yours Truly*, was released on August 30, 2013, through Republic Records. The record drew from 1990s pop and R\\u0026B influences, featuring collaborations with artists such as Big Sean and Mac Miller on tracks like \"Right There\" and \"The Way.\" It produced three singles: \"The Way,\" which peaked at number nine on the Billboard Hot 100; \"Baby I\"; and \"Right There.\" The album sold over 220,000 copies in its first week in the United States.\n\nHer second album, *My Everything*, followed on August 25, 2014, expanding into EDM and hip-hop elements with features from Iggy Azalea, Zedd, and Big Sean.

Singles such as \"Dangerous Woman,\" \"Into You,\" and \"Side to Side\" featuring Nicki Minaj all charted in the Billboard Hot 100 top ten. The album debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 with 175,000 album-equivalent units in its first week and achieved platinum certification in multiple countries. Wait, fandom is wiki-like, avoid. Use  but no Genius for this, wait results have Spotify, Discogs.\n\nCorrection: Use  for tracklist/release implied.\n\nHer fourth album, *Sweetener*, was released on August 17, 2018, incorporating trap beats and themes of resilience post-Manchester bombing, with production from Pharrell Williams and Max Martin. It featured singles \"No Tears Left to Cry\" and \"God is a Woman,\" both top-ten Billboard Hot 100 hits. *Sweetener* debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, moving 231,000 units in its first week, and won the Grammy for Best Pop Vocal Album in 2019.\n\nThe fifth album, *Thank U, Next*, came out on February 8, 2019, just six months after *Sweetener*, focusing on personal heartbreak and self-reflection with minimalistic R\\u0026B production. Standout singles \"Thank U, Next\" and \"7 Rings\" both hit number one on the Billboard Hot 100, the latter sparking controversy over interpolation similarities to \"My Favorite Things.\" It debuted atop the Billboard 200 with 360,000 units and has sold over 2 million copies worldwide.\n\n*Positions*, her sixth studio effort, was issued on October 30, 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, emphasizing romantic and sexual themes in a trap-pop framework with features from Doja Cat and The Weeknd. The title track peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, while \"34+35\" reached number eight. The album topped the Billboard 200 in its debut week with 174,000 units.\n\nGrande's seventh album, *Eternal Sunshine*, released on March 8, 2024, explores post-breakup introspection and drew inspiration from the film *Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind*. Produced largely by Max Martin, it includes singles \"Yes, And?\" and \"We Can't Be Friends (Wait for Your Love),\" both debuting at number one on the Billboard Hot 100. The record debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 with 325,000 equivalent album units, marking her longest-charting album to date.\n\n### Singles and collaborations\n\nGrande's entry into the music industry as a recording artist began with the release of \"Put Your Hearts Up\" on December 6, 2011, through Republic Records, a cover of a Studio One song that peaked at number 23 on the Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100. Her breakthrough came with \"The Way\" featuring Mac Miller from her debut album *Yours Truly*, released as a single on March 26, 2013; it debuted at number 10 and peaked at number 9 on the Billboard Hot 100, marking her first top-10 hit.
