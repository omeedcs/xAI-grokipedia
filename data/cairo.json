Located along the Nile River in northern Egypt, Cairo serves as the political, cultural, and economic heart of the country. With a population exceeding 21 million in its metropolitan area as of 2023, it is a bustling megacity that blends ancient history with modern development. Often referred to as the \"City of a Thousand Minarets\" due to its numerous Islamic architectural landmarks, Cairo is a UNESCO World Heritage site and a global hub for history, art, and tourism [UNESCO](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/89/).\n\nCairo's significance stretches across millennia, from its roots near the ancient city of Memphis to its establishment as a center of Islamic culture in the medieval period. Today, it remains a vital nexus of politics and culture in the Arab world, while grappling with challenges such as overpopulation and infrastructure strain.\n\n## Historical Background\n\nCairo's history is deeply intertwined with the ancient and medieval narratives of Egypt. While the city itself was founded in 969 CE by the Fatimid dynasty, its location near the Nile Delta has been a focal point of human civilization for thousands of years.\n\n- **Ancient Roots**: The area around Cairo was home to the ancient city of Memphis, one of the earliest capitals of Pharaonic Egypt, established around 3100 BCE. Memphis, located just south of modern Cairo, was a political and religious center during the Old Kingdom and is near the iconic Giza Plateau, home to the Great Pyramids and the Sphinx [Britannica - Memphis](https://www.britannica.com/place/Memphis-ancient-city-Egypt).\n- **Founding of Cairo**: The city of Cairo was officially founded by the Fatimid Caliphate as their new capital. General Jawhar al-Siqilli established the city as a fortified enclosure, naming it *Al-Qāhirah*, meaning \"the Victorious.\" Its strategic position along the Nile made it a key center for trade and military control [Encyclopedia of Islam](https://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-2/cairo-COM_0101).\n- **Medieval Islamic Golden Age**: Under the Fatimids, and later the Ayyubids and Mamluks, Cairo became a thriving hub of Islamic scholarship, architecture, and commerce. The Al-Azhar Mosque, founded in 970 CE, remains one of the oldest universities in the world and a center of Sunni Islamic learning [Al-Azhar University](https://www.azhar.edu.eg/en/).\n- **Ottoman and Modern Era**: Cairo came under Ottoman rule in 1517, serving as a provincial capital until the 19th century. During the reign of Muhammad Ali Pasha in the early 1800s, the city underwent significant modernization. In the 20th century, Cairo played a central role in Egypt's struggle for independence from British colonial influence, becoming the capital of the modern Egyptian state in 1922 [BBC - Egypt History](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-13313370).\n\n## Current Status and Relevance\n\nToday, Cairo is the political and cultural epicenter of Egypt, housing the government, major universities, and key institutions. It is also a critical player in regional politics, often hosting summits of the Arab League, which is headquartered in the city [Arab League](https://www.arableagueonline.org/).\n\n- **Population and Urban Challenges**: Cairo's metropolitan area is one of the most densely populated in the world, with rapid urbanization leading to issues such as traffic congestion, pollution, and housing shortages. The Egyptian government has initiated projects like the New Administrative Capital, located east of Cairo, to alleviate these pressures [Reuters - New Capital](https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/egypt-builds-new-capital-relieve-cairos-pressure-2021-03-17/).\n- **Economic Role**: As Egypt's economic hub, Cairo contributes significantly to the national GDP through industries such as tourism, manufacturing, and services. The city is a gateway for visitors to iconic sites like the Pyramids of Giza and the Egyptian Museum [World Bank - Egypt Economy](https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/egypt/overview).\n- **Cultural Influence**: Cairo is a center for Arabic cinema, literature, and music, often dubbed the \"Hollywood of the Middle East.\" It hosts major cultural events like the Cairo International Film Festival and is home to countless historical monuments and museums [Cairo Film Festival](https://www.ciff.org.eg/).\n\n## Notable Facts and Details\n\n- **Geographic Location**: Cairo lies on both banks of the Nile River, just south of the Nile Delta. Its coordinates are approximately 30.0444° N latitude and 31.2357° E longitude, placing it in a strategic position for trade and agriculture [National Geographic](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/cairo-egypt).\n- **Historical Sites**: The city is renowned for landmarks such as the Giza Necropolis (including the Great Pyramid, a Wonder of the Ancient World), the Citadel of Saladin, and Khan el-Khalili, a historic bazaar dating back to the 14th century [UNESCO - Historic Cairo](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/89/).\n- **Climate**: Cairo has a hot desert climate, with scorching summers averaging 35°C (95°F) and mild winters around 15°C (59°F).
