# Florence Pugh

Florence Pugh (born 3 January 1996) is an English actress recognized for her versatile performances across independent cinema and commercial blockbusters.  
She rose to prominence with her debut lead role in the drama *Lady Macbeth* (2016), for which she won the British Independent Film Award for Best Actress, followed by critically acclaimed turns in horror films like *Midsommar* (2019) and period pieces such as *Little Women* (2019), earning her an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress.  
Pugh expanded into franchise roles, portraying Yelena Belova in the Marvel Cinematic Universe's *Black Widow* (2021) and subsequent projects, while continuing to star in high-profile films including *Oppenheimer* (2023) and *Dune: Part Two* (2024).  
Her career has been marked by BAFTA nominations, including for Supporting Actress in *Little Women* and as an EE Rising Star, reflecting her rapid ascent in the industry despite occasional public scrutiny over personal choices like past instances of cultural insensitivity for which she issued an apology.

## Early life

### Family background and childhood

Florence Pugh was born Florence Rose Pugh on **January 3, 1996**, in Oxford, Oxfordshire, England, to parents Clinton Pugh and Deborah Mackin. Her father, Clinton, has operated as a restaurateur in Oxford for over four decades, owning establishments such as The Grand Cafe, Kazbar, and Cafe Coco. Her mother, Deborah, worked as a professional ballet dancer and later as an aerobics instructor.

Pugh is the youngest of four siblings, with three older brothers and sisters: Toby Sebastian (born Sebastian Charles Drakopoulos), an actor and musician known for roles in *Game of Thrones*; Arabella Gibbins, an actress; and Rafferty "Raffie" Pugh, her brother. The family maintained a stable household, with her parents married for more than 26 years as of reports from the early 2020s.

Raised primarily in Oxford, Pugh experienced a brief relocation to Spain with her family during her early years before they returned to the United Kingdom. This peripatetic element of her childhood occurred against the backdrop of her parents' entrepreneurial and artistic pursuits, which included her father's restaurant ventures and her mother's dance instruction, fostering an environment conducive to creative interests later evident in her siblings' careers in acting and music.

### Education and early health challenges

Pugh attended private schools in Oxford, initially at Wychwood School from 2007 to 2009 before transferring to St Edward's School. At St Edward's, an elite boarding institution, she participated in school theater productions throughout her grades but later expressed dissatisfaction with the lack of support for her acting interests. She did not perform strongly in academics, remarking in a 2023 interview that she was not "built for school." Her film debut in *The Falling* (2014) occurred while she was still in the sixth form at St Edward's, at age 17.

During her early childhood, Pugh was diagnosed with tracheomalacia—a condition in which the tracheal walls weaken and collapse, obstructing airflow—alongside asthma, resulting in a distinct respiratory profile from infancy. The severity of her breathing difficulties prompted physicians to inform her family that survival beyond early childhood was improbable without intervention. To mitigate symptoms, her family relocated from England to Andalusia, Spain, for several years, where the warmer, drier climate improved her condition compared to the damp English environment. Pugh has recounted in subsequent interviews, including a 2022 discussion and a 2025 television appearance, how these challenges shaped her physical resilience and family dynamics from a young age.

## Career

### Initial roles and training (2012–2018)

Pugh lacked formal acting training, instead drawing from childhood participation in school plays and self-directed performances organized at home. Her innate talent and early exposure compensated for the absence of structured education in the field, as she later reflected in interviews that every initial job required on-set learning without prior classes. While attending Wychwood School and later St Edward's School in Oxford, she honed skills through informal theater but faced limited institutional support for pursuing acting professionally.

Pugh's professional screen debut occurred in 2014 at age 17 with the British mystery drama *The Falling*, directed by Carol Morley, where she portrayed Abbie Mortimer, a rebellious student amid a school's outbreak of fainting episodes, opposite Maisie Williams. She secured the role via a self-taped audition submitted without an agent or industry connections, impressing casting directors despite her inexperience; the film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 6, 2014, and received positive reviews for her poised performance as a precocious teen. The intensity of the production led her to pause acting temporarily to focus on education and personal recovery from related stress.

She returned in 2016 with the lead role of Katherine in *Lady Macbeth*, an independent period drama adaptation of Nikolai Leskov's novella, directed by William Oldroyd; filmed primarily in Northumberland, England, Pugh played a repressed wife engaging in adultery and violence on a rural estate, earning critical acclaim for her raw intensity and marking her first starring turn. The film, released on September 2, 2016, in the UK, garnered awards attention, including a British Independent Film Award nomination for Pugh as Best Actress.

By 2018, Pugh expanded into diverse genres and higher-profile projects, beginning with a supporting role as Eva in the horror film *Malevolent*, a Netflix production about siblings faking hauntings that encounters real supernatural forces. She then appeared as Elizabeth de Burgh in *Outlaw King*, a Netflix historical drama directed by David Mackenzie, depicting Robert the Bruce's Scottish rebellion, released on November 9, 2018. In television, Pugh played Cordelia in the BBC's *King Lear* adaptation, broadcast on May 28, 2018, opposite Anthony Hopkins as the titular monarch. She also portrayed Charmaine in the AMC/BBC miniseries *The Little Drummer Girl*, a six-episode espionage thriller based on John le Carré's novel, airing from November 2018, which required her to adopt an American accent and undergo dialect coaching. Her breakout mainstream role came as Saraya "Paige" Knight in *Fighting with My Family*, a WWE Studios comedy-drama directed by Stephen Merchant about wrestler Paige's rise, released on February 14, 2019, but filmed in 2017; Pugh underwent wrestling training for three months, performing stunts herself and receiving praise for capturing the real-life athlete's grit. These roles demonstrated her versatility across indie films, horror, historical epics, and action-comedy, building momentum toward wider recognition.

### Breakthrough and acclaim (2019–2021)

Pugh's portrayal of professional wrestler Saraya "Paige" Bevis in the biographical sports comedy *Fighting with My Family*, directed by Stephen Merchant, marked her entry into wider international audiences when the film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 28, 2019, and was theatrically released in the United States on February 14, 2019. The movie, based on the true story of the Bevis wrestling family, earned a 93% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes from 242 reviews, with critics highlighting Pugh's energetic and authentic depiction of Paige's rise in WWE.

Throughout 2019, Pugh delivered two critically lauded performances in genre films that solidified her reputation for emotional intensity. In Ari Aster's folk horror *Midsommar*, released on July 3, 2019, she played Dani Ardor, a graduate student unraveling amid grief and cult rituals, receiving praise for her raw portrayal of psychological trauma; the film holds an 83% Rotten Tomatoes score, and Pugh earned a National Society of Film Critics nomination for Best Actress. Her role as the ambitious Amy March in Greta Gerwig's adaptation of *Little Women*, released December 25, 2019, further elevated her profile, with reviewers noting her mature handling of the character's evolution from child to artist; this performance led to her first Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress, announced on January 13, 2020.

In 2021, Pugh expanded into blockbuster territory with her Marvel Cinematic Universe debut as assassin Yelena Belova, Natasha Romanoff's surrogate sister, in Cate Shortland's *Black Widow*, released simultaneously in theaters and on Disney+ on July 9, 2021, after pandemic-related delays. Critics commended her sardonic humor and physicality, often citing her as a standout in the ensemble, which contributed to the film's box office success of over $379 million worldwide despite mixed reviews. This role positioned Pugh as a rising action star while maintaining her indie credibility from prior acclaim.

### Established stardom and recent projects (2022–present)

In 2022, Pugh expanded her range across genres, starring as Lib Wright, a Crimean War veteran and nurse tasked with observing a young girl's improbable fast in 19th-century Ireland, in the Netflix psychological drama *The Wonder*, directed by Sebastián Lelio and released on November 2. The film, adapted from Emma Donoghue's novel, received acclaim for Pugh's portrayal of a skeptical, haunted protagonist confronting religious fervor and communal delusion, earning an 85% approval rating from critics on Rotten Tomatoes based on 175 reviews. That September, she led *Don't Worry Darling* as Alice Chambers, a housewife unraveling in a secretive 1950s utopian community, in Olivia Wilde's thriller, which grossed $70.2 million against a $30 million budget but drew mixed reception, with Pugh's performance singled out for its emotional depth amid narrative criticisms. She also voiced the cunning outlaw Goldilocks in DreamWorks' animated *Puss in Boots: The Last Wish*, released December 21, contributing to its strong commercial performance of $485.3 million worldwide.

Pugh's 2023 output included the lead in *A Good Person*, directed by and co-starring Zach Braff, where she played Allison Gray, a former musician grappling with opioid addiction and guilt after causing a fatal car accident; the film premiered at SXSW on March 17 and received a limited theatrical release, with reviewers praising Pugh's raw depiction of recovery and familial reconciliation despite uneven scripting. Her supporting turn as Jean Tatlock, the psychiatrist, Communist activist, and intermittent lover of J. Robert Oppenheimer, in Christopher Nolan's *Oppenheimer*—released July 21—further cemented her versatility in prestige cinema; the biographical epic grossed $952.6 million globally and earned Pugh recognition in ensemble cast awards, including a 2024 win from the Hollywood Critics Association. Tatlock's historical role as an influential yet tragic figure in Oppenheimer's life was rendered with attention to her intellectual independence and personal struggles, aligning with Nolan's focus on moral ambiguities in atomic bomb development.

By 2024, Pugh assumed the role of Princess Irulan Corrino, the poised Bene Gesserit narrator and political observer, in Denis Villeneuve's *Dune: Part Two*, released March 1, which amplified her presence in blockbuster science fiction with a worldwide gross surpassing $711 million; her character provided strategic exposition on Arrakis' power dynamics, drawing from Frank Herbert's novel while expanding Irulan's subtle influence. This period marked her solidification as an A-list actress capable of bridging indie intensity with tentpole franchises, evidenced by her expanded Marvel Cinematic Universe commitments as Yelena Belova. In 2025, she reprised Yelena in the anti-hero team-up *Thunderbolts**, released earlier that year, earning a Best Actress win at the Astra Midseason Movie Awards for her commanding lead amid the ensemble's chaotic dynamics. Pugh also voiced Yelena in the animated series *Marvel Zombies*, debuting October 3 on Disney+, extending her action-oriented portfolio into voice work. These projects, alongside nominations for ensemble casts in *Dune: Part Two* (2025) and prior MCU efforts, underscore her commercial draw and critical reliability without major solo award breakthroughs post-2020.

## Public image

### Fashion choices and media presence

Florence Pugh has cultivated a reputation for bold and unconventional fashion selections, particularly on red carpets, favoring dramatic silhouettes, sheer fabrics, and vibrant colors that diverge from traditional Hollywood elegance. Her style evolution traces back to early appearances, such as the 2018 London Film Critics' Circle Awards in a Sandra Mansour embroidered dress, progressing to more avant-garde ensembles by the early 2020s. A pivotal moment occurred on July 8, 2022, at the Valentino haute couture show in Rome, where she wore a transparent mesh gown revealing her nipples, which ignited significant online debate and criticism from some commentators labeling it inappropriate. Pugh responded directly on Instagram on July 11, 2022, defending her autonomy over her body and decrying the "aggressive" and "vulgar" nature of the backlash, primarily from male detractors, while emphasizing that such scrutiny reflects broader societal discomfort with female self-expression rather than the garment itself.  

Subsequent outfits reinforced this experimental approach, including a hot pink Versace gown and a custom glitter Prada dress at various 2023-2024 events, earning praise from fashion outlets for their confidence and innovation, though occasionally drawing polarized reactions. As an ambassador for Valentino since 2021, Pugh has influenced the brand's campaigns with her preference for sculptural, bejeweled pieces, such as those worn at the 2022 Venice Film Festival, blending historical references with contemporary edge. These choices, often accessorized with signature voluminous up-dos, underscore a deliberate rejection of slimming or concealing attire, aligning with her public stance on body positivity amid industry pressures.  

In media presence, Pugh maintains a robust Instagram account with over 10 million followers as of 2025, where she shares unpolished, authentic content including behind-the-scenes glimpses, cooking videos, and direct engagements with fans, contrasting the curated perfection common among peers. She has committed to this "real" approach explicitly, stating in a May 5, 2025, interview her aim to demonstrate to younger audiences that social media need not feature only idealized images. Her interview style similarly emphasizes candor; for instance, in a September 2024 British Vogue feature, she discussed overcoming body-related insecurities and tuning out critics, framing her visibility as a tool for normalizing diverse female forms in entertainment. This media strategy, rooted in early YouTube uploads of personal performances, has bolstered her relatability, though it occasionally amplifies controversies tied to her fashion decisions. In December 2024, during promotion for *We Live in Time*, Pugh reiterated resistance to body shaming in press, highlighting the entertainment industry's uneven standards for women's appearances.

### Body image advocacy and public scrutiny

Pugh has encountered significant public scrutiny over her physique and attire, notably after wearing a sheer pink Valentino gown to the brand's haute couture show in Rome on July 8, 2022, which revealed her nipples and prompted online comments deriding her visible midriff fat and curves as unflattering.  The backlash, largely from male commenters fixated on her weight rather than the garment, escalated to thousands of Instagram replies labeling her body "disgusting" or unsuitable for high fashion. In direct response, Pugh posted a lengthy Instagram statement on July 12, 2022, condemning the "degrading" remarks as rooted in misogyny and insecurity, asserting that such criticism reflects critics' issues more than hers, and declaring, "Grow up. Respect people." 

Earlier in her career, Pugh reported facing professional pressure to conform to slimmer ideals; at age 19 during an audition, studio executives criticized her body and proposed reshaping her jawline via cosmetic intervention, prompting her to briefly view acting as a "massive mistake." She has since rejected such demands, stating in a January 2023 interview that she refuses to lose weight for roles, prioritizing health and pleasure in eating over industry aesthetics, as evidenced by her unapologetic embrace of pasta and bread despite awareness of Hollywood's thinness bias. This stance aligns with her broader resistance to dieting, which she attributes to avoiding the metabolic disruptions she observed in peers.

In advocacy efforts, Pugh has publicly championed visibility of natural body features like cellulite and curves, arguing in an August 2023 Elle UK interview with Jodie Turner-Smith that concealing them perpetuates unrealistic standards, and affirming, "I'm fully aware of my breast size and am not scared of it."  She has described blocking "nasty" online detractors as essential for mental preservation, noting in September 2024 that repeated weight-based attacks remain painful but no longer undermine her confidence.  By December 2024, Pugh reiterated her refusal to navigate "fine lines" of industry expectations for women, labeling body scrutiny as a tool to deem them "problematic" if assertive.  Her positions draw from personal experience rather than abstract ideology, emphasizing causal links between suppressed natural variance and broader health harms in entertainment.

## Personal life

### Romantic relationships

Pugh began a romantic relationship with American actor and director Zach Braff in early 2019, after they connected via direct messages on Instagram and collaborated on his short film *In the Time It Takes to Get There*, which he wrote specifically for her. Braff, born in 1975, is 21 years older than Pugh, born in 1996. The couple kept their relationship largely private initially but faced significant public scrutiny and online harassment over the age disparity, which Pugh later described as turning "nasty" due to trolls despite their efforts to shield it. They separated amicably in early 2022 after three years together, with Pugh confirming the split in a September 2022 interview and both parties maintaining a positive rapport thereafter.

In May 2022, shortly after her breakup with Braff, Pugh was rumored to be dating British actor Will Poulter, fueled by their joint appearance at the *Garden State* 20th anniversary screening, but she publicly denied any romantic involvement. Later that December, she was photographed with photographer Charlie Gooch following the British Fashion Awards, sparking dating speculation that continued into 2023 with multiple public sightings together. No official confirmation of a relationship with Gooch emerged, and reports of their association faded by mid-2023.

Pugh confirmed in a September 2024 interview that she had entered a new relationship, describing it as one they were "figuring out" while expressing intentions to start a family in the future, though she withheld her partner's identity. Subsequent reports from early 2024 onward have linked her romantically to British actor Finn Cole, known for *Peaky Blinders*, citing discreet sightings, flirty social media interactions, and joint public appearances, including red carpet events. The pair, both aged 29, reportedly began dating in late 2023 or early 2024 and have kept details private, with unconfirmed tabloid claims of an engagement surfacing in August 2025. As of October 2025, no breakup has been reported, aligning with Pugh's emphasis on privacy in her personal life.

### Health and family planning disclosures

Pugh disclosed in November 2024 that she was diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and endometriosis at age 27, following an egg count test conducted by gynecologist Thaïs Aliabadi. The diagnoses surprised her, given her family's history of high fertility, including her mother bearing children into her forties and her grandmother throughout much of her life. Prior to the diagnoses, Pugh reported experiencing medical gaslighting from doctors who dismissed her symptoms.

Both PCOS and endometriosis are chronic conditions known to potentially reduce fertility by affecting ovulation and egg quality or causing pelvic adhesions that impair implantation. Aliabadi recommended egg freezing to mitigate these risks and preserve Pugh's options for future childbearing, a procedure Pugh described as "tiring and horrible" but necessary for regaining control over her reproductive future. She underwent the process in 2023, emphasizing in interviews the importance of early reproductive health checks for women, regardless of family history.

Pugh has not publicly detailed other family planning decisions, such as timelines for parenthood or use of contraception, but her disclosures highlight proactive measures against infertility linked to her conditions. She advocates for greater awareness of PCOS and endometriosis symptoms to avoid delayed diagnoses that could limit reproductive choices.

## Controversies

### Age-gap relationship criticisms

Florence Pugh's relationship with actor and director Zach Braff, which began in early 2019 and ended in 2022, drew significant public scrutiny primarily due to their 21-year age difference; Pugh was 23 when they started dating, while Braff was 44. The couple, who kept much of their romance private initially, faced online backlash from fans and social media users who questioned the dynamics of the pairing, often highlighting perceived power imbalances and maturity gaps inherent in large age disparities between romantic partners.

Critics on platforms like Instagram and Twitter accused Braff of leveraging his established career for influence over the rising star, with some labeling the relationship as predatory despite both parties being consenting adults. Pugh addressed the vitriol directly in April 2020 via an Instagram post, stating, "I do not need you to tell me who I should and should not be with," and emphasizing her autonomy at age 24: "There's a reason why I'm not with someone my age—it hasn't worked." The backlash intensified after Braff's short film *In the Time It Takes to Get There*, featuring Pugh, premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2020, prompting further speculation about professional overlaps fueling personal criticism.

In a September 2024 *British Vogue* interview, Pugh reflected that the relationship remained "private until it was nasty," noting that public defense became necessary amid "mean" and persistent trolling, which she said strained their dynamic and contributed to prolonged media attention. Braff echoed similar sentiments in joint interviews, describing the scrutiny as an "ambush" from the outset, though he acknowledged the age gap as a focal point for detractors regardless of mutual compatibility. While some commentary framed the criticism as protective concern for younger women in Hollywood, Pugh maintained that such judgments overlooked individual agency and her deliberate choices in partnerships. No formal complaints or legal issues arose from the relationship, and post-breakup analyses in entertainment media have largely attributed the split to logistical challenges like distance rather than age-related factors.

### On-set and professional disputes

During the production of *Don't Worry Darling* (2022), directed by Olivia Wilde, rumors emerged of tension between Pugh and Wilde, including a reported "screaming match" in January 2021 over Pugh's frustration with Wilde's directing approach and alleged frequent absences from the set.  These claims, initially detailed in a Vulture report citing anonymous sources, suggested Pugh felt the film was veering off course artistically. However, multiple crew members and studio executives publicly disputed the account, stating that no such blowout occurred and describing the set as professionally run without notable drama between the leads. 

Compounding speculation, Pugh's limited participation in the film's promotional events—such as skipping the Venice Film Festival premiere in September 2022—was attributed by her representatives to scheduling conflicts with *Dune: Part Two* reshoots, though tabloid reports linked it to interpersonal friction. Pugh addressed the matter sparingly, stating in a September 2022 *Vogue* interview that she prioritizes handling professional crises privately to avoid amplifying media narratives that pit women against each other. Wilde, for her part, dismissed feud rumors as manufactured by a sensationalist press in an October 2022 *Deadline* podcast appearance, emphasizing collaborative success over unverified gossip.

A related point of contention involved the recasting of the male lead from Shia LaBeouf to Harry Styles in 2020, with Wilde claiming the change protected Pugh's "process," while LaBeouf later contested this narrative in a *Variety* interview, asserting he departed voluntarily due to scheduling. Pugh publicly praised LaBeouf's professionalism in an August 2022 *Variety* Actors on Actors conversation, crediting him with elevating her performance, which fueled further speculation of discord with Wilde's decisions. Neither Pugh nor Wilde confirmed ongoing issues, and Pugh reiterated in a May 2023 *Vanity Fair* interview her experience on "chaotic" sets generally, without naming *Don't Worry Darling* specifically, noting she focuses on controllable elements like her own work amid production challenges.

No other verified on-set or professional disputes involving Pugh have been substantiated in reporting up to 2025, with crew and collaborators from projects like *Oppenheimer* (2023) and *Midsommar* (2019) describing her as collaborative and professional.

## Artistic output

### Film roles

Pugh began her film career with a supporting role as Abbie Mortimer in the 2014 British drama *The Falling*, directed by Carol Morley, which explores themes of hysteria among schoolgirls in 1960s England.

Her breakthrough came in 2016 with the lead role of Katherine in *Lady Macbeth*, a loose adaptation of Nikolai Leskov's novella *Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District*, directed by William Oldroyd. In the film, set in rural 19th-century England, Pugh portrayed a restless young bride confined to a loveless marriage with an impotent coal mine heir, whose affair with a stable hand escalates into deception and murder to protect her autonomy. Critics praised her performance for its intensity and emotional range, earning an 89% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, where reviewers highlighted her as a "mesmerizing" force driving the film's unforgiving narrative.

Pugh's profile rose further in 2018 with supporting roles, including Elizabeth de Burgh, wife to Robert the Bruce, in the historical epic *Outlaw King* directed by David Mackenzie, and the lead in the horror thriller *Malevolent* as Angela, a woman confronting supernatural entities tied to her past.

The year 2019 marked her international breakthrough with three diverse lead roles. In *Fighting with My Family*, a biographical comedy-drama directed by Stephen Merchant, she played Saraya "Paige" Knight, the real-life WWE wrestler from a dysfunctional family of performers, capturing the character's physicality and resilience during her rise in professional wrestling. She then starred as Dani Ardor in Ari Aster's folk horror *Midsommar*, depicting a psychology student grappling with family trauma who travels to a remote Swedish commune, where rituals expose her vulnerability and lead to psychological unraveling; Pugh's raw portrayal of grief and catharsis, including extended sequences of wailing, drew acclaim for its visceral authenticity. Finally, in Greta Gerwig's adaptation of *Little Women*, Pugh embodied Amy March, the youngest sister evolving from a vain artist to a principled wife, earning nominations for the Academy Award and BAFTA for Best Supporting Actress for her nuanced interpretation of the character's maturation. These performances collectively showcased her versatility across genres, contributing to *Little Women*'s 95% Rotten Tomatoes score.

In 2021, Pugh entered the Marvel Cinematic Universe as Yelena Belova, the assassin sister of Natasha Romanoff, in *Black Widow* directed by Cate Shortland, where her sardonic humor and combat skills provided comic relief amid the film's espionage and family reconciliation plot. She reprised the role in the 2025 film *Thunderbolts**. Subsequent roles included Alice Chambers in Olivia Wilde's psychological thriller *Don't Worry Darling* (2022), a housewife in a secretive utopian community questioning her reality, and the titular Elizabeth "Lib" Wright in Sebastián Lelio's *The Wonder* (2022), a nurse investigating a girl's miraculous fast in 1860s Ireland.

Pugh portrayed Frankie Brooks, a recovering addict and music manager, in the 2023 drama *A Good Person* written and directed by Zachary Braff. That year, she also played Jean Tatlock, the psychiatrist and brief lover of J. Robert Oppenheimer, in Christopher Nolan's biographical thriller *Oppenheimer*, delivering a performance noted for its emotional depth in the ensemble-driven depiction of the atomic bomb's development. In 2024, she appeared as Princess Irulan in Denis Villeneuve's *Dune: Part Two*, the imperial heir providing strategic narration and political insight in the sci-fi epic's interstellar conflict.

### Television and other media

Pugh debuted on television in 2016 with a recurring role as Cara Thomas, the daughter of the protagonist detective, in the first season of the ITV crime drama *Marcella*. Her performance featured in three episodes, marking an early supporting turn in a series centered on a former detective investigating cold cases.

In 2018, Pugh took a lead role as Charlie Ross, a young British actress drawn into espionage, in the six-episode AMC/BBC miniseries *The Little Drummer Girl*, adapted from John le Carré's novel about intelligence operations during the 1970s Arab-Israeli conflict. That year, she also portrayed Cordelia, the loyal youngest daughter, in Richard Eyre's BBC/Amazon television adaptation of Shakespeare's *King Lear*, starring opposite Anthony Hopkins as the aging monarch whose division of his kingdom precipitates familial tragedy. The production, filmed in Yorkshire and Denmark, aired on BBC Two in May 2018 and emphasized themes of power, betrayal, and vulnerability through stark, modern staging.

Pugh expanded into American television with her portrayal of Yelena Belova, a skilled assassin and Black Widow operative, in three episodes of the 2021 Disney+ Marvel miniseries *Hawkeye*, set during Christmas in New York and focusing on Clint Barton's confrontation with past enemies. This role built on her film debut as the character in *Black Widow* (2021), contributing to the series' blend of action, humor, and character-driven narrative. In 2023, she starred as Verna, a enigmatic shape-shifting figure embodying a demonic force targeting the Usher family dynasty, in Mike Flanagan's Netflix limited series *The Fall of the House of Usher*, a loose adaptation of Edgar Allan Poe's story incorporating elements from multiple Poe works across eight episodes. Her dual performance as Verna—manifesting in various guises to orchestrate the family's downfall—drew on horror tropes and moral reckoning, with the series premiering on October 12, 2023.

Beyond live-action television, Pugh has ventured into voice acting for animated projects. She voiced the fierce, porridge-obsessed Goldilocks, leader of the Three Bears crime family, in the 2022 DreamWorks animated film *Puss in Boots: The Last Wish*, delivering a performance noted for its energetic range and distinctive roar. In 2023, she provided the English dub voice for Kiriko, a supporting character in Studio Ghibli's *The Boy and the Heron*, directed by Hayao Miyazaki, contributing to the film's exploration of grief and fantasy worlds. Upcoming work includes voicing Yelena Belova in the Marvel animated series *Marvel Zombies*, slated for Disney+ release. These roles highlight her versatility in non-visual performance, extending her presence into animation without reliance on physical portrayal.

### Music and soundtrack work

Pugh began sharing original songs and covers online during her teenage years, uploading tracks such as "Square One," "I'll Wait," and "Refound" to SoundCloud around 2011–2012. These early efforts, recorded when she was approximately 15–16 years old, featured acoustic guitar and piano arrangements with lyrics exploring personal themes, though they received limited public attention prior to her acting breakthrough.

In 2021, under the pseudonym "Flossie Rose," Pugh posted cover versions of popular songs to YouTube, including renditions that demonstrated her vocal range but were not positioned as professional releases. These informal videos aligned with her pre-fame musical interests rather than structured soundtrack contributions.

Her most notable music work occurred in 2023 with the soundtrack for the film *A Good Person*, directed by Zach Braff, in which she starred as Allison Dorsey. Pugh wrote and performed two original songs for the character's storyline: the ambient ballad "The Best Part," reflecting emotional vulnerability, and the piano-driven "I Hate Myself," addressing self-doubt and recovery from trauma.  The tracks were released as part of the compilation *Allison's Songs* on March 24, 2023, via Universal Music Group, marking her debut as a credited singer-songwriter. Pugh described composing them to embody her character's mindset during a period of grief and addiction, integrating them into the film's narrative to enhance thematic depth.

Beyond original compositions, Pugh has appeared in music videos, including starring in Yungblud's "Zombie" in October 2025, a track dedicated to nurses amid healthcare themes, though her role was performative rather than musical. She has not released standalone music albums or pursued a dedicated recording career, with her contributions remaining tied to film projects.

## Accolades

### Major awards and nominations

Pugh's most prominent recognition came with a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role for her portrayal of Amy March in *Little Women* (2019), announced on January 7, 2020, for the 92nd Academy Awards ceremony. This marked her sole Academy Award nomination to date.

She received parallel acclaim from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA), earning a nomination for Best Actress in a Supporting Role for *Little Women* at the 73rd BAFTA Awards in 2020. Pugh had previously been nominated for the BAFTA EE Rising Star Award in 2018, recognizing her emerging talent across films like *Lady Macbeth* (2016) and *Fighting with My Family* (2019). Additionally, she garnered a BAFTA Scotland nomination for Best Actress in a Film for *Fighting with My Family* in 2019.
