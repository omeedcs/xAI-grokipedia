  "content": "# Justin Bieber\n\nJustin Drew Bieber (born March 1, 1994) is a Canadian singer-songwriter who rose to global prominence as a teenager after talent manager Scooter Braun discovered videos of him performing covers on YouTube in 2008. Signed to Island Def Jam Recordings and mentored by Usher, Bieber released his debut EP *My World* in 2009, followed by the album *My World 2.0*, which included the breakthrough single \"Baby\" and has been certified multi-platinum by the RIAA. His subsequent studio albums, including *Purpose* (2015) and *Justice* (2021), propelled him to over 124 million equivalent album units sold worldwide, establishing him as one of the best-selling music artists of the digital era. Bieber has received two Grammy Awards out of 23 nominations, notably for Best Dance Recording for \"Where Are Ü Now\" in 2016, alongside a Latin Grammy for his contribution to \"Despacito (Remix).\" His rapid ascent brought intense scrutiny, including a 2014 arrest in Miami Beach for driving under the influence, resisting arrest, and driving without a valid license following an incident of street racing. In his personal life, Bieber married model Hailey Bieber (née Baldwin) in a New York City courthouse ceremony on September 13, 2018, with the couple welcoming their son, Jack Blues Bieber, in August 2024.\n\n## Early life\n\n### Upbringing and family influences\n\nJustin Bieber was born on March 1, 1994, at St. Joseph's Hospital in London, Ontario, Canada, to unmarried teenage parents Pattie Mallette and Jeremy Jack Bieber, both aged 18. Mallette became pregnant at 17 following a tumultuous on-and-off relationship with Bieber's father that began when she was 15; she later detailed facing pressure from family and others to abort but opted against it after attending a crisis pregnancy center and drawing on her emerging Christian faith. The couple separated months after Bieber's birth, leaving Mallette to raise him as a single mother in Stratford, Ontario, where they lived in subsidized low-income housing while she worked various low-paying office jobs.\n\nMallette's Christian beliefs profoundly shaped Bieber's early environment; she credited prayer and youth group involvement for her resilience during pregnancy and emphasized faith in her 2012 memoir *Nowhere But Up*, which recounts overcoming drug issues and relational instability post-high school dropout to prioritize motherhood. Bieber has described his mother's sacrifices, including forgoing further education and stable partnerships, as foundational to his work ethic, noting in interviews her role in fostering his musical interests from age four by providing a drum kit and enrolling him in lessons for piano, guitar, and trumpet. This modest, faith-oriented household contrasted with the absenteeism of his father, who maintained sporadic contact during Bieber's childhood amid personal struggles including substance issues and multiple subsequent relationships that produced half-siblings Jaxon (born 2009), Jazmyn (born 2008), and others.\n\nJeremy Bieber's limited early involvement—characterized by sources as intermittent and strained—did not provide consistent paternal guidance, though he later reconnected more steadily after Bieber's fame emerged around 2008, co-authoring a 2016 book on fatherhood. Mallette's family, including grandparents who assisted with childcare, offered supplementary support, but the core dynamic of a resilient single-parent home amid financial hardship instilled in Bieber an early independence, evidenced by his self-taught skating and hockey participation in Stratford's community programs by age five. This upbringing, marked by evangelical influences and economic constraints rather than privilege, has been cited by Bieber himself as fueling his drive, though it also exposed him to relational instability mirrored in his parents' unresolved co-parenting tensions.\n\n### Initial musical pursuits and YouTube discovery\n\nBieber exhibited musical talent from a young age, teaching himself to play multiple instruments including the drums, guitar, piano, and trumpet without formal instruction. He performed locally in Stratford, Ontario, including at church events and street busking sessions, honing his skills through self-directed practice.\n\nIn early 2007, at the age of 12, Bieber entered a local singing competition in Stratford, where he performed Ne-Yo's \"So Sick\" and secured second place. His mother, Pattie Mallette, subsequently uploaded videos of this performance and other cover songs to YouTube in 2007, initially intending them for family and distant relatives to view. These homemade clips featured Bieber singing popular tracks such as Edwin McCain's \"I'll Be,\" Chris Brown's \"With You,\" and Justin Timberlake's \"Cry Me a River,\" often accompanied by his self-taught guitar or piano playing, and quickly amassed views beyond the intended audience.\n\nThe YouTube videos attracted the attention of American talent manager Scooter Braun in 2008, who discovered Bieber's content while browsing the platform and recognized his vocal and performative potential despite his youth. Braun contacted Mallette directly, leading to an audition opportunity in Atlanta, Georgia, that marked the transition from amateur uploads to professional development. This serendipitous online exposure exemplified the platform's role in democratizing talent scouting at the time, bypassing traditional industry gatekeepers.\n\n## Career\n\n### 2007–2009: Discovery, debut, and My World EP\n\nIn 2007, 13-year-old Justin Bieber from Stratford, Ontario, began uploading videos to YouTube featuring covers of songs by artists such as Ne-Yo and Stevie Wonder, initially intended for friends and family but gaining wider attention. Music executive Scooter Braun discovered Bieber's videos while searching for another artist on the platform and contacted Bieber's mother, Pattie Mallette, to arrange an audition in Atlanta. There, Bieber impressed Braun and received mentorship from R\\u0026B singer Usher, leading to his signing with Raymond Braun Media Group (RBMG), a joint venture between Braun and Usher, in mid-2008.\n\nFollowing the RBMG deal, Bieber secured a recording contract with Island Def Jam Records in October 2008 through L.A. Reid, forming a joint venture with RBMG that enabled professional production. Bieber relocated temporarily to Atlanta to work with producers including Tricky Stewart and The-Dream, focusing on teen pop material emphasizing young romance and accessibility.\n\nBieber's debut single, \"One Time,\" a pop track about infatuation produced by Tricky Stewart, premiered on mainstream radio on May 18, 2009. The song was released digitally in Canada on July 7, 2009, followed by the U.S. on the same date, marking Bieber's entry into commercial music with its simple, hook-driven structure aimed at adolescent audiences.\n\nThe My World extended play (EP), Bieber's debut release, came out on November 17, 2009, via Island Records, comprising seven tracks including \"One Time,\" \"Favorite Girl,\" \"Down to Earth,\" \"Bigger,\" and \"One Less Lonely Girl,\" with Bieber co-writing several and drawing from R\\u0026B and pop influences. The EP's packaging and promotion positioned Bieber as a fresh teen idol, with its lead single's radio play driving initial sales exceeding 137,000 units in its U.S. debut week.\n\n### 2010–2011: Global breakthrough with My World 2.0, Never Say Never, and Under the Mistletoe\n\n*My World 2.0*, Bieber's first full-length studio album, was released on March 19, 2010, serving as the second installment following his debut EP *My World*. The record debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, moving 283,000 copies in its opening week and marking Bieber, at age 16, as the youngest solo male artist to top the chart since Stevie Wonder in 1963. It achieved platinum certification in the United States within two months and contributed to combined *My Worlds* sales exceeding 5 million units across 27 countries. Singles such as \"Eenie Meenie\" featuring Sean Kingston and \"Somebody to Love\" extended Bieber's chart momentum, with the album's promotion including the My World Tour, which ran from June 2010 to November 2011 and grossed over $53 million worldwide.\n\nIn February 2011, the concert film *Justin Bieber: Never Say Never* premiered, documenting Bieber's rise and performances from his My World Tour. Directed by Jon M. Chu, it opened to $29.5 million domestically—the highest-grossing concert film debut at the time—and ultimately earned $73 million in North America on a $13 million budget. The film's success amplified Bieber's global visibility, coinciding with Grammy nominations for Best New Artist and Best Pop Vocal Album for *My World 2.0*.\n\nBieber closed the period with his holiday album *Under the Mistletoe*, released November 1, 2011. It debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 with 210,000 first-week sales, becoming the first Christmas album by a male artist to achieve this milestone. Featuring covers like \"Drummer Boy\" with Busta Rhymes and originals such as the lead single \"Mistletoe,\" the project sold over 2.7 million copies internationally, solidifying Bieber's commercial dominance amid his teen pop breakthrough.\n\n### 2012–2014: Believe, Journals, and transitional projects\n\nBieber released his third studio album, *Believe*, on June 15, 2012, marking an intentional shift toward a more mature sound incorporating elements of EDM, pop, and R\\u0026B to distance from his earlier teen pop image. The album featured collaborations with artists such as Big Sean on \"As Long as You Love Me\" and Nicki Minaj on \"Beauty and a Beat,\" both of which became prominent singles alongside the lead track \"Boyfriend,\" which debuted at number one on the Billboard Dance/Electronic Songs chart. *Believe* debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, selling 374,000 copies in its first week, securing Bieber's fourth consecutive chart-topping album in the United States, though this figure represented a decline from the 521,000 first-week sales of his prior holiday album *Under the Mistletoe*. Globally, the album achieved sales exceeding 4 million copies across 19 countries, topping charts in multiple territories including Canada and Australia.\n\nTo promote *Believe*, Bieber embarked on the Believe Tour, commencing on September 29, 2012, at the Jobing.com Arena in Glendale, Arizona, and extending through December 8, 2013, encompassing 155 shows across six continents. The tour grossed over $210 million from more than 2.4 million tickets sold, featuring high-energy performances with aerial stunts, pyrotechnics, and guest appearances, though it faced occasional disruptions from Bieber's health issues and logistical challenges. Additional North American dates were added in late 2012, expanding the itinerary to include major venues like Madison Square Garden in New York and the Staples Center in Los Angeles.\n\nIn December 2013, Bieber released *Journals*, a digital compilation album on December 23 consisting of 15 previously unreleased tracks presented as acoustic and R\\u0026B-leaning recordings, intended as a personal outlet amid label disputes over its classification as a non-traditional album. The project, which included singles like \"Heartbreaker\" and \"Confident,\" emphasized introspective themes of relationships and growth but received limited physical distribution and promotional support from Island Records, resulting in modest commercial impact without a Billboard 200 debut in the top tier. This release underscored Bieber's transitional phase, experimenting with a more adult-oriented, less polished aesthetic as he navigated creative control tensions and the onset of public personal controversies, including legal issues beginning in 2013 that overshadowed artistic endeavors.\n\n### 2015–2016: Purpose and mainstream resurgence\n\nFollowing a period of personal controversies and a creative hiatus, Justin Bieber released his fourth studio album, *Purpose*, on November 13, 2015. The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart, selling 522,000 pure copies and moving 649,000 equivalent album units in its first week, marking Bieber's largest sales week to date. *Purpose* featured a shift toward mature themes of redemption, love, and self-reflection, incorporating EDM, tropical house, and R\\u0026B elements, which contrasted with his earlier teen pop sound. Critically, the album received generally positive reviews, with outlets praising Bieber's vocal growth and production quality from collaborators like Skrillex, Diplo, and Benny Blanco, though some noted its formulaic pop structure.\n\nThe lead single \"What Do You Mean?\" was released on August 28, 2015, topping the Billboard Hot 100 for two non-consecutive weeks and becoming Bieber's first number-one hit as a lead artist in the U.S. \"Sorry,\" released October 23, 2015, followed suit, reaching number one for three weeks and achieving diamond certification in multiple countries due to its streaming success. \"Love Yourself,\" issued November 5, 2015, also hit number one on the Hot 100 for two weeks, making Bieber the first artist to occupy the top three positions on the UK Singles Chart simultaneously with these tracks in January 2016. These singles amassed billions of streams, driving *Purpose* to over 20 million equivalent album sales globally by emphasizing Bieber's transition to a more introspective and electronically influenced style.\n\nIn 2016, Bieber launched the Purpose World Tour on May 5, supporting the album with 141 shows across five continents, grossing $257 million and attracting 2.8 million attendees, ranking among the highest-grossing tours of the year. The tour's success, coupled with album sales exceeding 6 million worldwide in its debut year, underscored Bieber's mainstream resurgence, as he swept awards including four American Music Awards in 2016 for Artist of the Year and Favorite Pop/Rock Album. This era repositioned Bieber from a tabloid fixture to a commercially dominant pop artist, with *Purpose* earning his first Grammy nomination for Best Pop Vocal Album in 2017.\n\n### 2017–2019: Collaborations and stylistic shifts\n\nIn the period following the Purpose era, Bieber focused on selective collaborations rather than a full-length solo project, allowing for genre experimentation amid personal recovery from exhaustion and health issues. This phase marked a departure from the high-output cycle of albums and tours, with Bieber releasing standalone tracks and features that showcased versatility across pop, hip-hop, EDM, and Latin influences.\n\nEarly in 2017, Bieber collaborated with producer BloodPop on \"Friends,\" a breakup anthem blending synth-pop and emotional introspection, released on February 16 as a follow-up to their prior work on Purpose. The track peaked at number 14 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and emphasized a more vulnerable lyrical style compared to his earlier upbeat hits. Later that year, on April 28, he featured on DJ Khaled's \"I'm the One\" alongside Quavo, Chance the Rapper, and Lil Wayne, a hip-hop-infused party track that debuted at number one on the Hot 100, highlighting Bieber's adaptability to rap-heavy ensembles.\n\nBieber's contributions extended to EDM with David Guetta's \"2U\" on June 9, 2017, a motivational dance track that reached number seven on the UK Singles Chart, and the \"Despacito\" remix with Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee on April 17, which fused reggaeton rhythms with English verses, propelling it to global dominance as the longest-running number-one single in Hot 100 history at 16 non-consecutive weeks. These releases demonstrated a stylistic broadening beyond pure pop, incorporating tropical and electronic elements while maintaining commercial appeal. In June 2017, Bieber independently released the inspirational single \"Life Is Worth Living,\" featuring gospel undertones reflective of his growing faith, signaling an emerging personal thematic shift.\n\nBy 2018, collaborations continued with \"No Brainer\" on August 23, another DJ Khaled track with Chance the Rapper and Quavo, which debuted at number five on the Hot 100 and reinforced Bieber's role in hip-hop crossover hits. This output contrasted with a reduced solo presence, as Bieber prioritized personal milestones including his September 2018 marriage to Hailey Bieber, influencing a pivot toward introspective content.\n\nEntering 2019, the April 12 release of \"I Don't Care\" with Ed Sheeran topped charts in 18 countries, blending pop-rock with relational themes that previewed the R\\u0026B-leaning sound of his forthcoming Changes album, characterized by trap beats, electro-R\\u0026B production, and mature reflections on commitment and vulnerability—a evolution from Purpose's dance-pop dominance to more subdued, relationship-focused introspection. This transitional phase underscored Bieber's genre-hopping proficiency, with features spanning disparate styles like Latin fusion and hip-hop, while laying groundwork for a faith-infused, less frenetic musical identity.\n\n### 2020–2022: Changes, Justice, and health-induced hiatus\n\nBieber released his fifth studio album, *Changes*, on February 14, 2020, marking his return after a period of recovery from health issues including Lyme disease and chronic mononucleosis, which he detailed in the accompanying YouTube documentary *Justin Bieber: Seasons* released that year. The album, dedicated to his wife Hailey Bieber, shifted toward a mature R\\u0026B-influenced sound with collaborations including Quavo on the single \"Intentions\" and dominant male perspectives on relationships. Lead single \"Yummy,\" released January 2020, peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100, while Bieber performed tracks on *Saturday Night Live* on February 8, 2020, his first appearance in seven years. *Changes* debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 with 231,000 album-equivalent units, including 126,000 pure sales, securing Bieber's seventh consecutive chart-topping album; it also reached number one in Canada and the UK.\n\nIn May 2020, Bieber collaborated with Ariana Grande on \"Stuck with U,\" a charity single for the Beatles' *All Together Now* campaign supporting COVID-19 relief, which debuted at number one on the Billboard Hot 100. His sixth studio album, *Justice*, followed on March 19, 2021, framed as a means to provide comfort amid global hardships, with thematic elements addressing mental health and justice. Supported by singles including \"Anyone\" (peaking at number six on the Hot 100 in January 2021), \"Holy\" featuring Chance the Rapper (number 11), and \"Peaches\" featuring Daniel Caesar and Giveon (number one for one week), the album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 with 154,000 equivalent units in its first full week, marking Bieber's eighth chart-topper. Additional singles \"Hold On\" and \"Ghost\" both reached the Hot 100 top 20, contributing to *Justice*'s commercial success, including multiple weeks at number one.\n\nThe *Justice World Tour* commenced on February 18, 2022, in Tucson, Arizona, but Bieber's recurring health struggles intensified. On June 10, 2022, he disclosed a diagnosis of Ramsay Hunt syndrome, a neurological disorder caused by the varicella-zoster virus reactivating and leading to facial nerve inflammation, resulting in partial facial paralysis on the right side. This prompted postponement of tour dates, with Bieber sharing updates via Instagram videos showing recovery progress but emphasizing rest needs. By September 6, 2022, he canceled the remaining North American dates, citing exhaustion and the priority of long-term health over short-term performance, effectively entering a hiatus from touring and major releases. These issues built on prior conditions like Lyme disease, diagnosed in 2020 after years of symptoms including fatigue and joint pain, which had previously forced tour cancellations in 2017.\n\n### 2023–2025: Return with Swag, comeback announcements, and future plans\n\nIn 2023, Bieber extended his hiatus from live performances and new music releases following complications from Ramsay Hunt syndrome, which had prompted the cancellation of the remaining dates of his Justice World Tour originally scheduled through March 2023. No original studio material was issued that year, though Bieber shared occasional social media updates on his recovery and family life.\n\nThe following year, 2024, marked personal milestones for Bieber, including the May announcement of his wife Hailey Bieber's pregnancy and the August birth of their son, Jack Blues Bieber. These events shifted public focus toward his role as a father, with Bieber posting family-oriented content online amid speculation about his career trajectory. No new music emerged, but industry reports later indicated preparations for a return driven partly by financial considerations after a multi-year absence from major projects.\n\nBieber's musical comeback materialized in 2025 with the surprise release of his seventh studio album, *Swag* (stylized in all caps), on July 11 via Def Jam Recordings and ILH Productions—his first full-length project since *Justice* in 2021. The 20-track album featured collaborations with artists including Gunna, Sexyy Red, Dijon, Mk.gee, Cash Cobain, and Lil B, embracing an experimental sound described by critics as a \"DGAF declaration\" blending pop with hip-hop and alternative influences. Themes addressed marriage, fatherhood, and personal reflection, with Bieber announcing the project via Instagram just days prior. The release debuted strongly on charts and later re-entered the Billboard top 10 following a deluxe edition.\n\nBuilding momentum, Bieber followed with *Swag II* on September 5, a 23-track sequel surprise-dropped after the original's viral success, which outlets characterized as elevating the project's coherence and pop accessibility. This sequel was positioned as a refined extension, potentially signaling a pivot toward pure pop for upcoming endeavors.\n\nLooking ahead, Bieber announced plans to headline Coachella 2026, with the event already sold out, and teased daily vlogs to document preparations, hinting at a broader return to touring. Rumors circulated of a 2026 world tour supporting a new pop album, alongside potential global performances to reconnect with fans post-hiatus. These developments followed reports of ongoing music production, though Bieber emphasized balancing family priorities.\n\n## Artistry\n\n### Influences and collaborations\n\nJustin Bieber has identified Michael Jackson as his foremost musical influence, expressing a desire to mirror the trajectory of Jackson's career from child prodigy to global icon. In a 2011 interview, Bieber emphasized that musical appreciation disregards racial categories, highlighting admiration for black artists such as Michael Jackson and Boyz II Men. Additional inspirations include R\\u0026B and hip-hop elements, with Bieber drawing from artists like 2Pac for confessional lyricism and Boyz II Men for harmonic structures, as curated in thematic playlists reflecting his formative listening.\n\nBieber's early mentorship under Usher further shaped his style, incorporating Usher's R\\u0026B sensibilities and performance techniques. This influence manifested in Bieber's vocal delivery and stage presence, blending pop accessibility with rhythmic precision derived from Usher's catalog.\n\nBieber's discography includes over 20 notable collaborations across genres, often bridging pop with hip-hop, R\\u0026B, and electronic dance music. Early hits featured rapper Ludacris on \"Baby\" from *My World 2.0* (2010), which peaked at number five on the Billboard Hot 100, and Usher on the \"Somebody to Love (Remix)\" (2010). His 2015 resurgence involved producers Skrillex and Diplo on \"Where Are Ü Now,\" earning a Grammy for Best Dance Recording in 2016 and introducing tropical house elements to his sound.\n\nSubsequent partnerships expanded globally, including the \"Despacito (Remix)\" with Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee (2017), which held the Billboard Hot 100 summit for 16 weeks and amassed over eight billion YouTube views. Hip-hop features encompassed DJ Khaled's \"I'm the One\" with Quavo, Chance the Rapper, and Lil Wayne (2017), and R\\u0026B tracks like those with SZA and Nas. Bieber also collaborated with David Guetta on \"2U\" (2017) and BloodPop on \"Friends\" (2017), both emphasizing electronic pop fusion. These efforts demonstrate Bieber's adaptability, leveraging collaborators to evolve from teen pop toward mature, genre-blending productions.\n\n### Musical style and genre evolution\n\nBieber's early music, beginning with the 2009 EP *My World*, centered on teen pop and dance-pop, characterized by upbeat tempos, catchy hooks, and R\\u0026B undertones influenced by his mentor Usher. These elements defined his debut singles like \"One Time,\" which blended accessible pop melodies with light R\\u0026B production.\n\nWith the 2012 album *Believe*, Bieber shifted toward a more mature sound, incorporating stronger R\\u0026B grooves and subtle dance influences while retaining pop structures, as evident in tracks exploring themes of growth and relationships. The accompanying *Journals* release in 2013 further emphasized R\\u0026B, focusing on introspective heartbreak narratives with minimal electronic elements.\n\nThe 2015 album *Purpose* represented a pivotal evolution, integrating tropical house, EDM, and trap beats through collaborations with producers like Skrillex and Diplo, as in the Grammy-winning \"Where Are Ü Now,\" which fused Bieber's vocal style with electronic drops. This period marked a departure from pure pop toward genre-blending experimentation, yielding hits like \"Sorry\" that combined dance rhythms with R\\u0026B sensibilities.\n\nSubsequent releases like *Changes* in 2020 leaned into electro-R\\u0026B and trap, prioritizing smoother, relationship-focused tracks over high-energy dance. *Justice* (2021) pivoted back toward pop with R\\u0026B inflections and electronic accents, aiming for uplifting anthems amid personal reflection, though critics noted its lighter production compared to the denser R\\u0026B of *Changes*. By 2025's *Swag*, Bieber revisited deeper R\\u0026B roots, signaling ongoing stylistic fluidity driven by collaborations and personal maturation.\n\n### Vocal abilities and performance techniques\n\nJustin Bieber possesses a vocal range spanning approximately A2 to E5 or F5, covering about two to three octaves, classified by analysts as a light-lyric baritone or tenor with a light, smoky, and warm timbre across registers. His voice demonstrates agility, enabling melismas and seamless transitions between chest voice and falsetto, contributing to his emotive phrasing in pop and R\\u0026B tracks.\n\nA hallmark of Bieber's technique is his frequent employment of falsetto, producing a breathy, high-pitched quality often used for ad-libs and hooks, as heard in songs like \"Yummy\" and \"Love Yourself.\" This approach, combined with subtle vibrato and dynamic control, allows for expressive delivery but relies on studio pitch correction tools like Melodyne to refine intonation, which he also applies in live settings for consistency. Vocal coaches note his post-pubertal adaptation, where a deepened range shifted from higher pre-teen pitches to more mature baritonal tones, necessitating transpositions in live performances of early material.\n\nIn live performances, Bieber's abilities manifest through energetic delivery and audience engagement, though critiques highlight occasional pitch inconsistencies and reliance on backing tracks or lip-syncing elements, particularly during high-movement choreography. Despite this, documented acapella and stripped-down renditions, such as during the Believe Tour (2012-2013), showcase competent belting up to C#5 and sustained notes without electronic aid, underscoring his foundational skill as an entertainer whose vocal prowess supports rather than dominates his stage presence.\n\n## Commercial success\n\n### Record sales and chart performance\n\nBieber's debut extended play, *My World* (2009), sold over 1 million copies in the United States, earning platinum certification from the RIAA, while its follow-up album *My World 2.0* (2010) debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and has sold more than 3 million copies domestically, achieving 3× platinum status. His holiday album *Under the Mistletoe* (2011) also topped the Billboard 200 upon release, moving 291,000 units in its first week and later certified platinum. *Believe* (2012) similarly debuted at number one, with over 2 million US sales and multi-platinum certification, bolstered by the single \"Boyfriend,\" which peaked at number five on the Hot 100.\n\nThe *Purpose* era (2015) marked Bieber's commercial peak, with the album debuting at number one on the Billboard 200, selling 649,000 equivalent units in its first week, and accumulating over 6 million worldwide equivalent album units to date. It spawned three Hot 100 number-one singles—\"What Do You Mean?\" (2015), \"Love Yourself\" (2015–2016), and \"Sorry\" (2015–2016)—a feat achieved by few artists from a single album, with \"Sorry\" alone certified 10× platinum in the US. Later releases like *Changes* (2020) and *Justice* (2021) both debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, with *Justice* generating 154,000 opening-week units and the collaboration \"Stay\" (with the Kid Laroi) topping the Hot 100 for seven weeks. Bieber's 2025 release *Swag* debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 with 163,000 equivalent units, predominantly from streaming.\n\nOn the Billboard Hot 100, Bieber has secured eight number-one singles as lead or featured artist, including \"Despacito (Remix)\" (2017, with Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee), \"I'm the One\" (2017, with DJ Khaled), and \"I Don't Care\" (2019, with Ed Sheeran), alongside over 30 top-ten entries, placing him among the chart's most successful solo male artists. His signature single \"Baby\" (2010, featuring Ludacris) peaked at number five but became the most downloaded song of the 2010s in the US, certified diamond (10 million units) by the RIAA despite limited radio airplay. Overall, Bieber's catalog has surpassed 124.5 million equivalent album units globally, driven by 20.7 million pure album sales and substantial streaming equivalents, with US digital singles exceeding 105 million units as of 2021.\n\n| Album | US Peak (Billboard 200) | US Certifications (RIAA) | Global Equivalent Units (est.) |\n|-------|------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| My World 2.0 (2010) | #1 | 3× Platinum | ~10 million |\n| Under the Mistletoe (2011) | #1 | Platinum | ~5 million |\n| Believe (2012) | #1 | 2× Platinum | ~8 million |\n| Purpose (2015) | #1 | 3× Platinum | ~20 million |\n| Justice (2021) | #1 | Platinum | ~10 million |\n\n### Awards and industry recognitions\n\nBieber has won two Grammy Awards from 23 nominations: Best Dance Recording for \"Where Are Ü Now\" (with Diplo and Skrillex) at the 58th ceremony in 2016, and Best Country Duo/Group Performance for \"10,000 Hours\" (with Dan + Shay) at the 63rd ceremony in 2021. He also received a Latin Grammy Award for Best Urban Fusion/Performance for the \"Despacito\" remix (with Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee) at the 18th ceremony in 2017.\n\nAt the Billboard Music Awards, Bieber has secured 26 victories, including Top Artist in 2016 and 2021, and multiple Top Hot 100 Song awards, such as for \"Despacito (Remix)\" in 2018 and \"Stay\" (with the Kid Laroi) in 2022; he was the first artist to win the latter category more than once. He received the Milestone Award in 2013, recognizing his chart dominance with over 10 billion audience impressions from 2010 to 2013. Bieber holds eight Juno Awards, primarily for international album and single of the year, and two Brit Awards for International Male Solo Artist in 2011 and 2016.\n\nIn terms of certifications, the RIAA has awarded Bieber five Diamond singles: \"Baby\" (featuring Ludacris), \"Sorry,\" \"Despacito (Remix),\" \"Love Yourself,\" and \"What Do You Mean?\" each exceeding 10 million units in the U.S. His overall discography has generated over 150 million certified units worldwide, reflecting sustained commercial impact.\n\nBieber has set multiple Guinness World Records, including most-streamed track on Spotify in 24 hours for \"What Do You Mean?\" (21.4 million streams on September 17, 2015), youngest solo male artist to debut at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 (with the same track on September 26, 2015), and youngest artist with five number-one U.S. albums before age 19. He earned eight record titles in the 2017 edition, encompassing streaming milestones and fan engagement metrics like most-viewed YouTube video in 24 hours for \"Baby\" (initially set in 2011).\n\n## Critical reception\n\n### Early criticism as teen pop and backlash\n\nJustin Bieber's breakthrough album *My World 2.0*, released on March 23, 2010, drew criticism for exemplifying the formulaic nature of teen pop, with tracks like \"Baby\" featuring heavy autotune and repetitive hooks aimed at a young audience. Reviewers described the music as bland and soulless, prioritizing commercial appeal over artistic depth, as Bieber's vocal delivery was often processed to mask technical limitations typical of the genre. Songs such as \"One Less Lonely Girl\" and \"Favorite Girl\" were seen as adhering to the teen-idol playbook, recycling themes of puppy love without innovation.\n\nThis musical critique fueled a broader backlash against Bieber as a manufactured product of digital marketing and industry grooming, rather than an organic talent, despite his YouTube origins. Critics and commentators dismissed his rapid rise—fueled by manager Scooter Braun and mentor Usher—as emblematic of shallow, overhyped pop stardom, leading to widespread ridicule from non-fans who viewed his \"Bieber fever\" phenomenon as culturally vacuous. Online communities amplified this sentiment through memes and high dislike ratios on videos like \"Baby,\" which garnered millions of views but faced derision for its perceived lack of substance.\n\nThe backlash extended to cultural resentment toward teen idols, with Bieber positioned as a symbol of ephemeral fame in the post-Jonas Brothers era, where his appeal to preteen girls alienated older demographics and music purists who favored authenticity over polished production. Public figures and media outlets contributed to the narrative by questioning his longevity in a genre with a short shelf life, predicting a swift decline akin to past boy band fads. While some reviews acknowledged the album's effective pop craftsmanship, the dominant early discourse framed Bieber's output as disposable, intensifying anti-fan campaigns and petitions that highlighted societal fatigue with teen pop dominance.\n\n### Reevaluation in later career and mixed reviews\n\nFollowing the release of his 2015 album *Purpose* on November 13, Bieber's work received reevaluation from critics who previously dismissed him as a teen pop act, praising the album's shift to electro-dance and tropical house elements alongside introspective lyrics addressing personal redemption.  The record's singles, including \"What Do You Mean?\" and \"Sorry,\" demonstrated vocal maturity and production sophistication, with reviewers noting Bieber's transition to a more serious artist through collaborations with producers like Skrillex and Diplo. This era marked a commercial and artistic peak, as *Purpose* sold over 6 million copies worldwide and topped charts in multiple countries, prompting acknowledgments of Bieber's growth beyond his early image.\n\nSubsequent albums elicited mixed responses, with *Changes* (February 14, 2020) criticized for its subdued R\\u0026B tone and perceived lack of emotional depth despite themes of marital contentment.  Pitchfork described the tracks as \"cold angles and frictionless surfaces,\" while Rolling Stone deemed it \"sweet and tender, but ultimately shallow,\" reflecting a one-note focus on domestic bliss that failed to recapture *Purpose*'s energy.  The Guardian noted its \"fitfully lovely\" quality but suggested Bieber's disinterest in chart dominance contributed to the album's muted impact, debuting at number one on the Billboard 200 yet receiving lower aggregate scores around 60/100 from critics.\n\n*Justice* (March 19, 2021) continued the mixed trajectory, blending pop with acoustic elements and themes of faith and justice, earning praise for earnestness but critique for mawkish songwriting and bland production.  Pitchfork called it \"surprisingly compelling\" for unearthing Bieber's charisma, while Rolling Stone highlighted \"abject affection\" tempered by \"misguided depth,\" assigning a 2.5/5 rating.  Variety viewed it as a \"sharp turn for the better,\" yet overall reception hovered around mixed-positive, with user and critic aggregates in the low 60s, indicating sustained commercial viability but inconsistent artistic innovation post-*Purpose*.\n\n## Cultural impact\n\n### Role in shaping digital fame and YouTube era\n\nIn late 2007, at age 13, Justin Bieber's mother, Pattie Mallette, uploaded amateur videos of him performing covers of songs by artists such as Ne-Yo, Stevie Wonder, and Chris Brown to YouTube, a platform then just two years old. These clips, featuring Bieber singing and playing drums or piano in informal settings, initially accumulated around 60,000 to 70,000 views.\n\nTalent manager Scooter Braun discovered Bieber in 2008 after randomly viewing the videos while searching for another artist, leading him to contact Mallette and arrange an audition in Atlanta. Braun subsequently mentored Bieber, securing a development deal with Usher and a recording contract with Island Records, marking one of the earliest instances of a major-label signing primarily driven by YouTube exposure rather than traditional scouting methods like talent shows or demos. Under Braun's guidance, Bieber's online views surged from tens of thousands to over 66 million by early 2009, fueling the release of his debut EP *My World* in November 2009.\n\nBieber's ascent demonstrated the disruptive potential of digital platforms in democratizing fame, proving that viral user-generated content could propel an unknown talent to global stardom without prior industry connections or broadcast exposure. This phenomenon shifted music industry practices, encouraging labels to invest in online talent discovery and social media promotion as viable alternatives to conventional pipelines. The \"Bieber Fever\" fan movement amplified through YouTube shares, comments, and early Twitter interactions, creating a feedback loop of organic virality that prefigured the influencer-driven economy.\n\nBy 2010, Bieber's YouTube channel had become a cornerstone of his brand, with covers and original content driving sustained engagement and informing his pivot to polished music videos that retained an accessible, relatable aesthetic. His success validated YouTube as a launchpad for pop careers, influencing subsequent artists like Carly Rae Jepsen and influencing platform algorithms to prioritize music content, though it also highlighted challenges like rapid fame's psychological toll on young creators. Overall, Bieber's path underscored causal links between algorithmic visibility, fan amplification, and commercial breakthroughs in the nascent digital era.\n\n### Legacy as a pop icon and influence on successors\n\nBieber's enduring status as a pop icon is evidenced by his commercial dominance, including over 150 million records sold worldwide and billions of streams, which positioned him as Spotify's most-streamed artist with 83.3 million monthly listeners as of mid-2021, a record underscoring his role in popularizing digital consumption of music. His trajectory from a 2008 YouTube covers discovery to multimillion-selling albums like *Purpose* (2015), which debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 with 649,000 copies in its first week, exemplifies a model of rapid ascent sustained by viral marketing and genre-blending releases. Billboard ranked him the eighth greatest pop star of the 21st century, citing his evolution from teen pop to mature R\\u0026B-infused hits that maintained chart relevance into the 2020s, including a pop radio No. 1 in October 2025 tying him with superstars like Rihanna.\n\nHis influence on successors manifests in the blueprint he established for social media-driven fame, enabling unsigned talents to bypass traditional labels through platforms like YouTube and Vine, as seen in the industry's shift post-2010 where viral videos supplanted radio airplay for breakthroughs. This path directly inspired \"pop boys\" emulating his clean-cut teen appeal and ballad-heavy style, including Shawn Mendes, who rose via Vine covers in 2013 and acknowledged parallels in fan-driven hype; Austin Mahone, dubbed a \"Bieber 2.0\" for his 2011 YouTube covers leading to RCA signing; and Cody Simpson, whose 2009 acoustic uploads mirrored Bieber's early strategy. Other acts like Conor Maynard and Why Don't We adopted similar youth-oriented pop formulas, leveraging Bieber's template of mentor-guided debuts—such as Scooter Braun's management model—to achieve initial streaming spikes and arena tours.\n\nBieber's legacy also lies in normalizing public personal reinvention amid scrutiny, influencing how successors like Mendes navigated from idol phases to edgier sounds without derailing careers, as his *Purpose* era redemption arc—post-2014 controversies—demonstrated resilience yielding hits like \"Sorry\" (over 3 billion YouTube views). Critics note his collabs with producers like Skrillex expanded pop's EDM integration, paving for genre-fluid acts, though his impact is tempered by debates over artistic depth versus market savvy, with some attributing his successors' viability more to algorithmic amplification than innovation. Overall, Bieber's model recalibrated pop's youth pipeline, prioritizing digital virality and rapid commercialization over gatekept development.\n\n## Public image\n\n### Evolution from teen idol to mature artist\n\nBieber's early career established him as a teen idol through bubblegum pop tracks like \"Baby\" from his 2010 debut album *My World 2.0*, which appealed primarily to young audiences and sparked \"Bieber Fever.\" By his 2012 album *Believe*, however, his public image began shifting amid reports of legal troubles, including arrests for driving under the influence in 2014 and vandalism incidents, leading to widespread media portrayal as a \"troubled\" celebrity and backlash against his immature antics.\n\nThe release of *Purpose* on November 13, 2015, represented a pivotal moment, with Bieber adopting a more introspective style influenced by electronic and R\\u0026B elements, addressing themes of regret, redemption, and personal growth in songs like \"Sorry\" and \"Love Yourself.\" The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, breaking streaming records with 205 million global streams in its first week, and collaborations with producers like Skrillex signaled a departure from teen pop toward genre-melding maturity. This shift coincided with Bieber's public apologies and a toned-down persona, transforming perceptions from irritant to relatable artist.\n\nSubsequent releases reinforced this evolution; the 2020 album *Changes* focused on marital devotion to Hailey Bieber, sobriety, and faith, presenting a confessional R\\u0026B sound that emphasized emotional healing over youthful exuberance. Bieber's image further matured into that of a family-oriented figure, with reduced touring and openness about mental health struggles, distancing him from the idol archetype while maintaining commercial viability through hits like \"Intentions.\" By 2025, this progression had solidified his status as a resilient pop figure who navigated fame's pressures via authentic reinvention rather than fleeting trends.\n\n### Media portrayals and fan dynamics\n\nMedia coverage of Justin Bieber initially emphasized his rapid ascent from a YouTube cover artist discovered in 2008 at age 13 to a global teen idol by 2010, highlighting his appeal to young audiences through hits like \"Baby.\" This portrayal shifted during his mid-teens amid escalating controversies, including altercations with paparazzi in 2012 and the emergence of videos from 2009 showing him using racially offensive language, which drew widespread condemnation and framed him as a \"troubled\" celebrity. Outlets like BBC and CNN documented incidents such as his 2014 DUI arrest in Miami, contributing to a narrative of reckless behavior exacerbated by fame's pressures, though Bieber later attributed suicidal ideation during this period to relentless scrutiny rather than inherent character flaws.\n\nDocumentaries reinforced evolving media images: the 2011 film *Justin Bieber: Never Say Never* celebrated his stardom and work ethic during his 2010 tour, grossing over $99 million at the box office. In contrast, the 2020 YouTube series *Justin Bieber: Seasons* provided an intimate view of his post-2015 recovery, addressing mental health struggles and marriage, signaling a mature pivot that tempered prior \"bad boy\" depictions. By 2021's *Justin Bieber: Our World*, coverage focused on professional resilience amid personal challenges, aligning with his transition to genre-blending releases like *Justice* in 2021.\n\nBieber's fanbase, known as Beliebers, emerged organically on YouTube before his 2009 debut album, amassing over 2 billion video views by 2010 through grassroots sharing that propelled his fame. Dynamics involved fervent online defense against media criticism, with fans prioritizing chart records and view counts, often performing informal promotion as if employed by his team. This loyalty persisted through backlash, fostering a subculture where fandom shaped identity, though early intensity included obsessive behaviors critiqued in analyses of teen fan communities. By the mid-2010s, Beliebers adapted to his stylistic evolution, supporting mature works while maintaining sold-out concert attendance, as seen in 2015 Purpose Tour crowds exceeding 2 million attendees globally.\n\n## Business ventures\n\n### Fashion and product lines\n\nIn 2011, Bieber launched his first fragrance line with Someday, a women's perfume developed by perfumer Honorine Blanc and marketed through Perfumania, featuring notes of mandarin, jasmine, and vanilla. Subsequent releases under the Justin Bieber brand included Girlfriend in 2012, with fruity and floral accords, and The Key in 2013, expanding to seven perfumes by 2025, primarily targeting young consumers with playful, youthful scents.\n\nBieber co-founded the casual apparel brand Drew House with stylist Ryan Good, trademarking the name in February 2018 and debuting it on December 25, 2018, with smiley-face slippers priced at $4.99. The full collection launched in January 2019, offering streetwear staples such as oversized T-shirts, hoodies, socks, and pajamas in neutral tones, with prices ranging from $48 to $148, emphasizing comfort and self-expression. The brand cultivated a grassroots following through limited drops and Bieber's personal endorsements, evolving from celebrity-driven to a cult label by 2022. Bieber disaffiliated from Drew House on April 10, 2025, stating it no longer represented him or his family and advising fans against purchases.\n\nIn 2025, Bieber introduced Skylrk as his first independent fashion venture, filing trademarks via SKYLRK Holdco, LLC in 2023 in collaboration with associate Neima Khaila. The brand launched on July 10, 2025, with comfort-focused items including zip-up hoodies, molded rubber sandals, and sculptural sunglasses, prioritizing relaxed, everyday wear.\n\n### Endorsements and entrepreneurial efforts\n\nBieber endorsed Proactiv skincare products, serving as a spokesmodel in advertisements starting around 2011. In 2010, he collaborated with Nicole by OPI to create the \"One Less Lonely Girl\" nail polish collection, featuring shades inspired by his song from the album *My World 2.0*. He signed a promotional deal with Adidas in the early 2010s, appearing in campaigns for their apparel and footwear lines.\n\nIn 2015, Bieber featured in a high-profile Calvin Klein advertising campaign, posing in underwear alongside model Lara Stone for the #MyCalvins initiative, which generated significant media attention and sales boosts for the brand. He later endorsed Schmidt's Naturals deodorants in 2017, promoting their natural ingredient products through social media and ads.\n\nEntrepreneurially, Bieber launched the women's fragrance *Someday* in June 2011 through Perfumania Holdings, with top notes of red berries, pear, and mandarin orange, targeting a youthful audience and achieving commercial success with over 400,000 units sold in its first year. In 2018, he co-founded the streetwear brand Drew House with longtime friend and stylist Ryan Good, debuting hoodies and apparel in 2019 that emphasized comfort and casual aesthetics, though Bieber publicly severed ties with the company in April 2025 amid reported internal disputes. Beyond consumer products, Bieber has pursued angel investing, committing to at least seven startups including cryptocurrency platform MoonPay and sports media venture TMRW Sports as of 2023.\n\n## Personal life\n\n### Family background and relationships\n\nJustin Bieber was born on March 1, 1994, in London, Ontario, Canada, to unmarried teenagers Patricia \"Pattie\" Mallette and Jeremy Jack Bieber. Mallette, aged 18 at the time, raised Bieber as a single mother in nearby Stratford, Ontario, amid financial hardship; she had endured a rape at age 14, battled depression and substance issues in her youth, and relied on government assistance while working low-wage jobs. Jeremy Bieber, also 18, had minimal early involvement due to his own troubles with petty crime and drug use, though he later reconnected with his son around age 13 and provided guidance during Bieber's rising fame, including co-managing aspects of his career.\n\nBieber has no full siblings, as his parents had no further children together, but maintains relationships with four paternal half-siblings from Jeremy's later partnerships: half-sister Allie (born 1998) from a pre-Justin relationship, half-sister Jazmyn (born 2008) and half-brother Jaxon (born 2009) with ex-wife Erin Wagner, and half-sister Bay (born 2018) with current wife Chelsey Bieber. These connections strengthened post-reconciliation with his father, with Bieber often sharing family moments publicly and describing his role as a supportive older brother.\n\nBieber's early romantic relationships emerged during his teen years amid fame. He briefly dated childhood acquaintance Caitlin Beadles, daughter of his mentor Ryan Beadles, around 2008–2009, before fame intensified public scrutiny. From 2010 to 2018, he maintained an on-and-off relationship with singer Selena Gomez, beginning as friends and evolving into a highly publicized pairing involving multiple breakups, reconciliations, and tabloid coverage of emotional volatility. Other short-term links included backup dancer Jasmine Villegas (2010), model Chantel Jeffries (January–February 2014), and reported flings with Jayde Pierce (2015) and Sofia Richie (2016), many confirmed via social media or public outings but lasting weeks to months amid his touring schedule and youth. A brief 2015 encounter with Kourtney Kardashian drew media attention but ended quickly, with both parties downplaying it as non-serious.\n\n### Marriage to Hailey Bieber and fatherhood\n\nJustin Bieber and Hailey Baldwin, who later took the surname Bieber, began dating in June 2018 after reconnecting at a Miami church event earlier that year, following years of intermittent friendship since meeting in 2009. Bieber proposed to Baldwin on July 7, 2018, during a Bahamas vacation, presenting a 6-carat oval diamond engagement ring valued at approximately $500,000. The couple obtained a marriage license in New York City on September 13, 2018, and wed that same day in a private civil ceremony at the city's courthouse, with Bieber's manager Scooter Braun serving as a witness; only Baldwin's father, actor Stephen Baldwin, was informed in advance.\n\nTheir ceremonial wedding occurred on September 30, 2019, at the Montage Palmetto Bluff resort in Bluffton, South Carolina, attended by 154 guests including celebrities such as Kylie Jenner, Kendall Jenner, Jaden Smith, and Bieber's former flame Selena Gomez's mother, Mandy Teefey.  The event featured a vegetarian menu, floral installations by Jamali Garden and Flowers, and a custom white Vera Wang gown for Baldwin, with Bieber wearing a Tom Ford tuxedo; the couple exchanged vows under a floral arch, reaffirming their commitment after the earlier legal union. Bieber later documented aspects of their relationship and weddings in his 2020 YouTube docuseries *Seasons*, emphasizing themes of personal growth and faith.\n\nThe Biebers announced the birth of their first child, a son named Jack Blues Bieber, on August 23, 2024, via Instagram posts expressing gratitude and describing the newborn as a source of overwhelming love. Hailey Bieber has described the pregnancy as unexpected, noting initial struggles to accept it amid her career demands, but affirmed Justin's active involvement as a father, stating he is \"always with his family\" and handles childcare when she is unavailable. In interviews, she has praised Bieber's parenting, calling him an attentive dad who prioritizes family time, though the couple maintains privacy around Jack's upbringing, sharing only occasional photos such as milestone celebrations. As of October 2025, Hailey Bieber has indicated plans for additional children, stating they \"definitely want more than one\" but are not rushing, citing enjoyment of parenthood while balancing professional lives.\n\n### Health challenges and recovery\n\nIn January 2020, Bieber disclosed his diagnosis with Lyme disease, a bacterial infection transmitted by ticks, alongside a severe case of chronic mononucleosis, which contributed to ongoing fatigue and health management challenges. These conditions necessitated long-term treatment, though Bieber continued professional activities while emphasizing rest and medical care.\n\nOn June 10, 2022, Bieber announced a diagnosis of Ramsay Hunt syndrome, a rare neurological complication of the varicella-zoster virus causing inflammation of the facial nerve, resulting in partial paralysis on the right side of his face, including inability to close his eye or fully smile. This led to the postponement of multiple dates on his Justice World Tour, with recovery prognosis uncertain but potentially aided by early antiviral and steroid interventions. He resumed touring in August 2022 after partial improvement, and by March 2023, demonstrated restored facial symmetry in public appearances. Further updates in May 2024 showed full facial mobility regained.\n\nBieber has publicly addressed mental health difficulties, including depression and anxiety exacerbated by early fame and substance use, which he linked to feelings of shame and relational strain beginning in his late teens. He reported initiating marijuana use around age 12 or 13, escalating to heavier drugs like Xanax by age 19, which he used to numb emotional distress but which intensified dependency and health risks, including informal detoxification efforts. Sobriety, achieved through pastoral counseling and lifestyle changes by 2019, involved adjunctive measures such as hyperbaric oxygen therapy and weekly intravenous nutrient infusions to support recovery from prior substance-related fatigue. As of 2025, sources indicate ongoing prioritization of family and mental well-being amid public speculation, with Bieber rejecting dependency on medications.\n\n### Religious beliefs and spiritual journey\n\nBieber's engagement with Christianity became publicly prominent during his adolescence, influenced by evangelical figures and his exposure to faith-based communities amid rising fame and personal challenges. In a 2011 interview, he described himself as a believer in Jesus Christ, emphasizing prayer and moral guidance from scripture as central to his life. By 2014, facing legal troubles and substance issues, Bieber underwent baptism on June 6 in a private ceremony conducted by Hillsong Church pastor Carl Lentz in the bathtub of NBA player Tyson Chandler's New Jersey home, an event Lentz later recounted as occurring spontaneously at 3 a.m. after Bieber expressed urgency for immersion.  This marked a turning point, with Bieber associating closely with Hillsong's New York branch, where Lentz served as a spiritual advisor.\n\nPost-baptism, Bieber integrated Christian themes into his music and public persona, particularly during the 2015 release of his album *Purpose*, which he attributed to a redemptive spiritual renewal. He stated that faith rendered him \"invincible,\" asserting \"if God's for me, who can be against me,\" and positioned Jesus as the ultimate healer capable of addressing personal failings beyond scientific explanation.  Bieber's involvement with Hillsong drew scrutiny following scandals, including Lentz's 2020 dismissal for \"moral failures\" involving infidelity and the church's broader issues with leadership accountability and celebrity favoritism, prompting Bieber to distance himself while affirming his independent commitment to Christianity. \n\nIn subsequent years, Bieber's spiritual expressions evolved toward nondenominational practices, including attendance at Churchome and regular Bible study, which he credited for navigating mental health struggles and relational stability. By 2021, he described faith as enabling him to embrace his designed purpose without self-judgment, viewing grace as a continual restorative force amid setbacks.  Recent statements in 2024 and 2025 reaffirm this trajectory, with Bieber declaring the Bible as his \"guideline\" for decisions and expressing deepened reliance on Jesus for forgiveness and strength, independent of institutional affiliations.  His wife, Hailey Bieber, shares this evangelical outlook, though Bieber's journey reflects personal conviction over denominational loyalty, evidenced by consistent public testimonies amid ongoing fame pressures.\n\n### Philanthropy and charitable work\n\nBieber has supported numerous charitable causes, with a focus on children's health, education, and disaster relief. In 2011, he launched the Believe Charity Drive, pledging portions of proceeds from his album *Under the Mistletoe* to organizations including the Children's Wish Foundation of Canada, Pencils of Promise, Make-A-Wish Foundation, Musicians on Call, Project Medishare for Haiti, and City of Hope. This initiative aimed to raise millions tied to his *Believe* album release the following year. He has partnered extensively with Pencils of Promise, an education nonprofit founded by his manager's brother, through campaigns like Schools4All, which encouraged fan donations to build schools in developing regions, and a 2012 effort that donated $20,000 split between Pencils of Promise and Make-A-Wish via a brand competition.\n\nA significant portion of Bieber's philanthropy involves the Make-A-Wish Foundation, where he earned recognition for granting wishes to children with critical illnesses. By August 2013, he had fulfilled his 200th wish, becoming the first recording artist to achieve that milestone for the organization. Reports indicate he granted over 250 wishes by 2015, ranking him among the top celebrity wish-granters, though surpassed overall by wrestler John Cena. In 2014, he received the Champ of Charity Award at the Young Hollywood Awards for this work, having granted a then-record 226 wishes.\n\nBieber has made direct donations for disaster and health relief, including over $3 million raised in 2013 for typhoon victims in the Philippines through partnerships with UNICEF, Action Against Hunger, and the Philam Foundation. In 2014, he pledged $545,000 to AIDS charities during a Cannes gala. Other contributions include $100,000 to a Las Vegas elementary school in December 2011 following a benefit concert, sponsorship of multiple clean water projects in Ethiopia and Sierra Leone via charity: water, a $77,000 raise for Haiti's 2021 earthquake relief, and donations supporting COVID-19 efforts, such as to the Beijing Chunmiao Children Aid Foundation in 2020. He has also backed broader causes like PETA animal welfare campaigns and Red Cross disaster response.\n\n## Controversies and legal issues\n\n### Early behavioral incidents and public outbursts\n\nIn October 2010, Bieber faced an investigation after being accused of assaulting a 12-year-old boy during a game at a laser tag arena in Norwalk, California, on October 18; authorities cleared him of wrongdoing following review of surveillance footage.\n\nDuring a shopping outing with then-girlfriend Selena Gomez in Los Angeles on May 12, 2012, Bieber was accused by paparazzo Jose Linebaugh of punching him in the face and damaging his camera, leading to a battery complaint; no charges were filed against Bieber.\n\nOn March 26, 2013, Bieber's neighbor Jason McDonald filed a battery report claiming the singer spat on him and issued threats during a driveway confrontation at their shared Calabasas, California, gated community; the incident stemmed from complaints about noise from Bieber's residence, and McDonald later sued in 2015 alleging ongoing harassment.\n\nA video leaked on July 10, 2013, captured Bieber and associates urinating into a mop bucket in the kitchen of a New York City restaurant after leaving a nightclub, with Bieber yelling \"Fuck Bill Clinton\" while spraying a framed photo of the former president with cleaning fluid; Bieber personally apologized to Clinton via intermediaries that day, stating he had acted immaturely.\n\nOn July 25, 2013, while staying at a Toronto hotel, Bieber faced allegations of spitting over his balcony toward a crowd of fans below, as claimed by witnesses and depicted in photographs; Bieber's representatives denied the act, asserting the images were misleading and that he was not targeting anyone.\n\nThese incidents, occurring amid Bieber's rapid ascent to global stardom as a teenager, highlighted a pattern of impulsive and confrontational actions often captured on video or reported by witnesses, drawing widespread media scrutiny.\n\n### Arrests, legal charges, and court outcomes\n\nOn January 9, 2014, Justin Bieber was implicated in vandalizing a neighbor's home in Calabasas, California, by throwing eggs that caused approximately $20,000 in damage to the property. He was charged with misdemeanor vandalism in July 2014 after Los Angeles prosecutors determined the evidence did not support felony charges. Bieber pleaded no contest to the charge on July 9, 2014, resulting in a sentence of two years' probation, five days of community service or anger management classes, and an order to pay $80,900 in restitution to the victims. \n\nOn January 23, 2014, Bieber was arrested in Miami Beach, Florida, for driving under the influence, drag racing, resisting an officer without violence, and driving with an expired license after police observed him speeding in a yellow Lamborghini alongside a rented red Ferrari. He was released on $2,500 bond following the arrest. In August 2014, Bieber entered a plea deal reducing the DUI charge to misdemeanor careless driving, to which he pleaded guilty, while also pleading guilty to resisting an officer; the expired license charge was dropped. The agreement required 50 hours of community service, 12 hours of anger management counseling, a $50,000 donation to a youth charity, and two years' probation, avoiding jail time.\n\nIn June 2015, Bieber pleaded guilty to charges of assault and careless driving stemming from an August 2013 incident in Ontario, Canada, where he allegedly assaulted a limousine driver during a dispute. He received a $750 fine and no criminal record as part of the resolution. No further arrests or significant legal charges have been reported against Bieber since these cases.\n\n### Drug allegations and personal struggles\n\nJustin Bieber began using marijuana around age 12 or 13, initially as a means to cope with the pressures of early fame. This dependency escalated during his teenage years, leading to experimentation with harder substances including codeine-based lean, ecstasy (Molly), psilocybin mushrooms, and various pills, which he later described as an attempt to numb emotional pain and escape reality.\n\nOn January 23, 2014, Bieber was arrested in Miami Beach, Florida, for driving under the influence, drag racing, and resisting an officer without violence; a subsequent urine toxicology test confirmed the presence of THC (marijuana's active metabolite) and alprazolam (Xanax). He pleaded guilty to lesser charges of careless driving and resisting arrest, avoiding jail time through anger management and community service, but the incident fueled public speculation about ongoing substance abuse.\n\nBieber has publicly admitted that his drug use intensified to the point where he woke up daily smoking marijuana and taking pills, with security personnel monitoring his pulse nightly due to overdose risks from severe intoxication. In a 2019 BBC interview, he linked heavy substance abuse to depression and relational issues stemming from rapid stardom, acknowledging patterns of emotional numbness and self-destructive behavior.\n\nBy 2020, in his YouTube docuseries *Seasons*, Bieber detailed achieving sobriety after therapy, faith-based interventions, and support from his wife Hailey Bieber, though he later revealed ongoing battles with Xanax and alcohol addiction into the early 2020s. These struggles, exacerbated by childhood trauma and the isolation of fame, prompted periodic withdrawals from public life for treatment, with Bieber emphasizing personal accountability over external excuses in his recovery narrative.\n\n### Recent rumors and public scrutiny\n\nIn 2025, Justin Bieber faced renewed public scrutiny over his health and substance use, fueled by social media posts and fan concerns about his appearance, including gaunt features and erratic behavior observed in videos. Bieber's February posts showing him smoking marijuana and subsequent captions referencing past drug experiences reignited speculation, with some outlets linking it to his admitted history of using substances like lean, pills, MDMA, and mushrooms since age 23. His representatives dismissed these as \"salacious\" and \"harmful\" rumors in February 2025, emphasizing his focus on fatherhood after son Jack Blues's birth in August 2024 and ongoing recovery from Ramsay Hunt syndrome.\n\nBieber addressed the speculation directly in his surprise album *Swag II*, released in July 2025, with lyrics in tracks like \"Speed Demon\" and \"Walking Away\" rejecting narratives of relapse and affirming personal growth amid public doubt. In July, he shared \"detox\" selfies from Spain, sweating profusely, which some interpreted as evidence of wellness efforts at a clinic like The Balance, though no confirmation emerged. A July 21 repost of rapper DMX discussing avoidance of a \"clean\" life drew further concern, but Bieber has not endorsed active hard drug use, contrasting with his 2020 documentary admissions of past dependency.\n\nMarriage rumors intensified in early 2025, with speculation of a split from Hailey Bieber amid reports of tension post-childbirth and Bieber's independent travels. Hailey described their union as a \"crazy life\" in July 2025 interviews, navigating external pressures, but affirmed commitment, noting slim divorce odds due to shared faith. Bieber countered by posting affectionate images from a Spanish getaway, captioning Hailey his \"forever n always\" on July 7. Persistent tabloid claims of Hailey managing his career were labeled \"stupid\" and \"ridiculous\" by her in October 2025, highlighting how unverified social media narratives amplify scrutiny on their private life.\n\nAdditional rumors included unfounded death hoaxes in October 2025 and vague accusations of financial decline, often traced to anonymous social media without evidence. Bieber shifted focus to non-music pursuits, announcing daily personal gigs in October, amid calls from fans for privacy as he balances recovery and family. These episodes underscore a pattern where celebrity visibility invites speculative commentary, often detached from verified personal progress.",
