These Old World natives employ constriction as their primary hunting method, encircling prey with muscular coils that apply escalating pressure to induce circulatory arrest and cardiac failure, rather than asphyxiation alone, as evidenced by physiological studies on constrictors showing rapid cessation of blood flow and heartbeat within seconds to minutes. Pythons exhibit primitive anatomical traits relative to more derived snakes, including two fully functional lungs—in contrast to the single elongated lung in most serpents—and vestigial hind limbs manifested as small, clawed spurs used in mating or locomotion.\n\nAmong the largest species, the reticulated python (*Python reticulatus*) holds the record for maximum length, with reliable measurements exceeding 6.25 meters and historical reports, such as a 1912 specimen, reaching up to 10 meters, though such extremes are rare and often unverified under anesthesia. The Burmese python (*Python bivittatus*), native to Southeast Asia, attains lengths of 5-6 meters and has established invasive populations in Florida's Everglades following escapes and releases from the pet trade since the 1990s, preying on native mammals and contributing to documented population declines of over 90% in species like raccoons and opossums. Habitats vary by species, spanning terrestrial savannas, grasslands, and wetlands to semi-arboreal forests, where some climb low branches for ambush positions, though most favor ground-level cover for thermoregulation and concealment.\n\nReproduction is oviparous, with females producing clutches of 20 to 100 eggs depending on species size, such as 20-50 in ball pythons (*Python regius*) or up to 100 in larger forms like the African rock python (*Python sebae*). Incubation lasts 50-60 days at temperatures of 30-32°C, maintained by maternal brooding where the female coils around the clutch and generates heat through shivering thermogenesis—rapid muscle contractions producing up to 5-10°C elevation above ambient levels, even in the presence of external warmth. In captivity, pythons achieve lifespans of 20-30 years or more with proper husbandry, exceeding wild averages limited by predation and disease, as recorded in species like the ball python reaching 28 years in zoological settings. Ecologically, pythons serve as apex predators regulating rodent and small mammal populations in native ranges, though invasives like the Burmese python disrupt food webs by outcompeting and depredating endemic fauna without corresponding predators.\n\n## Computing\n\n### Python Programming Language\n\nPython is a high-level programming language designed for readability and simplicity, created by Guido van Rossum in 1990 while working at the Centrum Wiskunde \\u0026 Informatica (CWI) in Amsterdam, Netherlands. Its implementation began in December 1989 as a successor to the ABC language, with the first public release occurring in February 1991. Python enforces code structure through significant whitespace indentation rather than delimiters like braces, a deliberate choice to reduce syntactic noise and promote consistent formatting. The language is interpreted via an interactive shell, dynamically typed—meaning variable types are determined at runtime—and employs automatic garbage collection for memory management, avoiding manual allocation common in lower-level languages.\n\nThe core implementation, CPython, compiles source code to bytecode executed by a virtual machine written in C, supporting procedural, object-oriented, and functional paradigms through its standard library and extensions. This design prioritizes developer productivity over raw performance, enabling concise code for tasks like scripting and prototyping; for instance, a basic \"Hello, World\" program requires just `print(\"Hello, World\")`. However, the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in CPython acquires a lock on the interpreter during bytecode execution, ensuring thread safety for reference counting but preventing multiple native threads from executing Python code simultaneously on multi-core processors, thus limiting scalability for CPU-bound parallelism. Workarounds include multiprocessing or external libraries like NumPy, which release the GIL for vectorized operations.\n\nVersion 2.0, released in October 2000, introduced list comprehensions and garbage collection improvements, while Python 3.0 in December 2008 implemented Unicode strings, integer division changes, and print as a function to address long-standing inconsistencies, rendering it incompatible with Python 2. The transition proved contentious, with legacy codebases delaying adoption; Python 2.7 reached end-of-life on January 1, 2020, after which no further updates or security fixes were provided by the Python Software Foundation. Python 3.13, released October 7, 2024, delivered a 10-60% speedup in single-threaded execution via an adaptive interpreter specializing common patterns, alongside experimental \"free-threaded\" builds disabling the GIL to enable multi-core threading, though with a 15-20% single-thread overhead. As of October 2025, Python commands the top spot in the TIOBE Index, reflecting sustained dominance amid battles for second place among C, C++, and Java.\n\nEmpirical data underscores Python's causal impact on software development: the 2025 Stack Overflow Developer Survey reported a 7 percentage point rise in usage over 2024, reaching approximately 50% of respondents, fueled by its role in AI/machine learning ecosystems via libraries like TensorFlow (for deep learning models) and PyTorch (for dynamic neural networks), alongside NumPy for array operations accelerating data analysis. Web development has resurged, with FastAPI adoption surging for asynchronous APIs, per JetBrains' State of Developer Ecosystem 2025. These strengths—simple syntax reducing development time by factors of 3-5x versus C++ for prototypes—have democratized fields like data science, where Python scripts process terabytes via Pandas, but at the cost of runtime efficiency.\n\nCritics highlight trade-offs: interpreted execution yields 10-100x slower performance than compiled C++ for loops or numerical computations, as benchmarks show Python taking seconds where C++ completes in milliseconds for tasks like summing billions of elements. The GIL exacerbates this for multithreading, often necessitating process-based concurrency that incurs inter-process communication overhead, unsuitable for latency-sensitive applications. Educational overemphasis on Python, now dominant in curricula, risks shallow comprehension of memory models or optimization, as novices bypass compiled-language discipline; surveys note 80%+ introductory courses use it, potentially hindering transitions to systems programming. Controversies persist in Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs), such as PEP 703 (2023) advancing optional GIL removal amid performance regressions debates, and corporate funding—Google's contributions since 2006 influencing tools like TensorFlow—raising concerns over open-source priorities versus proprietary integrations. Despite these, Python's ecosystem, with over 500,000 PyPI packages, sustains its utility for non-performance-critical domains, evidencing a deliberate paradigm shift toward expressiveness over speed.\n\n## Entertainment\n\n### Monty Python Comedy Troupe\n\nThe Monty Python comedy troupe, comprising Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, and Michael Palin—five of whom were alumni of Oxford or Cambridge universities—formed in 1969 to produce innovative sketch-based television comedy. The group coalesced from prior collaborations in university revues and BBC programs like *At Last the 1948 Show*, enabling a shared style rooted in surrealism, wordplay, and subversion of British institutional norms. Their debut series, *Monty Python's Flying Circus*, aired on BBC1 starting October 5, 1969, and ran for 45 episodes across four seasons until December 5, 1974, featuring non-sequential sketches that rejected traditional punchlines in favor of abrupt transitions and escalating absurdity, such as the \"Dead Parrot\" routine mocking customer service evasion.\n\nThe troupe extended their work to feature films, with *Monty Python and the Holy Grail* (1975) parodying Arthurian legend through low-budget effects—like coconut shells simulating horse sounds—and meta-narrative interruptions, grossing significantly in the U.S. as the highest-box-office British film there at the time. Subsequent productions included *Life of Brian* (1979), a satire of religious dogma that sparked protests from clergy for scenes depicting messianic confusion, and *The Meaning of Life* (1983), their final collaborative film anthology critiquing existential and societal themes. Commercial ventures encompassed live stage tours, record albums like *Monty Python's Previous Record* (1972), and books compiling scripts, yielding sustained revenue amid the BBC's initial hesitance over the material's edginess. Individual members pursued solo projects, notably Cleese's *Fawlty Towers* (1975–1979), which amplified Python-esque farce in a hotel management setting.\n\nMonty Python's influence reshaped satirical comedy by prioritizing visual non-sequiturs and anti-authoritarian irreverence, directly inspiring creators like Matt Groening of *The Simpsons* and Trey Parker of *South Park*, who emulated its boundary-testing animation and parody techniques. This approach disrupted 1960s–1970s television conventions, fostering a legacy of cult fandom evidenced by enduring catchphrases such as \"Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition!\" from a 1970 sketch exaggerating historical fanaticism through repetitive surprise tactics. The Python programming language (1989) was named in homage to the troupe's irreverent style, reflecting its appeal among technical communities valuing logical absurdity. In 2025, *Holy Grail*'s 50th anniversary prompted theatrical re-releases and retrospectives affirming its structural innovations, though the group has produced no new collaborative works since 1983.\n\nCritiques of the troupe's content often highlight sketches involving racial stereotypes, gender roles, or violence—such as the \"Undertakers\" routine's black humor on death—as offensively provocative by contemporary standards, yet these were contextually boundary-pushing responses to era-specific censorship rather than endorsement. Cleese has defended such elements against modern \"offense\" culture, arguing they enabled freer expression than today's sanitized norms. Academic analyses credit Python's causal emphasis on logical inconsistency for influencing postmodern humor studies, sustaining its relevance amid evolving sensitivities.\n\n### Roller Coasters\n\nThe Python at Efteling theme park in Kaatsheuvel, Netherlands, is a steel roller coaster manufactured by Vekoma and opened on May 9, 1981. It features a chain lift hill leading to a 95-foot (29-meter) height, with a maximum speed of 46.6 miles per hour (75 km/h) and four inversions including two loops and two corkscrews, utilizing a custom looping track design typical of early Vekoma models.) The ride's 2-minute, 8-second duration emphasizes sustained G-forces through its compact layout, reflecting the 1980s trend toward steel coasters with multiple inversions for enhanced thrill over traditional wooden structures.\n\nAt Busch Gardens Tampa Bay in Tampa, Florida, the Python was an Arrow Dynamics steel roller coaster that debuted on July 1, 1976, marking the park's inaugural coaster and Florida's first to incorporate inversions.) Standing 72 feet (22 meters) tall with a top speed of 40 miles per hour (64 km/h), it spanned 1,200 feet (366 meters) and included two inversions via a double corkscrew element, delivering abrupt drops and lateral forces characteristic of Arrow's early steel designs from the mid-1970s shift away from wood. Operations ceased after the final run on October 31, 2006, due to structural aging and escalating maintenance demands, with the ride demolished in 2008 to accommodate park updates.)\n\nKissel Entertainment operates a portable Zyklon-style steel roller coaster named Python, refurbished for touring carnivals following its prior installation at Coney Island in Cincinnati, Ohio, from 1999 to 2019.) This model reaches 40 feet (12 meters) in height over a 1,100-foot (335-meter) track, achieving a 1-minute, 24-second ride focused on hairpin turns and moderate drops rather than extreme inversions, aligning with the durable, relocatable engineering of DPV Rides Zyklon variants used in mobile amusement setups since the late 20th century.) Such coasters exemplify the industry's adaptation of fixed-park steel technology for itinerant operations, prioritizing cost-effective portability over high-speed thrills.\n\n## Weaponry\n\n### Colt Python Revolver\n\nThe Colt Python is a double-action revolver chambered in .357 Magnum, introduced by Colt's Manufacturing Company in 1955 as a premium handgun emphasizing precision engineering and target-grade accuracy. Built on Colt's I-frame platform with a 6-round swing-out cylinder, it features vent-rib barrels available in lengths from 2.5 to 8 inches, interchangeable with .38 Special ammunition for reduced recoil training, and is renowned for its exceptionally smooth double-action trigger pull—typically 7-9 pounds—facilitating rapid, accurate follow-up shots in self-defense scenarios. Early models used blued carbon steel construction, with stainless steel variants introduced in the 1980s to enhance corrosion resistance, contributing to its reputation for mechanical reliability under sustained fire.\n\nBallistically, the Python delivers high stopping power from .357 Magnum loads, with a 6-inch barrel achieving muzzle velocities of approximately 1,388 to 1,445 feet per second for 125-grain jacketed hollow points, generating energies exceeding 500 foot-pounds—effective for penetrating barriers or large game while maintaining sub-2-inch groups at 25 yards in controlled tests. Weighing around 46 ounces unloaded in its 6-inch configuration, the revolver mitigates recoil through its H-frame grip design, though lighter 2.5- or 4-inch models exhibit sharper muzzle flip with full-power magnum rounds, limiting their practicality for extended sport shooting without grip modifications. Compared to contemporaries like the Smith \\u0026 Wesson Model 686, the Python offers marginally superior inherent accuracy due to its rigidly locked barrel-cylinder gap and ventilated rib aiding heat dissipation, though some users report the S\\u0026W's double-action pull as lighter and its overall timing as more consistent over high round counts.\n\nProduction ceased in 2005 amid declining revolver demand, but Colt reintroduced the Python in 2020 with modern enhancements, including a reinforced top strap (30% stronger material), simplified internals reducing part count by 14 for improved durability, and precision-machined components yielding a crisper single-action break under 3 pounds. Available in stainless steel with 4.25- or 6-inch barrels, adjustable rear sights, and optional walnut grips, these models retail above $1,500, reflecting premium pricing justified by enhanced reliability over vintage units prone to timing issues from wear. Despite criticisms of stout recoil in compact variants and historical production inconsistencies, the Python remains a benchmark for revolvers suited to defensive or competitive use, where its mechanical finesse outperforms many polymer-framed alternatives in raw ballistic delivery.\n\n### Python Air-to-Air Missiles\n\nThe Python family comprises a series of short- to medium-range air-to-air missiles developed by Israel's Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, originating in the 1970s as derivatives of the U.S. AIM-9 Sidewinder based on Israeli Air Force operational experience with early heat-seeking missiles. Initial variants like the Python-3, introduced in the 1980s, expanded to all-aspect infrared guidance with enhanced electronic counter-countermeasures (ECCM) capabilities compared to predecessors. The Python-4, entering service in the 1990s, further refined ECCM through fiber-optic data links for real-time guidance updates and achieved high maneuverability via aerodynamic controls, supporting off-boresight angles up to 60 degrees.\n\nThe Python-5, operational since 2003, represents the fifth-generation pinnacle of the lineage with an advanced imaging infrared seeker that enables full-sphere launch envelopes and extremely high off-boresight targeting exceeding 90 degrees, allowing engagement of targets in any direction relative to the launching aircraft.  It incorporates thrust vectoring for superior agility, sustaining high-g turns while resisting infrared countermeasures through multi-spectral detection and electronic protection measures. Effective ranges extend beyond 20 kilometers in beyond-visual-range scenarios, with lock-on after launch functionality for flexible targeting.\n\nCombat deployments have validated the series' efficacy, including the Python-5's first confirmed kill during the 2006 Lebanon War against hostile aircraft, demonstrating reliable performance under operational stress without reported systemic failures. Rafael describes the Python-5 as combat-proven with high kill probabilities across diverse encounter geometries. The missile's dual-use adaptability extends to ground-based roles in the SPYDER air defense system, where Python-5 variants provide quick-reaction intercepts against aircraft, drones, and cruise missiles at low altitudes.\n\nWidely exported for their engineering robustness, Python missiles equip air forces in countries including India and Brazil, with Brazil receiving Python-3 and Python-4 units in the early 2000s alongside compatible aircraft. Integration occurs on platforms like the F-16 and Mirage series, emphasizing compatibility with standard AIM-9 launchers and minimal adaptation needs. Performance metrics highlight consistent hit rates in testing and service, attributed to seeker precision and propulsion efficiency rather than unverified claims of infallibility.\n\n## People\n\n### Notable Individuals Named Python\n\nPython of Aenus (fl. 4th century BCE) was an ancient Greek philosopher and student of Plato. Around 360 BCE, he and his brother Heraclides assassinated Cotys I, the king of the Odrysian Thracians.\n\nPython, active circa 360–320 BCE, was a prominent Greek red-figure vase painter based in Paestum (ancient Poseidonia), a Greek colony in southern Italy. He signed several works, including a bell-krater in the British Museum depicting mythological scenes, and contributed significantly to the distinctive Paestan style, often collaborating with the workshop of Asteas. His vases, produced during the late Classical period, feature vibrant depictions of satyrs, maenads, and Dionysiac themes typical of South Italian ceramics.\n\nHistorical records yield few other verifiable individuals named Python with notable contributions, reflecting the name's rarity outside mythological contexts.\n\n## Miscellaneous Uses\n\n### Vehicles and Transportation\n\nThe WaterCar Python, developed in the early 2000s as a prototype amphibious vehicle, combined automotive and marine propulsion to achieve high speeds on both land and water, with a claimed quarter-mile time in the mid-12 seconds on land and acceleration to 60 mph in approximately 4.5 seconds in water. Only two prototypes were produced, one of which was listed for sale in 2010 at $250,000, highlighting its status as a limited experimental design rather than a production model.\n\nCobra Performance Boats has offered Python-branded high-speed watercraft, such as the 280W Python model introduced around 2021, featuring outboard engines like the Mercury 600 for enhanced performance in recreational boating. Earlier variants, including the 270 Python showcased in 2019 events like the Desert Storm Poker Run, utilized custom marine engines such as the Teague 825 for top speeds exceeding typical pleasure craft limits. These fiberglass hull designs emphasize planing hull efficiency for rough water handling but remain niche offerings targeted at performance enthusiasts rather than broad markets.\n\nMotorcycles bearing the Python name include the Bourget's Bike Works Python MT, a custom chopper produced in the early 2000s with an 1840cc V-twin engine and 6-speed transmission, exemplifying chopper aesthetics with extended forks and minimal bodywork for visual appeal over everyday utility. Similarly, the X-PRO Python 250, a street-legal dirt-style bike with a 223cc air-cooled engine, 6-speed manual transmission, and electric start, achieves top speeds over 65 mph, positioning it as an affordable entry-level option assembled primarily for off-road and light on-road use. Historical prototypes like Smokey Yunick's Python Roadster from the 1960s featured a banking suspension system mimicking motorcycle lean dynamics across all four wheels, though it never entered production due to engineering complexities and safety concerns.\n\nNo mass-produced automobiles or locomotives have carried the Python designation, with applications confined to these specialized, low-volume designs where the name evokes agility or power without direct ties to serpentine biology.\n\n### Mythology and Etymology\n\nIn Greek mythology, Python was a gigantic serpent or drakon offspring of the primordial goddess Gaia, tasked with guarding the chthonic oracle at Delphi, a site associated with earth vapors and prophetic inspiration. According to the *Homeric Hymn to Apollo* (composed between the late 7th and mid-6th centuries BCE), the infant god Apollo journeyed to Delphi, encountered the monstrous Python coiled around the site, and slew it with a volley of arrows before claiming the oracle for his own prophetic cult. This narrative serves as an etiological explanation for Apollo's dominance over the Delphic sanctuary, transitioning it from a pre-Olympian earth deity's domain to one under solar and oracular control, rather than recounting verifiable historical events.\n\nThe name \"Python\" derives from the ancient Greek Πύθων (Púthōn), linked to the pre-Hellenic name for Delphi (Pytho) and possibly rooted in πύθεσθαι (pýthesthai, \"to rot\" or \"decompose\"), evoking the mephitic vapors emanating from fissures at the site that were mythically tied to prophetic trance states. These vapors, interpreted in the myth as Python's decaying essence or breath, allegorically represent natural phenomena like marsh gases dispersed by sunlight (symbolized by Apollo), but no archaeological or geological evidence substantiates a literal serpent carcass or divine intervention as causal factors in the oracle's origins. Later Hellenistic and Roman sources, such as Ovid's *Metamorphoses* (8 CE), embellish Python as a multi-headed dragon, but these variants prioritize poetic elaboration over the Hymn's concise etiology.\n\nThe mythological Python influenced biological nomenclature when Carl Linnaeus, in the 10th edition of *Systema Naturae* (1758), established the genus *Python* for large constricting snakes of the Old World, drawing on the serpent's imagery of immense size and coiling predation rather than any supposed wisdom or harmony with nature. This taxonomic choice reflects empirical observation of serpentine morphology—pythons as ambush predators that subdue prey through constriction—without endorsing mythic literalism, as Linnaeus prioritized classificatory utility grounded in physical traits over symbolic or supernatural attributions. Cultural resonances of Python persist in modern nomenclature and symbolism, but they stem from linguistic inheritance rather than direct causal continuity with ancient rituals or ecology.",
