  "content": "# Peter Thiel\n\n# Peter Thiel\n\n## Introduction\n\nPeter Andreas Thiel (born October 11, 1967) is a German-American entrepreneur, venture capitalist, and political activist. He is best known as a co-founder of PayPal, an early investor in Facebook, and the founder of Palantir Technologies, a data analytics company. Thiel has been a prominent figure in Silicon Valley, shaping the tech industry through his investments and libertarian-leaning political views. His influence extends beyond technology into areas such as education reform, futurism, and conservative politics, often sparking debate due to his unconventional perspectives and actions.\n\nThiel's career is marked by his ability to identify and support transformative technologies, as well as his willingness to challenge societal norms. This article provides an overview of his life, career, and impact, maintaining a neutral perspective on his contributions and controversies.\n\n## Historical Background\n\n### Early Life and Education\nPeter Thiel was born in Frankfurt, West Germany, to a chemical engineer father, Klaus Thiel, and his wife, Susanne. The family moved to the United States when Thiel was a child, settling in Cleveland, Ohio, before relocating to Foster City, California. Thiel showed an early aptitude for mathematics and chess, becoming a nationally ranked chess player by his teens [Chess.com Profile](https://www.chess.com/players/peter-thiel).\n\nHe attended Stanford University, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy in 1989 and later a Juris Doctor from Stanford Law School in 1992. During his time at Stanford, Thiel co-founded *The Stanford Review*, a conservative-libertarian student newspaper, which reflected his early interest in political and cultural issues [Stanford Review History](https://stanfordreview.org/about/).\n\n### Early Career and PayPal\nAfter law school, Thiel briefly worked as a lawyer and judicial clerk before transitioning to finance, working as a derivatives trader at Credit Suisse. However, his entrepreneurial ambitions led him to Silicon Valley. In 1998, Thiel co-founded PayPal (initially named Confinity) with Max Levchin and Luke Nosek. The company focused on digital payments and became a pioneer in online financial transactions. PayPal merged with Elon Musk’s X.com in 2000, and Thiel served as CEO until the company was acquired by eBay in 2002 for $1.5 billion. Thiel personally earned approximately $55 million from the sale, which became the foundation for his future investments [PayPal History](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/about).\n\n### Venture Capital and Facebook Investment\nFollowing PayPal’s success, Thiel founded Clarium Capital, a global macro hedge fund, in 2002. However, he gained wider recognition as a venture capitalist through his early investment in Facebook. In 2004, Thiel provided a $500,000 angel investment for a 10.2% stake in the social media platform, becoming its first outside investor. His investment paid off massively when Facebook went public in 2012, cementing his reputation as a visionary investor [Forbes Profile](https://www.forbes.com/profile/peter-thiel/).\n\nThiel also co-founded Founders Fund in 2005, a venture capital firm that has backed numerous successful startups, including SpaceX, Airbnb, and Spotify. His investment philosophy often emphasizes contrarian thinking, focusing on companies that challenge established industries [Founders Fund](https://foundersfund.com/).\n\n### Palantir Technologies\nIn 2003, Thiel co-founded Palantir Technologies with Alex Karp and others, aiming to create software for data analysis and surveillance. Named after the \"seeing stones\" in J.R.R. Tolkien’s *The Lord of the Rings*, Palantir initially focused on government contracts, particularly with intelligence agencies like the CIA, for counterterrorism efforts. The company later expanded into commercial sectors. Palantir went public in 2020, further solidifying Thiel’s influence in the tech world, though its work with government entities has drawn criticism for privacy concerns [Palantir Overview](https://www.palantir.com/).\n\n## Current Status and Relevance\n\nAs of 2023, Peter Thiel remains a significant figure in technology, finance, and politics. He continues to lead Founders Fund, which manages billions in assets and invests in cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence and biotechnology. Thiel’s net worth is estimated at over $7 billion, placing him among the wealthiest individuals in Silicon Valley [Bloomberg Billionaires Index](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/profiles/peter-a-thiel/).\n\nThiel has also become increasingly active in politics, aligning himself with conservative and populist causes. He was a prominent supporter of Donald Trump during the 2016 U.S. presidential election, donating over $1 million to Trump’s campaign and speaking at the Republican National Convention. His political involvement has made him a polarizing figure, with some praising his willingness to challenge progressive orthodoxy in tech, while others criticize his support for controversial policies [Politico Coverage](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/11/peter-thiel-tech-mogul-shy-politics-424).\n\nAdditionally, Thiel has expressed skepticism about higher education, creating the Thiel Fellowship in 2011, which offers young entrepreneurs $100,000 to skip college and pursue their business ideas. This initiative reflects his belief that traditional education often stifles innovation [Thiel Fellowship](https://thielfellowship.org/).\n\n## Notable Facts and Details\n\n- **Philosophical Influence**: Thiel has been heavily influenced by libertarian thinkers such as Ayn Rand and economist Friedrich Hayek.
