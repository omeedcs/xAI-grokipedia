# Drake

Aubrey Drake Graham (born October 24, 1986), known professionally as Drake, is a Canadian rapper, singer, songwriter, and actor who rose to prominence portraying Jimmy Brooks, a wheelchair-using teenager, on the television series *Degrassi: The Next Generation* from 2001 to 2008. Transitioning to music, he released independent mixtapes that led to a recording contract with Young Money Entertainment, launching a career defined by melodic rap innovation and unprecedented commercial dominance, including holding the RIAA record for most Diamond-certified records with 16 as of October 2025.

Drake's discography features multi-platinum albums such as *Take Care* (2011), which earned him his first Grammy Award for Best Rap Album, and singles like "God's Plan" (2018), winning Best Rap Song. He has amassed 359 entries on the Billboard Hot 100, the most by any artist, and received Billboard's Artist of the Decade designation in 2021. His five Grammy wins and over 244 million RIAA-certified digital single units as lead artist underscore his influence in blending hip-hop, R\u0026B, and pop sensibilities.

Drake's path has included high-profile rivalries with peers, culminating in a January 2025 federal defamation lawsuit against Universal Music Group alleging the label promoted Kendrick Lamar's "Not Like Us" to falsely imply pedophilia, a claim amplified by its Super Bowl performance. The ongoing litigation highlights tensions in his business relationships amid sustained chart success.

## Animals and creatures

### Birds

In ornithology, a drake denotes an adult male duck, distinguishing it from the female, which is termed a hen or simply a duck. This terminology applies specifically to species within the family Anatidae, emphasizing sexual dimorphism where drakes typically exhibit brighter, more iridescent plumage during breeding seasons to attract mates, such as the green head of the mallard (*Anas platyrhynchos*) drake.

The word "drake" derives from Middle English *drake*, rooted in Old English *draca* or Proto-Germanic *drakô*, originally connoting a dragon or serpent but evolving in Germanic dialects to specify a male duck, possibly due to phonetic parallels or behavioral associations like aggressive mating displays. By the 14th century, it was established in English for waterfowl, as evidenced in early texts distinguishing drakes from hens in poultry and wild populations.

Drakes play key roles in duck reproduction and ecology; unpaired males, often younger or subordinate, may form bachelor groups, while breeding drakes perform courtship rituals including head-bobbing and wing-flapping. In species like the wood duck (*Aix sponsa*), the drake's vibrant crest and multicolored feathers contrast sharply with the hen's subdued camouflage, aiding survival strategies. Population dynamics show drakes sometimes outnumber hens in adult flocks due to higher female mortality from incubation duties, influencing hunting regulations in regions like North America.

### Mythical creatures

In European folklore and mythology, a drake denotes a dragon-like creature, with the term deriving from Old English *draca*, rooted in Proto-Germanic *drakô* and Latin *draco*, all signifying a serpent or monstrous reptile. This usage appears interchangeably with "dragon" in medieval texts, portraying drakes as large, often fire-breathing beasts associated with hoarding treasure and wreaking destruction. Unlike modern fantasy classifications distinguishing drakes as wingless quadrupeds, historical accounts lack such rigid taxonomy, treating the terms as synonymous without emphasis on limb or wing counts.

A prominent example occurs in the Old English epic *Beowulf*, dated to between the 8th and 11th centuries, where the hero confronts a *fīrdraca* (fire-drake), a serpentine monster roughly 50 feet long that breathes flames and guards a subterranean hoard. The creature emerges after a stolen cup provokes its rage, ravaging the Geatish countryside until Beowulf mortally wounds it, though he himself perishes from the encounter. This narrative reflects broader Germanic traditions of drakes as embodiments of chaos and greed, often slain by heroes to restore order.

In regional variations, such as northern English folklore, drakes manifest as earth-bound serpents or demonic entities, exemplified by the Drake Stone in Derbyshire, a prehistoric monolith legendarily linked to a treasure-guarding drake or devil that locals attempted to excavate but failed to subdue. Germanic Low German folklore occasionally depicts *Drak* or *Drake* as mischievous household spirits akin to kobolds, smelling of sulfur and performing chores or mischief, though these diverge from the reptilian archetype and blend with demonic traits rather than pure draconic forms. Such fluidity underscores drakes' role as versatile symbols of peril in pre-modern cosmology, grounded in oral traditions rather than standardized mythologies.

## People

### Historical figures

Sir Francis Drake (c. 1540–1596) was an English naval commander, explorer, and privateer who served the Elizabethan regime by raiding Spanish colonial assets in the Americas and beyond. Born in Tavistock, Devon, to a Protestant farmer's family amid religious tensions under Catholic Queen Mary I, Drake apprenticed at sea early and joined his cousin John Hawkins on slaving voyages to West Africa and the Caribbean starting in 1567, where Spanish forces destroyed their fleet at San Juan de Ulúa in 1568, fueling Drake's lifelong enmity toward Spain.

Drake's most renowned exploit was his 1577–1580 circumnavigation of the globe aboard the *Golden Hind*, commissioned secretly by Queen Elizabeth I to plunder Spanish possessions. Departing Plymouth with five ships and 164 men, he navigated the Strait of Magellan, raided Valparaíso and other Pacific ports, seizing over 100,000 pounds of Spanish treasure, and returned via the Cape of Good Hope with only the *Golden Hind* intact, claiming California for England at Nova Albion. This voyage netted investors returns exceeding 4,700 percent and established Drake as the first English captain to complete the feat, enhancing England's maritime prestige against Iberian monopoly. Elizabeth knighted him aboard his ship at Deptford in 1581.

As vice admiral under Lord Howard of Effingham, Drake contributed decisively to the 1588 defeat of the Spanish Armada, applying fireships at Calais and pursuing survivors, which crippled Philip II's invasion force of 130 vessels and shifted naval power toward Protestant England. Later commands included the 1589 Portugal expedition and a 1595 West Indies raid with Hawkins, where both perished from dysentery off Puerto Rico; Drake died on 28 December 1596 near Portobelo, Panama, during an unsuccessful assault, and was buried at sea. His actions, blending exploration, piracy, and warfare, advanced English colonial ambitions while amassing personal wealth estimated at over half a million pounds, though Spanish accounts vilified him as *El Draque*, the dragon.

Less prominent historical figures include Francis William Drake (1724–1787), a Royal Navy officer and colonial governor of Newfoundland who commanded in the War of the Austrian Succession and American Revolutionary War, capturing Guadeloupe in 1759.

### Contemporary figures

Aubrey Drake Graham (born October 24, 1986), known professionally as Drake, is a Canadian rapper, singer, songwriter, and actor who rose to prominence through acting before dominating the music industry.  Born in Toronto to a Black American father, Dennis Graham, a drummer, and a white Canadian mother, Sandi Graham, an florist, Drake's parents divorced when he was five, leading him to be raised primarily by his mother in a middle-class neighborhood. He gained initial fame portraying Jimmy Brooks, a basketball player turned wheelchair user, on the teen drama series *Degrassi: The Next Generation* from 2001 to 2008, appearing in over 100 episodes.

Transitioning to music in 2006, Drake released his debut mixtape *Room for Improvement* independently, followed by the breakout *So Far Gone* in 2009, which featured hits like "Best I Ever Had" and peaked at number six on the Billboard 200. His debut studio album *Thank Me Later* (2010) debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, certified platinum, and included the single "Find Your Love." Drake has since released multiple number-one albums, including *Take Care* (2011), *Nothing Was the Same* (2013), and *Scorpion* (2018), amassing over 170 million records sold worldwide and holding records for most Billboard Hot 100 entries by a rapper (347 as of 2023). He has won four Grammy Awards, including Best Rap Album for *Take Care* in 2013, and founded the OVO Sound label in 2012, signing artists like PartyNextDoor.

Other notable contemporary figures include Jared Drake Bell (born June 27, 1986), an American actor and musician best known for starring as Drake Parker on the Nickelodeon sitcom *Drake \u0026 Josh* (2004–2007), which aired over 50 episodes and spawned a soundtrack album that peaked at number 82 on the Billboard 200. Bell began as a child actor in the 1990s, appearing in films like *Highway to Hell* (1991), and released solo music including the album *It's Only Time* (2006). In sports, Drake London (born July 24, 2001) is an American football wide receiver for the Atlanta Falcons, drafted 8th overall in the 2022 NFL Draft after recording 88 receptions for 1,084 yards and seven touchdowns at USC in 2021. Similarly, Drake Maye (born August 30, 2002) is a quarterback for the New England Patriots, selected 3rd overall in the 2024 NFL Draft following a college career at North Carolina where he threw for 7,644 yards and 63 touchdowns over two seasons.

## Fictional characters

### Comics and superheroes

Tim Drake is a key figure in DC Comics' Batman mythos, operating as the third Robin and a highly skilled detective sidekick to Batman. He demonstrated prodigious intellect by deducing Bruce Wayne's identity as Batman through analysis of the Caped Crusader's fighting style and its mimicry by Dick Grayson, the first Robin, leading to his recruitment after Jason Todd's death. Debuting in the late 1980s, Drake underwent rigorous training in martial arts, acrobatics, and investigation, establishing himself as Batman's strategic partner in combating Gotham's criminal underworld.

Following Batman's presumed death in the 2009 *Battle for the Cowl* storyline, Drake adopted the Red Robin mantle to continue vigilantism independently, expanding his role beyond sidekick to leader in teams like the Teen Titans. In the 2022 *Tim Drake: Robin* series, he returns to the Robin identity while using "Drake" as a codename, establishing a marina-based headquarters to probe a year-long mystery involving personal threats and enigmatic adversaries. This iteration emphasizes his self-reliance, technological prowess, and emotional resilience amid family dynamics in the Bat-Family.

Other characters named Drake appear in superhero comics, such as Frank Drake in Marvel's *Tomb of Dracula* saga, a vampire hunter who allies with Blade against undead threats after personal tragedies involving Dracula's minions. Divinity Drake, a Marvel character claiming descent from Dracula, functions as a vampirologist and hunter in supernatural arcs. Carlton Drake, a Marvel antagonist, leads the Life Foundation and engineers symbiote experiments, clashing with Venom and Spider-Man as a corporate villain driven by apocalyptic survivalism.

### Video games and literature

In video games, Nathan Drake serves as the protagonist of Naughty Dog's *Uncharted* series, debuting in *Uncharted: Drake's Fortune*, released on November 20, 2007, for PlayStation 3. Portrayed as a witty, resourceful treasure hunter who claims descent from the historical explorer Sir Francis Drake, the character navigates perilous adventures involving ancient artifacts, combat, and platforming across multiple installments, including *Uncharted 2: Among Thieves* (2009) and *Uncharted 4: A Thief's End* (2016).

Drake is the titular protagonist of *Drake of the 99 Dragons*, a 2003 third-person shooter developed by Idol Minds and published by Majesco for Xbox and other platforms. As an undead assassin from the Hong Kong-based 99 Dragons clan, he wields supernatural dragon chi powers, martial arts, and elemental weapons to avenge his clan's massacre and reclaim the stolen Soul Portal Artifact from the antagonist Tang.

In *Final Fight 3* (1995, Super Nintendo Entertainment System), Drake appears as a boss enemy, depicted as a burly sailor affiliated with criminal elements, who attacks using an anchor as both weapon and grappling tool in beat 'em up combat sequences.

In literature, Paul Drake functions as a key supporting character across Erle Stanley Gardner's Perry Mason detective novels, beginning with *The Case of the Velvet Claws* (1933). A tall, athletic private investigator operating from an office near Mason's, he conducts surveillance, gathers evidence, and engages in physical confrontations, embodying the archetype of the loyal, resourceful operative in legal mysteries.

Temple Drake is the central female protagonist in William Faulkner's *Sanctuary* (1931), a novel exploring Southern Gothic themes of corruption and trauma. Characterized as a slender, red-haired college student from a privileged family—daughter of a judge—she is abducted and victimized by bootleggers and criminals, leading to moral and psychological descent; the character recurs in Faulkner's *Requiem for a Nun* (1951), reflecting on her past experiences.

## Places

### United States

Drake is a city in McHenry County, North Dakota, situated at approximately 47.55°N, 100.23°W. The community had a population of 245 according to 2022 American Community Survey estimates, reflecting a decline from prior years, with a median household income of $46,875 and a poverty rate of 17.6%. Incorporated as a city, it serves as a rural hub in the Minot micropolitan area, primarily supporting agriculture and small-scale local commerce.

Drake, Colorado, is an unincorporated community in Larimer County, positioned along U.S. Highway 34 within Big Thompson Canyon, between Loveland and Estes Park near Rocky Mountain National Park. Known for its scenic canyon setting and outdoor recreation opportunities, including wildlife viewing and access to hiking trails, the area experienced significant flooding in September 2013, which damaged infrastructure and prompted recovery efforts. The community lacks formal municipal governance and relies on Larimer County services for administration.

In Yavapai County, Arizona, Drake was an unincorporated settlement on the Verde River, established in the early 1900s as a railroad work camp for the Santa Fe Railway's Big Hell Canyon Bridge construction. Renamed in 1920 after railroad executive William A. Drake, it briefly prospered as a station on the Phoenix Subdivision before declining into a ghost town by the mid-20th century, with remnants of lime kilns and rail infrastructure. Today, it holds historical interest for its role in early 20th-century rail expansion in the Southwest.

Drakes Bay, a 4-mile-wide inlet along the Pacific coast in Marin County's Point Reyes National Seashore, was named in 1875 by U.S. surveyor George Davidson, commemorating English explorer Sir Francis Drake's purported 1579 anchorage during his circumnavigation voyage. The site features Drakes Beach, backed by sandstone cliffs, and serves as a protected area for marine life, including nurseries for Dungeness crabs and harbor seals, within estuarine marine protected areas. Historical debate persists over whether Drake actually landed here, with some evidence suggesting Nova Albion claims extended to this latitude based on contemporary accounts of the terrain and native interactions.

### Antarctica

The Drake Passage constitutes the principal maritime gateway to Antarctica, linking the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans via the Southern Ocean between Cape Horn at the southern extremity of South America and the South Shetland Islands adjacent to the Antarctic Peninsula. This approximately 850-kilometer-wide waterway, with depths exceeding 2.5 kilometers in sections, formed through tectonic separation of the South American and Antarctic plates, enabling the unimpeded flow of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) that encircles the continent. The passage's establishment, dated to roughly 41 million years ago, isolated Antarctica thermally, fostering extensive ice sheet development and influencing global ocean circulation by directing cold waters northward.

Named for English explorer Sir Francis Drake, the passage derives its designation from his 1578 circumnavigation of the globe, during which a storm propelled his vessel, the *Golden Hind*, southward into high latitudes near 55°S, marking the first European sighting of open waters south of Tierra del Fuego—though Drake did not intentionally traverse the full passage. Earlier potential encounters include Spanish navigator Francisco de Hoces in 1525, prompting alternative nomenclature as *Mar de Hoces* on some charts, while Dutch explorers Willem Schouten and Jacob Le Maire achieved the first documented crossing in 1616 en route to Cape Horn. Historical transits were perilous, exemplified by the 1741 wreck of HMS *Wager* with 120 crew, of whom only 10 survived, and the 1819 sinking of the Spanish vessel *San Telmo* carrying 644 men, whose debris washed ashore in the South Shetland Islands—potentially the first human contact with Antarctica.

The passage's environmental significance lies in channeling the ACC, the world's strongest ocean current, which sustains Antarctica's frigid isolation, supports nutrient upwelling for krill-based ecosystems feeding whales and seals, and acts as a major carbon sink absorbing hundreds of millions of tons of CO₂ annually from the atmosphere. Without land barriers, prevailing westerly winds generate extreme conditions, with waves routinely surpassing 12 meters (40 feet) and storms capable of producing swells over 20 meters (65 feet), contributing to its notoriety as the "Drake Shake" in contrast to occasional calm "Drake Lake" periods. These dynamics have claimed numerous vessels historically and continue to challenge modern shipping, including Antarctic research and tourism expeditions.

Access to Antarctica via the Drake Passage typically involves a 48-hour voyage from Ushuaia, Argentina, aboard expedition ships, exposing passengers to variable seas that test vessel stability and human endurance—though advancements like stabilizers mitigate discomfort. Alternatives include fly-cruise operations bypassing the crossing via short flights to King George Island, reducing exposure to its hazards while preserving access to the continent's coastal regions. Rare feats, such as the 2019 rowing traversal by a six-man team in 13 days, underscore its ongoing role as a proving ground for human and technological limits in polar logistics.

### Australia

Drake is a rural locality within the Tenterfield Shire local government area in New South Wales, positioned approximately 44 kilometres east of Tenterfield on the Bruxner Highway, between the Clarence River and Girard State Forest. The village sits at an elevation of around 500 metres, roughly 800 kilometres north of Sydney, and serves as a small community historically tied to resource extraction.

Gold discovery near Newmans Pinch in 1858 sparked a rush that transformed the area into a bustling mining centre by the 1870s, featuring a shanty village of hotels, boarding houses, churches, timber cottages, and tents amid booming gold and timber operations. Population swelled to thousands during peak activity between 1872 and 1890, supporting 12 pubs and various trades like blacksmithing, before declining as large-scale mining waned, leaving a legacy of alluvial gold dredging from sites like Plumbago Creek starting in 1886.

At the 2021 census, Drake recorded a population of 244 residents, with a median age of 57 years, 56.8% male, and 6.6% identifying as Indigenous, across 103 occupied dwellings averaging 1.8 persons per household and a median weekly income of $698. Contemporary pursuits include bushwalking, horse trail riding, mountain biking, fishing, and licensed gold fossicking for quartz and topaz, alongside amenities such as a caravan park, community centre with art gallery, and the Lunatic Hotel at 7710 Bruxner Highway. The economy centres on cattle grazing and timber, with mining now confined to small-scale fossicking rather than industrial operations.

### Other locations

Named after the 16th-century English explorer Sir Francis Drake—despite his expedition not having navigated it directly—the passage facilitates the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, the world's strongest ocean current, which contributes to its notorious rough conditions, including waves up to 40 feet (12 meters) high and winds exceeding 100 km/h, earning it the moniker "Drake Shake" among mariners. It measures approximately 800 km (500 miles) in length and reaches depths of over 4,800 meters (15,750 feet), playing a critical role in global ocean circulation and climate regulation by isolating Antarctica's cold waters.

**Drake Bay** (Bahía Drake), located on the northern coast of the Osa Peninsula in Puntarenas Province, Costa Rica, spans about 368 km (229 miles) from San José and covers an area known for its high biodiversity, hosting 2.5% of the world's species within Corcovado National Park. The bay, named in association with Sir Francis Drake's 1579 visit during his circumnavigation, features pristine beaches, mangroves, and marine ecosystems supporting activities like snorkeling, kayaking, and whale watching, with humpback whales migrating through from July to October. The main settlement, Agujitas, has a small population and serves as a base for eco-tourism, though access remains challenging via unpaved roads or boat from Sierpe.

**Drake's Island**, a 6.5-acre (2.6-hectare) landmass in Plymouth Sound, lies about 500 meters offshore from Plymouth, Devon, England, and has been fortified since the 16th century for defense against naval threats, including during the Spanish Armada in 1588. Associated with Sir Francis Drake, who reportedly used it as a vantage point, the island features remnants of Palmerston Fort-era batteries built in the 1860s, barracks, and a chapel dating to 1135, with ongoing restoration efforts since its 2019 reopening to visitors for guided tours and events. It supports diverse wildlife, including seabirds, and measures roughly 1,300 feet (400 meters) in length.

In Canada, **Drake** is a small village in the Rural Municipality of Usborne No. 310, Saskatchewan, situated 125 km east of Saskatoon along Highway 20, with a 2016 population of 197 residents primarily engaged in agriculture. Incorporated as a village, it features community facilities like a library and arena, reflecting typical prairie rural life.

## Ships

### Royal Navy vessels

The Royal Navy has named numerous vessels *HMS Drake* in honor of the Elizabethan privateer and explorer Sir Francis Drake (c. 1540–1596).

A 20-gun sloop launched in 1777 was captured intact on 24 April 1778 by the American sloop *USS Ranger* under Lieutenant John Paul Jones during a raid off Carrickfergus, Ireland; the British captain was killed in the engagement, after which the prize was sailed to France by the Americans.

The *HMS Drake*, a 10-gun Cherokee-class brig-sloop launched at Ipswich in 1808, served during the Napoleonic Wars before being wrecked off Newfoundland on 20 June 1822, with significant loss of life among her crew.

The lead ship of the Drake-class armoured cruisers, *HMS Drake* (1901), was laid down on 24 April 1899 and launched on 5 March 1901 at Pembroke Dockyard, with a displacement of 14,100 long tons, length of 500 feet between perpendiculars, and top speed of 23 knots; she was commissioned on 13 January 1903 and assigned to cruiser squadrons for fleet operations and patrols. During the First World War, while escorting a convoy in the North Channel, she was torpedoed amidships by the German U-boat SM *U-79* (under Kapitänleutnant Otto Rohrbeck) on 2 October 1917 north of Rathlin Island, Northern Ireland; the ship caught fire, exploded, and sank after partial beaching, with 18 personnel killed out of her complement.

### Other ships

The schooner *Drake* was a wooden merchant vessel operating in American waters during the late 19th century, in which sea captain James E. Skolfield and his wife Ella owned shares; Ella Skolfield frequently accompanied her husband on its voyages.

## Scientific concepts

### Astrobiology and mathematics

The Drake equation, formulated by American astronomer Frank Drake in 1961, is a probabilistic estimate for the number of active, communicative extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way galaxy. Developed ahead of the first SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) conference at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Green Bank, West Virginia, on November 1, 1961, it served as an agenda-organizing tool to frame discussions on the likelihood of detecting intelligent signals. The equation underscores astrobiology's focus on life's prevalence by multiplying factors related to stellar formation, planetary systems, biological evolution, and technological development, highlighting the chain of rare events required for detectable civilizations.

Mathematically, the equation is \( N = R^* \cdot f_p \cdot n_e \cdot f_l \cdot f_i \cdot f_c \cdot L \), where:
- \( R^* \) is the average rate of star formation in the galaxy, estimated at 1 to 10 stars per year based on observational data from star counts and supernova rates;
- \( f_p \) is the fraction of stars with planetary systems, now known to approach 1 from exoplanet surveys like Kepler;
- \( n_e \) is the average number of planets per star with planets that could support life, typically 0.2 to 1 in habitable zones;
- \( f_l \) is the fraction of such planets where life emerges, unknown and ranging from near 1 (optimistic abiogenesis models) to near 0;
- \( f_i \) is the fraction of life-bearing planets developing intelligent life, highly speculative due to Earth's unique evolutionary history;
- \( f_c \) is the fraction of intelligent civilizations that develop detectable interstellar communication technologies, estimated low given historical technological timelines;
- \( L \) is the average lifespan of such communicating civilizations, potentially 100 to 10,000 years or more, influenced by self-destruction risks or expansion limits.

In astrobiology, the equation informs models of life's universality by integrating empirical stellar and planetary data with biological unknowns, such as the transition from chemical precursors to self-replicating systems. Recent revisions, incorporating data from missions like Kepler and TESS, have refined early terms like \( f_p \) and \( n_e \), yielding estimates of \( N \) from fewer than 1 (implying galactic loneliness) to thousands, depending on optimistic or pessimistic inputs for biological factors. It contrasts with the Fermi paradox, which questions the absence of evidence despite potentially high \( N \), prompting causal analyses of filters like rare eukaryogenesis or civilization collapse.

Critics argue the equation's multiplicative structure amplifies uncertainties in unobservable terms like \( f_l \), \( f_i \), and \( L \), rendering outputs sensitive to assumptions rather than data; for instance, if intelligent life requires improbable steps like multicellularity, \( N \) approaches zero regardless of planetary abundance. Despite this, its value lies in directing research toward testable parameters, such as biosignatures in exoplanet atmospheres via telescopes like the James Webb Space Telescope, rather than yielding precise predictions. Drake himself viewed it as a thought experiment to stimulate inquiry, not a definitive calculation.
