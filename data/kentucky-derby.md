# Kentucky Derby

The **Kentucky Derby** is an annual horse race for three-year-old Thoroughbreds, contested over a distance of 1¼ miles at Churchill Downs racetrack in Louisville, Kentucky, on the first Saturday in May. Established in 1875 by Colonel Meriwether Lewis Clark Jr. through the Louisville Jockey Club, it is the longest continuously running sporting event in the United States and the opening leg of the Triple Crown series, which also includes the Preakness Stakes and Belmont Stakes. Dubbed "the most exciting two minutes in sports," the race draws elite horses qualified through a series of prep events and attracts over 150,000 spectators, making it a cornerstone of American sporting culture.

The Derby's origins trace back to Clark's 1872 trip to Europe, where he was inspired by prestigious races like the Epsom Derby and Grand Prix de Paris, leading him to create a similar event to elevate Thoroughbred racing in the U.S. The inaugural race on May 17, 1875, featured 15 horses with Aristides as the winner, covering the original 1½-mile distance in 2:37.75. In 1896, the distance was shortened to its current 1¼ miles to align with international standards and accommodate faster modern Thoroughbreds. Early prominence grew under promoter Colonel Matt J. Winn starting in 1902, who marketed the event nationally, introduced traditions like the Garland of Roses in 1904 (symbolizing the "Run for the Roses"), and expanded attendance through innovations such as live radio broadcasts in 1925 and television coverage in 1952.

As the first Triple Crown race, the Kentucky Derby sets the stage for historic achievements, with only 13 horses—beginning with Sir Barton in 1919—completing the series by also winning the Preakness and Belmont Stakes. Notable Derby victors include Secretariat, who set the still-standing record time of 1:59.40 in 1973 while en route to a Triple Crown, and fillies like Regret (1915), the first of only three to win the race. The event's cultural hallmarks include the singing of the Stephen Foster anthem "My Old Kentucky Home" as horses parade to the post, the serving of approximately 120,000 mint juleps over Derby weekend, and elaborate fashion displays featuring extravagant hats. With a purse exceeding $5 million as of recent years and a gold trophy presented to the winner since 1924, the Derby remains a global spectacle blending athletic excellence, tradition, and pageantry.

## Overview

### Event Description

The Kentucky Derby is an annual Thoroughbred horse race held on the first Saturday in May at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky, and has been run continuously since its inception in 1875. The event draws competitors and spectators from around the world, establishing it as a cornerstone of American horse racing. It serves as the first leg of the Triple Crown series, which also includes the Preakness Stakes and Belmont Stakes.

The race covers a distance of 1¼ miles (2.0 km), or 10 furlongs, on a dirt track composed primarily of sand, clay, and silt for optimal cushioning and safety. It is restricted to three-year-old Thoroughbred horses, limiting each contender to a single opportunity to compete in the Derby during their career.

The field is capped at 20 horses, determined through a points-based qualification system from a series of designated prep races known as the "Road to the Kentucky Derby." As of 2025, the total purse stands at $5 million, with the winner receiving $3.1 million. The 2025 edition marked the 151st running of the race, won by the horse Sovereignty.

### Significance in Horse Racing

The Kentucky Derby holds a premier position in American horse racing as the first leg of the U.S. Triple Crown series, preceding the Preakness Stakes and Belmont Stakes. Only 13 horses have achieved the rare feat of winning all three races, underscoring the Derby's role in elevating the prestige of Thoroughbred racing. This sequence tests a horse's speed, stamina, and consistency over a grueling five-week period, making a Derby victory a critical benchmark for potential champions.

Nicknamed "The Most Exciting Two Minutes in Sports," the Derby's allure stems from its intense, high-stakes 1¼-mile sprint at Churchill Downs, which typically lasts around two minutes. The average winning time since 2013 has been approximately 2:02.69, with only two horses ever finishing under two minutes flat, heightening the drama of the close finishes and rivalries. This brevity, combined with the field's competitive depth, has cemented its reputation as a pinnacle event in the sport.

As a cultural icon embodying Southern hospitality and elegance, the Derby typically draws around 150,000 attendees to Louisville, with 147,406 in 2025 despite inclement weather, fostering traditions like elaborate hats, mint juleps, and communal celebrations that reflect Kentucky's equestrian heritage. The event generates more than $400 million in economic impact for the region through tourism, wagering, and related spending, with an estimated $441 million for 2025, while attracting a global television audience exceeding 16 million viewers, including 17.7 million for the 2025 broadcast.

The Derby profoundly influences Thoroughbred breeding and training standards, as its winners often become influential sires whose progeny dominate future races and auctions. Kentucky, producing nearly 48% of U.S. Thoroughbred foals as of 2023, leverages the event to spotlight elite bloodlines, driving selective breeding for speed and durability suited to classic distances. This focus elevates industry practices, with Derby success shaping pedigrees that prioritize balanced athleticism for generations.

## Race Details

### Format and Eligibility

The Kentucky Derby is restricted to three-year-old Thoroughbred horses, with no restrictions based on sex, though fillies rarely compete due to the physical demands of racing against colts and geldings. Only three fillies have won the race in its history: Regret in 1915, Genuine Risk in 1980, and Winning Colors in 1988. Colts and geldings carry 126 pounds (57 kg), while fillies carry 121 pounds (55 kg) to account for differences in average size and strength.

Qualification for the Derby occurs through the "Road to the Kentucky Derby" points system, introduced in 2013 to replace the prior earnings-based method and ensure the field consists of the most accomplished contenders. Horses earn points in 36 designated prep races across the United States, Japan, Dubai, and Europe, with the top 20 point-earners (plus up to four also-eligible horses) securing spots in the starting gate. Points are awarded on a scaled basis to the top finishers, such as 100 for the winner of major preps like the Santa Anita Derby, 50 for second, 25 for third, 15 for fourth, and 10 for fifth, though awards can be adjusted downward for races with smaller fields.

The race uses a 20-stall starting gate, with post positions drawn by random lot approximately one week before the event, influencing betting odds and strategies due to historical performance trends. Positions 5 through 10 have produced the most winners since the gate's introduction in 1930, with post 5 leading at a 10.5% win rate, as these spots allow horses to avoid early traffic while maintaining rail access. No pacemaker or pace setter is required, permitting natural race flow determined by jockey tactics.

Stewards oversee the race for compliance with Kentucky Horse Racing Commission rules, reviewing video footage for fouls such as interference or drifting, which can result in disqualification if they alter the finish. Mandatory post-race drug testing applies to the top finishers, screening for prohibited substances under Horseracing Integrity and Safety Authority (HISA) protocols. Following the 2021 disqualification of winner Medina Spirit for a positive betamethasone test—confirmed in 2022—HISA implemented stricter anti-doping measures in 2023, including uniform nationwide testing, banned race-day medications, and enhanced safety rules to prevent performance-enhancing drugs.

### Course and Conditions

The Kentucky Derby is run on the one-mile dirt oval at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky, featuring a main track composed of sandy loam with approximately 82% sand, 16% silt, and 2% clay to provide a consistent surface for Thoroughbred racing. The track measures 80 feet wide, with a stretch from the final turn to the finish line spanning 1,234.5 feet, allowing for high-speed finishes amid the roar of spectators.

Held annually in early May, the track typically presents fast conditions under clear weather, favoring speed and stamina in the 1¼-mile race, though variable Kentucky spring weather can alter this dramatically. For instance, heavy rain in 2018 turned the surface sloppy, impacting strategies and favoring horses adept at mud, as downpours just before post time sealed a messy racing strip after an initial drying period. The race starts from the backstretch via a 7-furlong chute and concludes in front of the grandstand, overlooked by the iconic Twin Spires—twin Gothic towers constructed in 1895 that serve as the track's enduring architectural landmark.

Churchill Downs maintains the track through rigorous daily grooming and periodic upgrades focused on safety and performance, including a major renovation completed in 2005 that modernized facilities around the oval. In 2020, enhancements included a new 20-position starting gate equipped with high-quality foam padding to minimize injury risks during breaks. Prior to each Derby, the surface is meticulously prepared by blending fresh materials and watering to optimize cushioning and traction.

Horses are saddled and paraded in the expansive paddock area adjacent to the grandstand, a tradition that allows fans a close view of the contenders before they proceed to the starting gate. The infield, encompassing the area inside the oval, accommodates general admission crowds with standing-room access, offering an immersive, energetic vantage point for the race though visibility of distant portions can be limited by elevation and crowds.

## History

### Origins and Founding

The Kentucky Derby was founded by Colonel Meriwether Lewis Clark Jr., grandson of explorer William Clark of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, who established the Louisville Jockey Club in 1874 to promote Thoroughbred racing in the United States. Inspired by his travels to Europe, where he observed prestigious events such as England's Epsom Derby and France's Grand Prix de Paris in 1872, Clark sought to create a similar high-profile race on American soil. He acquired land from his uncles, John and Henry Churchill, on the outskirts of Louisville, Kentucky, and developed the racetrack that would become known as Churchill Downs, opening it to the public in 1875.

The inaugural Kentucky Derby took place on May 17, 1875, attracting a crowd of about 10,000 spectators to the new oval track. The race featured fifteen three-year-old Thoroughbreds competing over a distance of 1.5 miles, with Aristides, ridden by jockey Oliver Lewis and trained by Ansel Williamson, emerging victorious by two lengths in a time of 2:37.75. The event offered a total purse of $3,050, with the winner receiving $2,850, a significant sum that underscored the race's ambition to elevate the sport's prestige.

The Derby's establishment aligned with the resurgence of Thoroughbred racing in post-Civil War Kentucky, a state renowned for its fertile bluegrass region that had long supported elite horse breeding since the early 19th century. Despite the economic disruptions of the war, which had scattered breeding stock and temporarily shifted racing prominence to the Northeast, Kentucky's heritage as a hub for producing fast, durable Thoroughbreds—rooted in farms like those in the Lexington area—provided a strong foundation for Clark's vision. This timing capitalized on the state's recovering equine industry, positioning the Derby as a symbol of regional revival and national sporting aspiration.

In its early years, the Derby faced significant financial challenges, particularly in the 1890s when Churchill Downs struggled with mounting debts and inconsistent attendance beyond the annual event. The track was nearly bankrupt by 1902, when Louisville businessman Colonel Matt J. Winn assembled a syndicate to purchase and revitalize it, introducing innovative promotion and marketing that stabilized operations and boosted the Derby's profile. Additionally, in response to concerns that the original 1.5-mile distance was overly taxing for young horses, the race was shortened to 1.25 miles starting in 1896, a change that has remained standard.

### Key Developments and Milestones

In the early 20th century, the Kentucky Derby faced challenges from anti-gambling legislation, but the introduction of pari-mutuel betting machines at Churchill Downs in 1908 revitalized the event by providing a more transparent wagering system that restored public confidence and boosted attendance. This innovation, legalized in Kentucky, marked a pivotal shift that helped sustain the race amid nationwide track closures.

A landmark achievement came in 1919 when Sir Barton became the first horse to win the Triple Crown, sweeping the Kentucky Derby, Preakness Stakes, and Belmont Stakes—though the series was not formally recognized as such until later. Ridden by Johnny Loftus, Sir Barton's Derby victory by five lengths highlighted the growing prestige of the American classics.

The Derby's national profile expanded dramatically in 1952 with its first live television broadcast on CBS, reaching an estimated 10 to 15 million viewers across 44 stations and transforming the event into a major media spectacle. This coverage, originating from Churchill Downs, set the stage for the race's evolution into a broadcast tradition that endures today.

Inclusivity milestones reflect ongoing efforts to broaden participation. African American jockeys, who won 15 of the first 28 Derbies, have not secured a victory since Jimmy Winkfield in 1902, a gap that persists as of 2025 despite increased diversity initiatives in racing. Women broke barriers starting with Diane Crump, the first female jockey to compete in the Derby in 1970 aboard Fuscus, finishing 14th; Patricia Cooksey followed in 1984 as the second woman to ride, aboard So Vague and finishing 11th. These rides underscored the challenges and progress for underrepresented groups in a traditionally male-dominated sport.

Attendance surged in the modern era, reaching a record 170,513 in 2015, the highest in Derby history, reflecting the event's cultural draw before pandemic disruptions. The 2016 edition drew 167,227 fans, the second-largest crowd, further cementing the Derby's status as a premier sporting gathering.

The 2019 race sparked controversy when Maximum Security, the apparent winner, was disqualified for interference after a 22-minute steward review, elevating Country House to victor in the first such on-track DQ in Derby history. Compounding the scandal, federal investigations later revealed that Maximum Security's trainer, Jason Servis, administered performance-enhancing drugs to the horse as part of a broader doping scheme in racing.

The COVID-19 pandemic profoundly altered the Derby in 2020, postponing the race from May to September 5 and running it without spectators for the first time, amid health restrictions that limited access to essential personnel only. The 2021 edition returned to its traditional May 1 date but with limited capacity due to ongoing protocols, drawing 51,838 attendees—the largest U.S. sporting crowd since the pandemic began.

### Attendance and Economic Impact

The Kentucky Derby has experienced significant growth in attendance since its inception, drawing an estimated 10,000 spectators to the inaugural running in 1875 at Churchill Downs. By 2025, the event attracted 147,406 attendees despite inclement weather, reflecting its enduring appeal as one of the world's largest single-day sporting events. Much of this crowd is driven by the vibrant infield parties, where general admission ticket holders gather for a festive atmosphere featuring music, food, and informal viewing of the race, often comprising a substantial portion of the total turnout.

Sponsorships have evolved to enhance the Derby's prestige and funding, with Longines serving as the official timekeeper and watch since 2011, providing elegant timepieces to winners and integrating its brand into race-day ceremonies. TwinSpires, Churchill Downs Incorporated's online betting platform, has maintained longstanding ties as the official wagering partner, facilitating record-breaking handle totals and digital engagement.

The Derby exerts a profound economic influence on Louisville and Kentucky, generating an estimated $396 million in direct, indirect, and induced spending during the 2023 event through visitor expenditures on lodging, dining, and transportation. This impact rose to approximately $441 million in 2025, underscoring the race's role in stimulating local commerce and supporting over 10,000 jobs in hospitality, retail, and related sectors during Derby Week.

Derby Week events significantly boost tourism, attracting international visitors from countries including Ireland, Japan, and the United Kingdom, who contribute to a surge in arrivals at Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport exceeding 33,000 for the weekend. Hotel occupancy in Louisville reaches around 95% during this period, with rates nearing capacity across the region and spillover benefits to nearby areas like southern Indiana.

The COVID-19 pandemic posed challenges, with the 2020 Derby ultimately held without spectators due to rising COVID-19 cases, a sharp decline from pre-pandemic norms. Recovery began in 2022, when full capacity returned and attendance rebounded to 147,294, signaling a return to pre-pandemic vibrancy.

## Traditions and Culture

### Pre-Race Ceremonies

The pre-race ceremonies for the Kentucky Derby build anticipation and honor the event's traditions, unfolding in a structured sequence leading up to the 6:57 p.m. ET post time. These rituals emphasize respect for the horses, jockeys, and the sport's heritage, creating a solemn yet celebratory atmosphere at Churchill Downs.

One of the initial highlights is the performance of "The Star-Spangled Banner," typically sung by a prominent artist about an hour and a half before the race to unite the crowd in national pride. In 2025, Grammy-nominated singer-songwriter Grace Potter delivered an a cappella rendition, continuing a line of celebrity performers that includes Wynonna Judd in 2024 and Harry Connick Jr. in 2017.

Approximately 10 to 20 minutes before post time, the "Riders Up!" command signals jockeys to mount their horses in the paddock, marking the transition from preparation to competition and heightening the tension for spectators. This ceremonial call, broadcast live on NBC, has been delivered by celebrities since 2012; in 2025, Olympic gymnast Simone Biles issued the command at around 6:46 p.m. ET, underscoring the event's blend of sports and star power.

Following the jockeys' mounting, the post parade commences as the 20 competing horses are led from the paddock around the track to the starting gate, allowing fans a close view while escort bands provide musical accompaniment. The University of Louisville Cardinal Marching Band, the official band since 1936, leads this procession, playing lively tunes to energize the 150,000-plus attendees.

As the horses enter the track during the post parade, official bugler Steve Buttleman sounds a trumpet rendition of "My Old Kentucky Home," a tradition he has upheld since becoming Churchill Downs' bugler in 1995, evoking Kentucky's cultural roots and signaling the race's imminent start. This instrumental call to the post, lasting about 15 seconds, is performed before every race but holds special resonance at the Derby, where the crowd often joins in silently or with modified lyrics to reflect the state's heritage.

A pre-race invocation prayer is also recited, often focusing on safety for the horses and riders amid the high-stakes environment, reflecting the community's concern for welfare in the sport. Delivered by a local clergy member or chaplain, this moment of reflection underscores the event's values of integrity and protection, with phrases like "Let's just get 'em all around there safely" echoing among participants and fans.

### Festival and Social Events

The Kentucky Derby Festival, launched in 1956, transforms the two weeks leading up to the race into a citywide celebration with over 70 events that highlight Louisville's community spirit and equestrian heritage. Organized by the Kentucky Derby Festival Foundation, it draws more than 1.5 million attendees annually and features a diverse array of activities, from athletic competitions to cultural showcases. In 2025, historic flooding and severe weather led to the cancellation of some events, including Thunder Over Louisville and the Great Balloon Race, though the festival proceeded with adaptations.

Signature events include Thunder Over Louisville, North America's largest annual fireworks extravaganza, which typically kicks off the festival two weeks before Derby Day and captivates around 500,000 spectators with synchronized displays over the Ohio River; however, it was canceled in 2025 due to historic flooding. The festival also encompasses the Rodes RTZ Half Marathon, one of the nation's premier road races, attracting thousands of runners through scenic urban routes. These gatherings foster a vibrant social atmosphere, blending excitement with local traditions.

On race day, the infield at Churchill Downs serves as the epicenter of casual revelry, where general admission ticket holders spread picnics, tailgate with coolers, and immerse themselves in a rowdy, communal party vibe that contrasts the trackside formality. Live entertainment enhances the experience, with performances on dedicated stages; for instance, in 2022, Nathaniel Rateliff \u0026 The Night Sweats provided an afternoon concert during Thurby festivities in the infield. This area embodies the Derby's inclusive social energy, allowing attendees to relax on the grass while watching races on large screens.

Fashion plays a central role in the Derby's social allure, with "Derby attire" elevating the event into a showcase of Southern elegance and creativity. Women don elaborate hats—from wide-brimmed sun hats to ornate fascinators—while men favor lightweight seersucker suits, pastel shirts, and bow ties, creating a sea of pastels and patterns that has defined the occasion since its early days. This sartorial tradition encourages self-expression and photography, turning the grounds into an impromptu runway.

For high-profile guests, VIP areas like Millionaires Row in the clubhouse offer luxurious boxed seating with panoramic track views, gourmet dining, and private lounges, providing an intimate escape amid the crowds. These premium experiences often attract celebrities, amplifying the event's glamour; notable examples include Martha Stewart, who served as grand marshal in 2024, delivering the "Riders Up!" call to start the race. Such sightings add to the electric, star-studded ambiance for elite attendees.

Family-oriented highlights within the festival ensure broad appeal, such as the Pegasus Parade, a procession down Broadway featuring colorful floats, marching bands, equestrian units, and giant inflatables that celebrate Kentucky's horse culture. Complementing this, the Great BalloonFest typically offers kid-friendly spectacles like hot air balloon races and evening glows at Bowman Field, where tethered balloons illuminate the night sky with burner flares, drawing families for a magical pre-Derby outing, though the 2025 race was canceled due to inclement weather.

### Iconic Symbols and Customs

The Kentucky Derby, often called the "Run for the Roses," culminates with the presentation of a garland of roses to the winning horse, a tradition that began in 1896 when Ben Brush received the first floral tribute after his victory. The nickname "Run for the Roses" was coined in 1925 by New York sports columnist Bill Corum, inspired by the race's floral award and its prestige. Today's garland features over 400 "Freedom" roses hand-sewn onto a green satin backing measuring 122 inches long and 22 inches wide, weighing approximately 40 pounds; the roses symbolize victory, endurance, and renewal of life, with a central "crown" rose honoring the struggle to reach the winner's circle. Crafted annually by local florists in partnership with Kroger since 1987, the garland is draped over the victor immediately after the race, embodying the event's romantic and triumphant spirit.

The mint julep serves as the official drink of the Kentucky Derby, a custom dating to the 1930s when it became a staple at Churchill Downs. This refreshing cocktail combines 2 ounces of Old Forester Bourbon—the presenting sponsor's bourbon—with a tablespoon of mint simple syrup (made by boiling 2 cups each of sugar and water, then infusing with fresh mint overnight) and crushed ice, stirred in a silver cup or glass and garnished with a mint sprig to create a frosted exterior. Over the Kentucky Oaks and Derby weekend, approximately 127,000 mint juleps are served, requiring more than 10,000 bottles of bourbon, 2,250 pounds of freshly harvested mint from Kentucky farms, and 475,000 pounds of ice. They are presented in distinctive souvenir glasses or commemorative 1-liter bottles featuring horse-themed designs, enhancing the drink's role as a collectible memento of the festivities.

As the horses parade to the post, the crowd joins in singing "My Old Kentucky Home, Good-Night!," Stephen Foster's 1853 ballad that has been a Derby staple since at least 1921, with the University of Louisville Marching Band leading the performance of the first verse and chorus since 1936. The song, originally titled "Poor Uncle Tom, Good-Night!" and inspired by Harriet Beecher Stowe's *Uncle Tom's Cabin*, evokes Kentucky's sentimental heritage and fosters a shared emotional moment among attendees. In 2020, amid discussions of its historical racial implications, Churchill Downs edited the lyrics for inclusivity—replacing the original slur with "the people"—and performed it instrumentally by bugler Steve Buttleman, preceded by a moment of silence for reflection on justice; the revised version has continued in subsequent years to align with modern values while preserving the tradition.

In the winner's circle—a hallowed, landscaped area established in 1938—the garland is draped over the winning horse amid celebrations, a practice formalized with floral arrangements since 1944 to frame photographs of the victors. The Governor of Kentucky presents the ornate silver trophy to the winning owner on the nearby Presentation Stand, a ritual underscoring the race's statewide significance and dating to the event's early years. This ceremony, held shortly after the finish around 7 p.m. EDT, captures the joy of triumph with the horse, jockey, trainer, and connections gathered beneath the Twin Spires.

Betting at the Derby incorporates superstitious customs among fans, who often carry lucky charms adorned with bluegrass motifs, horseshoes, or thoroughbred silhouettes to invoke good fortune in their wagers. Common practices include concealing racing programs from others to avoid jinxing selections and drawing on personal talismans tied to Kentucky's bluegrass heritage, enhancing the ritualistic excitement of placing bets on win, place, show, or exotic parlays. These elements blend the thrill of pari-mutuel wagering with folklore, making the pre-race atmosphere as storied as the competition itself.

## Records and Statistics

### Horse Performance Records

The Kentucky Derby, contested over 1¼ miles at Churchill Downs, has produced several enduring performance benchmarks for horses, particularly in terms of speed and victory margins. The fastest winning time remains Secretariat's 1:59.40 in 1973, a track record that has stood unchallenged for over five decades despite advancements in breeding and training. This performance not only secured Secretariat's first Triple Crown leg but also highlighted his exceptional acceleration, as he surged from last to first in the stretch.

Victory margins in the Derby underscore dramatic displays of dominance, with the largest recorded at eight lengths, achieved by four horses across the race's history. Old Rosebud claimed the widest triumph in 1914, pulling away decisively on a muddy track to win by eight lengths over Hodge. Johnstown matched this feat in 1939, followed by Whirlaway in 1941 and Assault in 1946, each demonstrating superior stamina in their respective editions. These blowouts represent rare instances of overwhelming superiority in a typically competitive field.

As a race restricted to three-year-old Thoroughbreds, no horse has ever competed in the Kentucky Derby more than once, limiting opportunities for repeat equine feats. Among underdog stories, Donerail's 1913 victory at 91-1 odds stands as the longest for any winner, a testament to the race's unpredictability despite favoring well-bred favorites. Fillies have proven exceptionally rare victors, with only three successes: Regret in 1915, Genuine Risk in 1980, and Winning Colors in 1988, each overcoming a male-dominated field.

In more recent history, Sovereignty captured the 2025 edition at 7-1 odds, completing the distance in 2:02.31 on a sloppy track to edge out the competition in a tactical finish. This performance added to the Derby's legacy of balanced equine excellence, where speed and resilience continue to define standout achievements.

### Jockey, Trainer, and Owner Records

The Kentucky Derby has seen remarkable achievements by jockeys, with Eddie Arcaro and Bill Hartack sharing the record for most victories at five each; Arcaro won in 1938, 1941, 1942, 1948, and 1952, while Hartack triumphed in 1957, 1960, 1964, 1969, and 1972. Other jockeys with three wins include Calvin Borel (2007, 2009, 2010), Kent Desormeaux (1998, 2000, 2008), Angel Cordero Jr. (1974, 1976, 1985), Gary Stevens (1988, 1995, 1997), and Eddie Delahoussaye (1982, 1983, 1987). In the 2025 Derby, Junior Alvarado secured his first victory aboard Sovereignty, marking a career highlight for the Venezuelan rider who had previously competed in 13 Derbies without a win. 

Historically, African American jockeys dominated the early years of the race, winning 15 of the first 28 Derbies from 1875 to 1902, with Isaac Murphy achieving three victories (1884 Buchanan, 1890 Riley, 1891 Kingman) and becoming the first to win consecutive editions in 1890-1891; Jimmy Winkfield was the last Black jockey to win, taking the 1901 and 1902 races aboard His Eminence and Alan-a-Dale, respectively, before segregation effectively barred them from major tracks.  

Trainers hold impressive records as well, led by Ben A. Jones and Bob Baffert, each with six wins; Jones' triumphs spanned 1938-1952 with Lawrin, Whirlaway, Pensive, Citation, Ponder, and Hill Gail, while Baffert's include Silver Charm (1997), Real Quiet (1998), War Emblem (2002), American Pharoah (2015), Justify (2018), and Authentic (2020).  

D. Wayne Lukas follows with four victories (1988 Winning Colors, 1995 Thunder Gulch, 1996 Grindstone, 1999 Charismatic), the last in 1999. 

Bill Mott earned his second Derby win in 2025 with Sovereignty, following his 2019 success with Country House, which was awarded the victory after Maximum Security's disqualification.  

Notable streaks include back-to-back wins by six trainers, including Ben A. Jones in 1948 and 1949 with Citation and Ponder.   No trainer has secured three consecutive victories. 

Women have made strides in training, with Mary Hirsch becoming the first female trainer to enter a horse in 1937 (No Sir), though no woman has yet won the Derby as of 2025; more recent entries include Vicki Oliver in 2021 (known Agenda) and earlier Carla Gaines in 2015 (Bolo).  

Owners' records are topped by Calumet Farm with eight wins (1941 Whirlaway, 1944 Pensive, 1948 Citation, 1949 Ponder, 1952 Hill Gail, 1957 Iron Liege, 1958 Tim Tam, 1968 Forward Pass), including two pairs of consecutive victories (1948-1949 and 1957-1958).  

Edward R. Bradley follows with four (1921 Behave Yourself, 1926 Bubbling Over, 1932 Burgoo King, 1933 Brokers Tip). 

Godolphin claimed its first Derby in 2025 with Sovereignty, a milestone for the global operation founded by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum.

### Betting and Combined Achievements

The Kentucky Derby is renowned for its substantial betting activity, with wagering handles consistently setting records due to its status as a premier sporting event. In 2025, all-sources wagering on the Derby race alone reached a record $234.4 million, surpassing the previous high of $210.7 million from 2024. Overall Derby Day wagering hit $349 million, up from $320.5 million the prior year. These figures reflect the event's growing popularity, driven by advance-deposit wagering platforms and global interest.

Among the most notable betting outcomes are the high payouts from longshot winners, which highlight the race's unpredictability. The highest $2 win mutuel in Derby history was $184.90, paid on Donerail in 1913 at odds of 91-1, the longest ever for a winner. More recently, the 2025 winner Sovereignty returned $17.96 for a $2 win bet at 7-1 odds. Exotic wagers have also produced massive payouts; for instance, the $1 superfecta in 2005 returned $9,814.80 on Giacomo's victory, while the 2022 superfecta on Rich Strike paid $14,870.70.

No horse has ever won the Kentucky Derby twice, as the race is restricted to three-year-olds, limiting each contender to a single opportunity. Combined achievements add another layer of prestige, particularly the rare Oaks/Derby Double, where connections secure victories in both the Kentucky Oaks (for fillies) and the Derby in the same year. This feat was first accomplished by filly Regret in 1915, who swept both races; subsequent doubles have been rarer, often involving the same owner or trainer with different horses, as seen with Godolphin's 2025 success using Good Cheer in the Oaks and Sovereignty in the Derby.

The Derby also serves as the first leg of the Triple Crown, with 13 horses achieving the full series—Sir Barton (1919) to Justify (2018)—but many more falling short after strong starts. Near-misses, such as California Chrome's 2014 win followed by a second-place Preakness finish, underscore the challenge of the subsequent races. These pursuits amplify betting interest, with futures markets and multi-leg wagers drawing significant volume.

### Chronological List of Winners

The Kentucky Derby, first run on May 17, 1875, at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky, has crowned 151 winners through 2025. The race is contested over 1 + 1⁄4 miles (2.0 km) on dirt, with times recorded in fifths of a second until 1925 and hundredths thereafter. The following table lists all winners chronologically, including the horse, jockey, trainer, winning time, and margin of victory. Special notations include * for fillies and † for winners promoted due to disqualification of the original finisher. Data is sourced from official Churchill Downs records.

### Notable Horses and Their Legacies

Secretariat's 1973 Kentucky Derby victory established him as one of the most dominant horses in racing history, as he completed the 1¼-mile race in a track record time of 1:59 2/5 seconds that still stands today. Under jockey Ron Turcotte and trainer Lucien Laurin, he went on to sweep the Preakness Stakes and Belmont Stakes, securing the ninth Triple Crown and earning $1,316,808 in his career. His extraordinary performances, marked by accelerating speed in the final stretches, transformed him into a cultural icon, inspiring the 2010 Disney film *Secretariat* that highlighted his inspirational story and impact on American sports fandom.

Citation's 1948 triumph in the Kentucky Derby propelled him to become the eighth Triple Crown winner, with victories in the Preakness and Belmont Stakes that showcased his versatility across distances. Bred and owned by Calumet Farm, he achieved a remarkable 16-race winning streak and retired as the first thoroughbred to surpass $1 million in career earnings, totaling $1,085,760 from 45 starts. This financial milestone elevated the sport's prestige, influencing the growth of purses in major races and setting a benchmark for equine economic value that shaped modern Thoroughbred racing economics.

Seattle Slew's undefeated 1977 season culminated in the tenth Triple Crown, including a Kentucky Derby win by 1¾ lengths under jockey Jean Cruguet, making him the first horse to achieve the feat without a prior loss. Purchased for just $17,500 as a yearling, his nine-race perfect record earned him Horse of the Year honors and sparked "Slewmania" among fans. At stud, he sired champions like A.P. Indy, contributing to a lasting legacy in breeding that produced multiple stakes winners and reinforced his status as a cornerstone of American bloodlines.

American Pharoah's 2015 Kentucky Derby victory by a length over Firing Line marked the beginning of his sweep of the Triple Crown races, ending a 37-year drought since Affirmed in 1978. Trained by Bob Baffert and ridden by Victor Espinoza, he won the Preakness and Belmont Stakes in dominant fashion, becoming the first horse to add the Breeders' Cup Classic to the Triple Crown and earning $8,650,300 overall. His achievement revitalized interest in the sport, drawing record viewership and underscoring the rarity of Triple Crown success in an era of increased competition.

Sovereignty's 2025 Kentucky Derby win represented a historic milestone for owner Godolphin, as the homebred colt outfinished favorite Journalism by 1½ lengths on a sloppy track at Churchill Downs. Trained by Bill Mott and ridden by Junior Alvarado, this victory marked Godolphin's first in the race after 12 prior attempts, solidifying the operation's growing influence in American racing. The $5 million purse win highlighted Sovereignty's potential as a cornerstone for Godolphin's North American program, which led 2025 ownership earnings at $5.32 million entering the race.

Fillies have rarely conquered the Kentucky Derby, but Regret's 1915 victory as the first of her sex set a precedent for female excellence in the sport. Owned by Harry Payne Whitney and trained by James Rowe Sr., the 2-year-old filly led wire-to-wire, defeating 17 colts and earning retrospective American Horse of the Year honors for her undefeated juvenile season. Her success elevated the Derby's status as a premier event and inspired future generations of fillies to compete against males.

Genuine Risk's 1980 Derby win made her only the second filly to claim the title, surging to a 1½-length victory over Temperence Hill under jockey Jacinto Vasquez. She finished second in the Preakness and third in the Belmont, becoming the first filly to hit the board in all three Triple Crown races. Post-racing, her breeding career faced significant challenges, including multiple failed pregnancies and a controversial 1985 mating with Roberto that produced a healthy filly, though she ultimately delivered just one foal, Genuine Reward, in 1993 after years of difficulty. These struggles highlighted the physiological hurdles for elite fillies in producing offspring, yet her racing achievements remain a benchmark for female Thoroughbreds.

### Breeding Lines and Sire Influence

The Thoroughbred horse breed originates from three Oriental foundation sires imported to England in the late 17th and early 18th centuries: the Darley Arabian (c. 1700), the Byerley Turk (c. 1680), and the Godolphin Arabian (c. 1724). These sires form the basis of all modern Thoroughbred pedigrees through their male lines, with the Kentucky Derby reflecting this genetic foundation in its winners' lineages.

The Darley Arabian sire line has dominated the Kentucky Derby, producing the vast majority of winners across the race's history. From 1921 to 2020, for instance, nearly all 100 Derby winners traced their male-line descent to the Darley Arabian through branches like Phalaris (via Pharos) or Nearco (via Hyperion). This dominance stems from influential descendants such as Northern Dancer (1964 Derby winner), whose male line has yielded multiple subsequent victors, including Street Sense in 2007 via the Sadler's Wells branch. The line's prevalence underscores its role in propagating speed and stamina suited to the Derby's demands.

In contrast, the Byerley Turk sire line has contributed fewer Derby winners, with 11 recorded through branches like Herod and Vandal. A notable early example is Aristides, the inaugural 1875 Derby winner, whose pedigree traces via Leamington to the Faugh-a-Ballagh line descending from the Byerley Turk. These victories were concentrated in the 19th and early 20th centuries, reflecting the line's gradual eclipse by the Darley Arabian in American breeding.

The Godolphin Arabian sire line has exerted the least influence on Derby winners, accounting for only four successes: Zev (1923), Flying Ebony (1925), Clyde Van Dusen (1929), and War Admiral (1937). This rarity highlights the line's limited propagation in modern Thoroughbred racing compared to its foundational role.

Several Kentucky Derby winners have perpetuated their bloodlines by siring subsequent Derby champions, demonstrating the race's role in elevating stallions' breeding value. There have been 12 such instances where a Derby winner directly sired another.

| Unbridled (1990)   | Grindstone (1996)            |

Beyond direct sire-offspring pairs, male-line descendants of Derby winners have produced at least 28 additional Derby successes across various branches, amplifying the genetic legacy of standout performers.

Victory in the Kentucky Derby significantly boosts a horse's value as a stallion, often leading to sharp increases in stud fees due to demand from breeders seeking proven racing genetics. For example, 2018 Derby and Triple Crown winner Justify's fee was set at $150,000 for his first season at Ashford Stud in 2019, reflecting his immediate commercial impact. This pattern has shaped the Thoroughbred industry by prioritizing Derby-proven lines in commercial breeding programs.
