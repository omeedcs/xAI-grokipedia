## Overview

Delhi, officially known as the National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi, is the capital of India and one of the largest urban agglomerations in the world. Located in northern India, Delhi serves as the political, cultural, and commercial hub of the country. It encompasses New Delhi, the seat of the Indian government, which was designated as the capital of British India in 1911 and officially inaugurated in 1931. With a population of over 31 million in its metropolitan area as of 2023, Delhi is a melting pot of diverse cultures, languages, and traditions [Census of India](http://censusindia.gov.in/). The city is situated on the banks of the Yamuna River and spans an area of approximately 1,484 square kilometers (573 square miles).

Delhi is renowned for its historical significance, having been a center of power for numerous empires over centuries. Today, it stands as a symbol of India's rapid urbanization and economic growth, while grappling with challenges such as pollution, overpopulation, and infrastructure strain. The city is also a major tourist destination, attracting millions annually to its UNESCO World Heritage Sites and vibrant markets.

## Historical Background

Delhi's history dates back over 2,500 years, with evidence of human settlement as early as the 6th century BCE. It is often associated with the ancient city of Indraprastha, mentioned in the Indian epic *Mahabharata* as the capital of the Pandava kingdom [Archaeological Survey of India](https://asi.nic.in/). Over the centuries, Delhi has been the seat of several powerful dynasties and empires, earning it the nickname "the city of seven cities" due to the successive settlements built and destroyed in the region.

- **Ancient and Medieval Periods**: Delhi emerged as a significant political center under the Tomara dynasty in the 8th century CE. It gained prominence under the Delhi Sultanate (1206–1526), established by Qutb-ud-din Aibak, whose architectural legacy includes the Qutub Minar, a UNESCO World Heritage Site [UNESCO Qutub Minar](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/233/). The city later became the capital of the Mughal Empire (1526–1857), with emperors like Akbar, Shah Jahan, and Aurangzeb leaving indelible marks through monuments such as the Red Fort and Jama Masjid [UNESCO Red Fort](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/231/).
- **Colonial Era**: In 1857, Delhi was a focal point of the Indian Rebellion against British rule. Following the rebellion, the British Crown took direct control, and in 1911, King George V announced the shifting of the capital from Calcutta (now Kolkata) to Delhi. New Delhi was meticulously planned by British architect Sir Edwin Lutyens, featuring wide boulevards, government buildings, and the iconic India Gate [National Portal of India](https://www.india.gov.in/my-government/history).
- **Post-Independence**: After India gained independence in 1947, Delhi became the capital of the new republic. The city saw massive demographic changes due to the Partition of India, with millions of refugees arriving from Pakistan, shaping its cultural fabric [Partition Museum](https://www.partitionmuseum.org/).

## Current Status and Relevance

Delhi holds a unique position as the National Capital Territory, a federally administered region that includes New Delhi, the seat of the Indian government. It is home to the President’s residence (Rashtrapati Bhavan), Parliament House, and the Supreme Court of India. Politically, Delhi operates under a complex governance structure with an elected Legislative Assembly and a Chief Minister, though the central government retains significant control over key functions like law and order [Delhi Government](https://delhi.gov.in/).

Economically, Delhi is a powerhouse, contributing significantly to India's GDP. It hosts major industries, including information technology, telecommunications, and retail, and serves as a key financial center with the presence of the National Stock Exchange (NSE) [NSE India](https://www.nseindia.com/). The city's per capita income is among the highest in India, though stark income inequality persists.

However, Delhi faces pressing challenges. It is infamous for severe air pollution, often ranking among the world's most polluted cities, particularly during winter due to vehicular emissions, industrial activity, and crop burning in neighboring states [World Air Quality Report](https://www.iqair.com/world-air-quality-report). Overpopulation and rapid urbanization have strained infrastructure, leading to issues like traffic congestion, water scarcity, and inadequate housing.
