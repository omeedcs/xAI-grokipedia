# Mike Trout

Michael Nelson Trout (born August 7, 1991) is an American professional baseball outfielder for the Los Angeles Angels of Major League Baseball (MLB).

Selected by the Angels in the first round, 25th overall, of the 2009 MLB Draft out of Millville Senior High School in New Jersey, Trout made his MLB debut on July 8, 2011, and quickly established himself as one of the premier players in the sport.

Over his career through the 2025 season, Trout has compiled a .294 batting average with 404 home runs, 1,018 runs batted in, and 214 stolen bases in 1,648 games, while maintaining an on-base plus slugging percentage (OPS) of .976.

His accolades include three American League (AL) Most Valuable Player (MVP) Awards in 2014, 2016, and 2019; the 2012 AL Rookie of the Year Award; 11 All-Star Game selections, with 10 consecutive starts from 2013 to 2023; nine Silver Slugger Awards; and two All-Star Game MVP honors in 2014 and 2015.

Trout's blend of power, speed, and plate discipline has earned him widespread recognition as one of the greatest all-around hitters of his generation, highlighted by his seven top-five finishes in AL MVP voting across eight full seasons from 2012 to 2019.

Despite these individual accomplishments, the Angels have reached the playoffs only once during Trout's tenure (in 2014), without advancing past the Wild Card Game, and he has battled injuries in recent years, limiting him to 130 games in 2025, during which he hit .232 with 26 home runs and 64 RBIs.

As of November 2025, Trout remains under contract with the Angels through 2030 and is expected to continue his career with the team.

## Early life and amateur career

### Family background and upbringing

Michael Nelson Trout was born on August 7, 1991, in Vineland, New Jersey, to parents Jeff and Debbie Trout. He is the youngest of three children, with an older sister, Teal, and an older brother, Tyler. The family soon relocated to nearby Millville, New Jersey, where Trout spent his childhood in a working-class community known for its blue-collar roots and limited year-round access to baseball due to cold winters.

Trout grew up in a sports-oriented household that emphasized athletic participation and personal values like respect and humility. His mother, Debbie, a preschool teacher and former swimmer and softball player, came from a family of five football-playing brothers, contributing to the athletic environment. His father, Jeff, played college baseball at the University of Delaware, where he hit .398 over four seasons, and was drafted by the Minnesota Twins in the fifth round of 1983, spending four years in their minor league system as a second baseman before injuries, including a torn plantar fascia and knee issues, ended his career at age 25. Jeff later became a history teacher and coach for baseball and football at Millville High School, where he instilled discipline and a focus on being a "good person" as the family's top priority.

From a young age, Trout's interest in baseball was nurtured through family involvement and local opportunities, with his father providing guidance without excessive pressure. Jeff would play catch or hit with Mike whenever he wanted but avoided initiating sessions, allowing his son to develop organically. By age 5, Trout was playing T-ball, progressing to Little League and All-Star travel teams, where he often stood out for his speed and hitting ability, such as smashing a long home run at age 10 in a game against older boys. These early experiences in local leagues and backyard games with siblings and father laid the foundation for his passion, though the region's scouting challenges sometimes led to him being underestimated early on.

### High school and draft preparation

Trout attended Millville Senior High School in Millville, New Jersey, where he distinguished himself as a standout baseball player. During his senior year in 2009, he batted .531, hit 18 home runs—a New Jersey high school record—and drove in 45 runs while also contributing on the mound with a 5-1 record and 1.71 ERA. His performance earned him the Gatorade New Jersey Player of the Year award and a spot on the All-State first team.

In addition to baseball, Trout excelled in multiple sports, serving as the starting quarterback on the football team during his sophomore year and playing guard on the basketball team, where he averaged 14.8 points and more than 10 rebounds per game. Despite these accomplishments, he ultimately prioritized baseball, with his family's encouragement playing a key role in his focus on the sport.

As a highly touted prospect, Trout drew interest from several colleges and committed to play baseball at East Carolina University in November 2008. However, his rapid rise in scouting rankings—reaching the top of the high school outfield class by draft time—led him to forgo college and enter the 2009 MLB Draft.

## Professional career

### Draft selection and minor league development

Mike Trout was selected by the Los Angeles Angels with the 25th overall pick in the first round of the 2009 Major League Baseball Draft out of Millville Senior High School in New Jersey, where he had earned All-State honors as a senior. He signed with the Angels for a $1,215,000 signing bonus, forgoing a commitment to play college baseball at East Carolina University.

Trout began his professional career in 2009 with the rookie-level Arizona League Angels, where he posted a .360 batting average with one home run and 13 stolen bases over 39 games, helping the team reach the league playoffs. Late in the season, he made a brief appearance with the Single-A Cedar Rapids Kernels, going 4-for-15 in five games. In just his first year, Trout demonstrated elite speed and contact skills, ranking second in the Arizona League in batting average.

In 2010, Trout advanced to full-season ball, starting with the Single-A Cedar Rapids Kernels of the Midwest League, where he batted .341 with ten home runs and 40 stolen bases in 82 games, earning league MVP honors and the batting title. Promoted midseason to the High-A Rancho Cucamonga Quakes of the California League, he hit .289 with nine home runs and 19 stolen bases in 56 games, showcasing improved power while maintaining his base-stealing prowess. That year, Trout was named the Topps Minor League Player of the Year, becoming the youngest recipient at 19 years old.

Trout's rapid ascent continued in 2011 when he opened the season with the Double-A Arkansas Travelers of the Texas League, slashing .326/.414/.544 with 11 home runs, 13 triples, and 33 stolen bases in 91 games. His performance earned him the Baseball America Minor League Player of the Year Award, highlighting his five-tool potential as a center fielder. On July 8, 2011, the Angels promoted Trout to the major leagues for the first time, marking the end of his minor league development after just two full seasons. Over 279 minor league games across three levels, Trout compiled a .327 batting average, 32 home runs, and 106 stolen bases, establishing himself as one of the top prospects in baseball.
### Los Angeles Angels tenure: Rise to stardom (2011–2016)

Trout's major league career began with the Los Angeles Angels on July 8, 2011, when he was called up from Triple-A Salt Lake after a promising minor league season where he hit .324 with 12 home runs in 97 games across Double-A and Triple-A. In his debut year, he appeared in 40 games, posting a .220 batting average with 5 home runs, 16 RBIs, and 4 stolen bases, while contributing 0.5 WAR as he adjusted to big-league pitching.

The 2012 season marked Trout's explosive breakout, establishing him as one of baseball's elite talents. Playing in 139 games, he slashed .326/.399/.564 with 30 home runs, 83 RBIs, a league-leading 129 runs scored, and 49 stolen bases, generating an unprecedented 10.5 WAR that set a modern rookie record. His performance earned him the American League Rookie of the Year award unanimously, along with his first All-Star selection and a Silver Slugger; he finished second in AL MVP voting behind Miguel Cabrera.

In 2013, Trout continued his ascent, batting .323 with 27 home runs and 97 RBIs over 157 games, while leading the AL with 109 runs and 110 walks, culminating in a 179 OPS+ and 8.9 WAR. Despite these accomplishments, he finished as runner-up in AL MVP voting to Cabrera, who won the Triple Crown. Trout's consistency solidified his reputation as a five-tool superstar, blending power, speed, plate discipline, and defense in center field.

Trout captured his first AL MVP award in 2014 after a 157-game campaign where he hit .287 with 36 home runs, a league-high 111 RBIs, and 16 stolen bases, posting a 169 OPS+ and 7.6 WAR. He also won All-Star Game MVP honors with a 2-for-3 performance including a double, triple, and two RBIs in the AL's victory. That March, Trout signed a six-year, $144.5 million contract extension with the Angels, the richest in franchise history at the time, securing his future with the team through 2020.

The 2015 season saw Trout lead the AL in slugging percentage (.590) and OPS (.991) while batting .299 with 41 home runs and 90 RBIs in 159 games, good for 9.4 WAR and a 176 OPS+ despite dealing with a wrist issue in July that he played through. He earned his second straight All-Star Game MVP with a three-run homer in the first inning, becoming the first player to win consecutive honors. Trout finished second in AL MVP voting to Josh Donaldson.

Trout rounded out this period with his second AL MVP in 2016, slashing .315/.441/.550 with 29 home runs, 100 RBIs, 30 stolen bases, and a league-leading 124 runs in 159 games, producing 10.5 WAR and a 174 OPS+. His .991 OPS ranked second in the AL, but his overall dominance, including leading the majors in walks (116) and on-base percentage (.441), made him the unanimous choice for the award.

### Los Angeles Angels tenure: Sustained excellence (2017–2022)

Following his early-career dominance, which included two American League Most Valuable Player Awards in 2014 and 2016, Mike Trout maintained elite production for the Los Angeles Angels from 2017 to 2022, earning six All-Star selections and three Silver Slugger Awards despite the team's consistent postseason absences. In 2017, Trout batted .306 with 33 home runs and 72 RBIs over 134 games, finishing fourth in AL MVP voting while leading the league in on-base plus slugging (OPS) at 1.088. That September, he hit his 200th career home run against the Seattle Mariners, solidifying his status as one of baseball's premier power hitters.

Trout's 2018 season showcased his offensive prowess, as he posted a .312 average, 39 home runs, and 79 RBIs in 140 games, earning his seventh All-Star nod, second-place MVP finish, and first Silver Slugger of the period. He led the AL in on-base percentage (.464), slugging percentage (.628), and OPS (1.092), contributing to a career-high 129 runs scored amid the Angels' 80-82 finish outside the playoffs. The following year, 2019, marked Trout's third MVP award, as he slashed .291/.458/.645 with 45 home runs and 104 RBIs—pacing the league in home runs, RBIs, on-base percentage, slugging, and OPS—in 134 games, while also securing another Silver Slugger. In March 2019, Trout signed a 12-year, $426.5 million contract extension with the Angels, the richest in MLB history at the time, committing him to the franchise through 2030 with no opt-outs.

The 2020 season, shortened to 60 games by the COVID-19 pandemic, saw Trout hit .281 with 17 home runs and 46 RBIs in 53 games, finishing fifth in MVP voting and winning his sixth Silver Slugger overall. On September 5, he belted his 300th career home run against the Houston Astros, surpassing Tim Salmon to become the Angels' all-time franchise leader. Limited to 36 games in 2021 due to a calf strain, Trout still earned an All-Star selection with a .333 average, eight home runs, and 18 RBIs, demonstrating his per-game impact. In 2022, he rebounded with a .263 average, 40 home runs, and 80 RBIs across 119 games, capturing his eighth All-Star berth, ninth MVP voting appearance (eighth place), and another Silver Slugger while leading the AL in home runs per plate appearance. Throughout this span, the Angels failed to reach the playoffs in any season, finishing with losing records in five of six years.

### Los Angeles Angels tenure: Recent seasons and injuries (2023–2025)

Trout's 2023 season was severely limited by injury, as he appeared in only 82 games for the Angels, batting .263 with 18 home runs and posting an .857 OPS before a fractured left hamate bone in his hand sidelined him starting July 3. The injury required surgery, and although he attempted a rehabilitation assignment in August, complications led to his placement on the 60-day injured list on September 24, effectively ending his year without a return to the lineup.

In 2024, Trout's challenges continued with persistent knee issues, restricting him to just 29 games where he hit .220 with 10 home runs and an .867 OPS. A torn meniscus in his left knee in late April prompted surgery and an initial recovery period, but a second tear discovered via MRI in late July forced him to miss the remainder of the season.

Trout rebounded somewhat in 2025, playing 130 games and batting .232 with 26 home runs, 64 RBIs, and a .798 OPS, though a bone bruise in his left knee in early May caused him to miss 26 games. To preserve his health, the Angels transitioned him primarily to right field and designated hitter roles during the season. Key milestones included reaching his 1,000th career RBI with a home run on July 27 against the Seattle Mariners, hitting his 400th career home run on September 20 versus the Colorado Rockies, and setting a franchise record with his 30th multi-home run game on September 26 against the Houston Astros.

As of the end of the 2025 season, Trout's career totals stood at a .294 batting average, 404 home runs, 1,018 RBIs, 214 stolen bases, and 1,449 games played, all with the Angels. Persistent injuries fueled speculation about his future, including retirement rumors following his July milestone amid ongoing knee concerns, but Trout publicly reaffirmed his commitment to returning in 2026.

## International career

Trout represented the United States in the 2010 COPABE Pan American Games in Puerto Rico, where he started nine games and hit .350 with three home runs and seven RBIs, leading Team USA in runs scored.

### World Baseball Classic appearances

Trout opted out of the 2013 World Baseball Classic and the 2017 edition, citing concerns about the timing with spring training and injury risks ahead of the MLB season.

In 2023, Trout captained Team USA to the World Baseball Classic final, batting .296 with one home run and seven RBIs over six games while contributing key hits in pool and semifinal victories. The team fell short of the title in a 3-2 defeat to Japan, with Trout striking out against teammate Shohei Ohtani for the tournament's final out.

### All-WBC team honors

Trout was selected to the All-World Baseball Classic team as an outfielder following Team USA's runner-up finish in the 2023 tournament, where he captained the squad and delivered a strong overall performance that included a .296 batting average, one home run, and seven RBIs across six games. This honor recognized his contributions to the silver-medal effort, highlighting his status as a key leader and performer on the international stage.

Beyond the World Baseball Classic, Trout's international appearances have primarily been limited to his early career participation in the Pan American Games, with no further major tournaments as of 2025. His role as Team USA captain in 2023 underscored his leadership qualities, as he anchored the lineup and mentored younger players during the event's high-stakes games. This emphasis on guiding the national team reflected Trout's veteran presence and commitment to USA Baseball's success in global competitions.

## Awards and achievements

### Major individual awards

Trout's ascent in Major League Baseball was marked by immediate recognition, beginning with his unanimous selection as the 2012 American League Rookie of the Year by the Baseball Writers' Association of America, an honor that highlighted his seamless transition from the minors to stardom. This early accolade set the stage for a series of prestigious individual awards that affirmed his status as a generational talent.

Throughout his career, Trout has secured the American League Most Valuable Player Award three times—in 2014, 2016, and 2019—placing him among the select few players to achieve multiple MVP honors and underscoring his all-around impact during key phases of his tenure with the Los Angeles Angels. He has also been selected to 11 All-Star Games, spanning 2012 through 2016 and 2018 through 2023, reflecting his sustained elite performance despite periodic injuries, and earned All-Star Game MVP honors twice, in 2014 and 2023. Additionally, Trout has earned nine Silver Slugger Awards, recognizing the top offensive performers at each position as voted by managers and coaches, including three consecutive wins from 2012 to 2014 and further selections in 2015, 2016, 2018, 2019, 2021, and 2022.

In 2014, Trout received the American League Hank Aaron Award, presented annually to the league's top offensive player irrespective of position, further cementing his reputation as a premier hitter during his formative years. He has also been named American League Player of the Month four times (July 2012, June 2014, July 2015, and April 2017), acknowledging his exceptional monthly contributions to the Angels' lineup. Although Trout has not won a Gold Glove Award, his outfield defense has garnered recognition through one Fielding Bible Award in 2012, which honors superior fielding based on comprehensive statistical analysis.

### Statistical milestones and records

Mike Trout has established himself as one of the most productive players in Major League Baseball history through the 2025 season, amassing a career batting average of .294, 404 home runs, 1,018 runs batted in, 1,196 runs scored, 214 stolen bases, and an adjusted on-base plus slugging (OPS+) of 169. His cumulative 87.5 Baseball-Reference Wins Above Replacement (bWAR) underscores his elite value, combining offensive dominance with strong defense and baserunning.

Key milestones highlight Trout's consistency and power. He recorded his 1,000th career hit on August 7, 2017, during a game against the Baltimore Orioles, coinciding with his 26th birthday. His 300th home run came on September 5, 2020, in a doubleheader against the Houston Astros, surpassing Tim Salmon to set the Angels' franchise record at the time. Trout reached the 400th home run milestone on September 20, 2025, with a 485-foot blast at Coors Field against the Colorado Rockies, joining an exclusive club of 59 players in MLB history.

Within the Los Angeles Angels organization, Trout holds several franchise records, including the most career home runs with 404 and the highest on-base percentage at .406.

In advanced metrics, Trout has led the American League in bWAR six times (2012, 2013, 2015, 2016, 2018, and 2019), a testament to his peak performance across multiple seasons. During the 2025 season, he appeared in 130 games, batting .232 with 26 home runs and 64 RBIs, contributing to his ongoing career totals despite injury challenges.

## Player profile

### Offensive capabilities

Mike Trout bats right-handed and is renowned for his elite bat speed, which contributes to his ability to generate exceptional power and contact. His swing mechanics feature a compact load and explosive hip rotation, allowing him to maintain a consistent bat path through the zone. This has been highlighted in analyses of his mechanics, where his average bat speed reaches 74.0 mph, placing him among the league's leaders in rotational velocity.

Trout's career batting average stands at .294, underpinned by strong plate discipline with a 23.1% strikeout rate and a 14.8% walk rate, enabling him to work deep counts and capitalize on pitches in the strike zone. As a power hitter, he has amassed 404 home runs over his career, many of which are pulled to left field due to his pull-heavy approach that leverages his bat speed for fly-ball contact. He has historically excelled against left-handed pitchers, posting a .282 batting average and 79 home runs in 1,826 plate appearances against them. In 2025, his offensive output included an average exit velocity of 90.9 mph and a 15.8% barrel rate, metrics that underscore his continued ability to drive the ball with authority despite injury challenges.

Trout embodies a rare speed-power combination, with 214 career stolen bases complementing his slugging prowess; he led the American League in total bases four times (2012, 2013, 2014, and 2016). To counter defensive shifts, he has adapted by incorporating opposite-field hitting, spraying line drives to right field and maintaining a balanced spray chart that prevents predictability. This versatility has sustained his on-base percentage at .406 career-wide, making him a perennial threat at the plate.

### Defensive skills and versatility

Mike Trout established himself as a premier center fielder early in his career, showcasing exceptional range and instincts that contributed significantly to his defensive value. Advanced metrics highlighted his Gold Glove-caliber play, with a Defensive Runs Saved (DRS) rating of +19 in his 2012 rookie season, placing him among the league leaders in outfield defense. Despite these strong performances, Trout never won a Gold Glove Award, partly due to the competitive era and the subjective nature of the voting process, though his overall career Defensive WAR (dWAR) stands at 2.2, reflecting consistent above-average contributions in the outfield.

Trout's arm strength has been a standout feature of his defensive profile, enabling him to accumulate notable outfield assists throughout his career. In his breakout 2012 season, he recorded 3 assists while patrolling center field, demonstrating his ability to gun down baserunners with accurate throws. His arm continued to shine in later years, averaging 6.5 assists per season from 2015 to 2018, underscoring his reputation as one of the American League's most feared outfield arms during his prime.

In 2025, Trout transitioned to right field for the Los Angeles Angels, a strategic move aimed at preserving his legs and reducing physical wear amid ongoing injury concerns. The shift allowed him to leverage his experience while adapting to fewer demands on his speed, resulting in a solid performance with 0 errors across 22 games in the position early in the season. This change marked a versatile evolution in his role, helping him stay on the field longer despite playing in only a limited number of games that year.

Beyond stationary defense, Trout's baserunning prowess added to his all-around skill set, with 214 career stolen bases achieved at an impressive 84.9% success rate. This efficiency, particularly evident in his early seasons where he led the league with 49 steals in 2012, highlighted his speed and baseball IQ on the basepaths.

## Personal life

### Family and residences

Mike Trout married his high school sweetheart, Jessica Cox, on December 16, 2017, in an intimate ceremony in Oahu, Hawaii. The couple, who first dated briefly during their time at Millville Senior High School in New Jersey, rekindled their relationship in 2006 and have maintained a close partnership throughout Trout's professional career. They welcomed their first son, Beckham Aaron Trout, on July 30, 2020, and their second son, Jordy Michael Trout, on June 30, 2024.

Trout and his family reside in a 9,000-square-foot English Tudor-style mansion in the gated Harbor Ridge community of Newport Beach, California, which he purchased for $9.15 million in 2019. The home features six bedrooms, ocean views, and amenities suited to family life, including a swimming pool and game room. Despite his West Coast base, Trout maintains strong ties to his hometown of Millville, New Jersey, where he grew up and where his extended family remains. His wife and children frequently attend his games at Angel Stadium, providing support during the season.

### Philanthropy and endorsements

Mike Trout has engaged extensively in philanthropy, emphasizing support for youth mentorship, children's health, and mental wellness. In 2016, he became an ambassador for Big Brothers Big Sisters of Orange County and the Inland Empire, leveraging his platform to recruit volunteers and advocate for mentoring programs that pair children facing adversity with adult role models. Through partnerships with the Make-A-Wish Foundation and the Angels Baseball Foundation, Trout has granted numerous wishes for children with serious illnesses, including playing catch with a 15-year-old brain tumor patient and hosting a birthday party for a 17-year-old battling cancer. He frequently visits children's hospitals, such as Miller Children's \u0026 Women's Hospital in Long Beach, where he interacts with patients, including those in neonatal intensive care units, to provide encouragement and joy.

Following the 2018 suicide of his brother-in-law, Aaron Cox, Trout and his wife Jessica launched the "Your Game Isn't Over Yet" apparel line in collaboration with Tiny Turnip, featuring designs like a semicolon baseball and a home plate inscribed with names of suicide victims; all proceeds support the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention (AFSP). In 2023, Trout was appointed an MLB Mental Wellness Ambassador under the MLB Together initiative, promoting mental health resources and societal contributions through baseball. His efforts earned him the Los Angeles Angels' nomination for the 2024 Roberto Clemente Award, which recognizes MLB players for extraordinary community impact; Trout selected JR98, a youth mental health and suicide prevention organization, to receive the associated MLB Charities donation. Trout has also supported disaster relief via the Red Cross and local causes in his native New Jersey, including a 2020 donation feeding 90 grocery store workers in the Millville-Vineland area during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Trout's endorsement deals have significantly bolstered his financial profile, with major partnerships including Nike for apparel and footwear, Rawlings for gloves and protective gear, and Topps for trading cards and memorabilia. These agreements, along with others like Six Star Pro Nutrition and Fanatics, generate an estimated $4 million annually through commercials, product lines, and promotional appearances. Trout has been selective about endorsements, often declining opportunities to maintain privacy and focus on authentic alignments, a stance praised by the Angels organization as exemplifying his role as an "exceptional ambassador for the game."

As of 2025, Trout's net worth stands at approximately $140 million, accrued largely from his 12-year, $426.5 million contract with the Angels—signed in 2019 and including a $20 million signing bonus—and his endorsement portfolio.
