# Joan of Arc

## Introduction

Joan of Arc, also known as Jeanne d'Arc or the Maid of Orléans, was a French peasant girl who became a national heroine and Catholic saint due to her role in the Hundred Years' War between France and England. Born around 1412 in Domrémy, France, Joan claimed to have received divine visions instructing her to support Charles VII and help reclaim French territory from English control. Her military leadership and unyielding faith inspired French troops, leading to key victories such as the lifting of the Siege of Orléans in 1429. Captured by the English in 1430, she was tried for heresy and witchcraft, and ultimately burned at the stake in 1431 at the age of 19. Canonized in 1920, Joan of Arc remains a symbol of courage, faith, and French national identity [Britannica - Joan of Arc](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Saint-Joan-of-Arc).

## Historical Background

### Early Life
Joan of Arc was born into a peasant family in Domrémy, a small village in northeastern France, during a tumultuous period of the Hundred Years' War (1337–1453). This conflict saw England and France vying for control over French territory, with much of northern France under English domination by the early 15th century. Joan grew up in a devoutly Catholic household, and from the age of 13, she reported experiencing visions of saints, including Saint Michael, Saint Catherine, and Saint Margaret, who urged her to drive out the English and ensure the coronation of Charles VII as the rightful king of France [History - Joan of Arc](https://www.history.com/topics/middle-ages/joan-of-arc).

### Military Campaigns
In 1429, at the age of 17, Joan convinced local authorities to escort her to the French royal court at Chinon. There, she persuaded the uncrowned Charles VII to allow her to lead a military campaign to relieve the besieged city of Orléans. Dressed in armor and carrying a banner, Joan inspired the French troops with her faith and determination. Her leadership culminated in the lifting of the Siege of Orléans in May 1429, a turning point in the war that boosted French morale. Following this victory, she accompanied Charles VII to Reims, where he was crowned king on July 17, 1429, fulfilling one of her prophesied missions [National Geographic - Joan of Arc](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/joan-of-arc-warrior-saint-france).

Joan continued to participate in military campaigns, including attempts to recapture Paris, but her influence waned as political factions at court grew skeptical of her role. In May 1430, during a skirmish at Compiègne, she was captured by Burgundian forces, allies of the English, and sold to England for a ransom [BBC History - Joan of Arc](https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/joan_of_arc.shtml).

### Trial and Execution
Joan was imprisoned and subjected to a politically motivated trial in Rouen, under English control, beginning in January 1431. Charged with heresy, witchcraft, and dressing as a man (considered a violation of divine law at the time), her trial was overseen by pro-English clergy. Despite her articulate defense and claims of divine guidance, she was convicted and sentenced to death. On May 30, 1431, Joan of Arc was burned at the stake in Rouen’s marketplace at the age of 19. Her execution was intended to discredit her influence, but it instead cemented her martyrdom in the eyes of many French people [Smithsonian Magazine - Joan of Arc](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/who-was-joan-of-arc-180973551/).

### Rehabilitation and Canonization
In 1456, following the end of the Hundred Years' War, a posthumous retrial ordered by Charles VII cleared Joan of all charges, declaring her a martyr unjustly executed. Her reputation as a symbol of French resistance grew over centuries. In 1909, she was beatified by the Catholic Church, and on May 16, 1920, Pope Benedict XV canonized her as a saint, recognizing her piety and heroic virtue [Vatican - Joan of Arc](https://www.vatican.va/content/vatican/en.html).

## Current Status and Relevance

Today, Joan of Arc is celebrated as a cultural and historical icon in France and beyond. She is one of France’s patron saints and a symbol of national unity and resistance against oppression. Her feast day is observed on May 30, the anniversary of her execution. Statues, monuments, and annual commemorations in cities like Orléans and Rouen honor her legacy. Joan’s story continues to resonate in discussions of gender roles, faith, and military history, as she defied societal norms by leading armies as a young woman in a male-dominated era [The Guardian - Joan of Arc Legacy](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/30/joan-of-arc-600-years-french-heroine).

In modern popular culture, Joan of Arc has been depicted in numerous films, books, and plays, often as a figure of inspiration or tragic heroism. Her life raises ongoing debates among historians about the nature of her visions—whether they were spiritual, psychological, or a product of her environment—and her role as a military strategist versus a symbolic figurehead [History Today - Joan of Arc](https://www.historytoday.com/archive/feature/joan-arc).
