  "content": "# Sam Altman\n\nSamuel Harris Altman (born April 22, 1985) is an American entrepreneur, investor, and chief executive officer of OpenAI, an artificial intelligence research organization he co-founded in 2015.  \nBorn in Chicago, Illinois, and raised in St. Louis, Missouri, Altman attended Stanford University but dropped out to launch Loopt, a mobile location-sharing application that was acquired in 2012. In 2011, he joined Y Combinator, becoming its president in 2014 and leading the startup accelerator until 2019, during which it backed companies including Airbnb, Dropbox, and Reddit.  \nUnder Altman's stewardship at OpenAI, the organization developed foundational AI models such as GPT-3, DALL-E, and ChatGPT, the latter sparking global adoption after its 2022 debut and securing over $10 billion in funding from Microsoft. These advancements have positioned OpenAI as a leader in generative AI, though Altman's net worth of approximately $1 billion stems from personal investments in firms like Uber, Stripe, and nuclear fusion startup Helion Energy, not from OpenAI equity.  \nAltman's tenure has involved notable conflicts, including his abrupt dismissal by OpenAI's board in November 2023 over allegations of inconsistent candor, particularly on AI safety protocols and an internal letter warning of a major algorithmic advance, followed by swift reinstatement after nearly all employees threatened to depart. He has also co-founded Worldcoin, a blockchain-based identity verification system using iris scans, which has encountered regulatory bans and data deletion mandates in countries like Spain and Indonesia due to privacy violations. Critics have raised concerns about OpenAI's balance between rapid development and safety under his leadership, amid reports of internal friction over risk mitigation.\n\n## Early Life and Education\n\n### Family and Upbringing\n\nSam Altman was born on April 22, 1985, in Chicago, Illinois, into a Jewish family of Polish and Georgian American ancestry. His father, Jerry Altman (1950–2018), worked as a real estate broker, while his mother, Connie Gibstine, practiced as a dermatologist.  Altman was the eldest of four siblings, including brothers Max and Jack, and sister Annie. His father passed away on May 25, 2018.\n\nThe family relocated to the suburbs of St. Louis, Missouri—specifically the area around Clayton—shortly after his birth, where Altman spent his formative years in a middle-class household emphasizing education and intellectual pursuits.  He attended the private John Burroughs School, a preparatory institution known for its rigorous academics, during his high school years. From an early age, Altman displayed a strong aptitude for mathematics, programming, and technology, often engaging in self-directed coding projects and demonstrating entrepreneurial interests, such as building software applications as a teenager.\n\n### Academic Background\n\nAltman graduated from John Burroughs School, a private preparatory institution in St. Louis, Missouri, in 2003.\n\nHe subsequently enrolled at Stanford University, where he pursued a degree in computer science.\n\nAfter two years of study, Altman dropped out in 2005 at age 19 to co-found Loopt, a mobile location-sharing startup, following what he described as an unexpected entrepreneurial opportunity.\n\nAltman has since reflected that he learned more from practical experience outside academia than from formal coursework, though he holds no university degree.\n\n## Early Career and Entrepreneurship\n\n### Founding Loopt\n\nSam Altman co-founded Loopt, a mobile application enabling users to share their real-time locations with friends for social networking purposes, in 2005 alongside Stanford classmates Nick Sivo and Alok Deshpande. At age 19 and during his sophomore year at Stanford University, Altman dropped out to dedicate himself full-time to the startup, which he led as CEO. The concept emerged from early mobile technology trends, aiming to facilitate proximity-based interactions by leveraging GPS-enabled phones to alert users to nearby friends and suggest local discoveries.\n\nLoopt secured its initial seed funding through participation in Y Combinator's inaugural summer batch, providing the resources to develop a prototype and launch the service. This early backing, combined with Altman's pitch emphasizing the untapped potential of location-sharing in an era of emerging smartphones, positioned Loopt as a pioneer in geosocial networking ahead of competitors like Foursquare. The founding team operated from Mountain View, California, focusing on partnerships with mobile carriers to distribute the app via pre-installation on devices.\n\n### Initial Investments and Projects\n\nFollowing the acquisition of Loopt by Green Dot Corporation for $43.4 million in March 2012, Altman shifted focus from operational entrepreneurship to investing, establishing Hydrazine Capital as an early-stage venture capital firm that year. Co-founded with his brother Jack Altman, the firm targeted high-risk, ambitious technology ventures, including those in education, consumer networks, and enterprise software, with a preference for \"moonshot\" opportunities over conventional startups. Hydrazine's debut fund raised $21 million, drawing from Altman's Loopt proceeds and external limited partners to back founders pursuing transformative ideas.\n\nIn parallel with Hydrazine, Altman pursued personal angel investments starting around 2010, emphasizing early-stage companies with scalable potential. Notable early bets included Pinterest, a visual discovery platform founded in 2010; Optimizely, an A/B testing software provider launched in 2010; Teespring, a custom merchandise e-commerce site started in 2011; and Oyster, a book subscription service initiated in 2013. These investments reflected Altman's strategy of allocating a significant portion—reportedly 75% in some cases—of his capital to high-conviction, contrarian opportunities rather than diversified portfolios, often in sectors like social media, analytics, and e-commerce. Such approaches yielded substantial returns, as exits like Pinterest's 2019 IPO valued at over $10 billion underscored the efficacy of his selective, founder-focused thesis.\n\nAltman's early investing phase also involved advisory roles and seed funding in agriculture tech via FarmLogs (later rebranded Bushel Farm) and fintech through Alt, prioritizing empirical validation of product-market fit over hype-driven trends. By 2012, these activities had positioned him as a prolific Silicon Valley angel, with over a dozen disclosed deals, though detailed returns remain private; critics note that while successes like these amplified his influence, survivorship bias in public narratives may overstate consistency amid unreported losses in riskier bets.\n\n## Y Combinator Leadership\n\n### Rise to Presidency\n\nAltman first engaged with Y Combinator as a participant in its inaugural summer 2005 batch, co-founding the mobile check-in startup Loopt, which received early funding from the accelerator. After Loopt's acquisition by Green Dot Corporation in 2012 for $43.4 million, Altman transitioned into a more active role at Y Combinator, joining as a partner in 2011 to assist with startup selection, mentoring, and operational scaling. In this capacity, he contributed to evaluating applications, conducting interviews, and fostering connections between portfolio companies and investors, leveraging his entrepreneurial experience to identify promising founders.\n\nBy mid-2012, Y Combinator co-founder Paul Graham, who had led the organization since its inception in 2005, began considering a leadership transition after nine years of overseeing batches that funded over 500 startups, including successes like Airbnb and Dropbox. Graham approached Altman about succeeding him, citing Altman's demonstrated operational acumen, relentless energy, and ability to build relationships with top technical talent as key factors in the decision.  Altman initially hesitated but agreed after discussions, viewing the role as an opportunity to institutionalize Y Combinator's processes amid its rapid growth from a niche accelerator to a powerhouse handling multiple batches annually and managing a portfolio valued in billions.\n\nOn February 21, 2014, Graham publicly announced Altman's appointment as president, effective for the subsequent batch starting in summer 2014, while Graham planned to retain involvement through office hours and essay writing.  This handover marked a generational shift at Y Combinator, with Altman, at age 28, assuming responsibility for day-to-day leadership, including batch operations, partner recruitment, and strategic expansions like increasing deal flow and international outreach. Under the transition, Y Combinator continued its twice-yearly model but emphasized scalability, with Altman focusing on attracting elite engineers and refining the founder's advice model that Graham had pioneered.\n\n### Key Initiatives and Portfolio Growth\n\nDuring Sam Altman's presidency of Y Combinator from 2014 to 2019, the accelerator expanded its scale and scope, funding hundreds more startups annually through larger batch sizes and enhanced support mechanisms. This growth built on Y Combinator's earlier model, with Altman's leadership emphasizing operational efficiency and long-term founder assistance, including a focus on scaling successful alumni companies rather than solely early-stage seed investments.\n\nA pivotal initiative was the 2015 launch of the Y Combinator Continuity Fund, a $700 million vehicle designed to provide pro rata follow-on investments in high-performing portfolio companies post-Demo Day, thereby retaining equity in breakout successes like Airbnb and Stripe without diluting early commitments. This fund marked a shift toward later-stage involvement, allowing Y Combinator to participate in subsequent rounds and support growth trajectories that generated substantial returns for the program's investors.\n\nAltman also drove international outreach to diversify the portfolio beyond Silicon Valley, announcing plans for Y Combinator China in 2016 to tap into Asia's emerging tech ecosystems and expressing intent to explore similar models in India. In October 2015, during a visit to India, he forecasted the rise of multiple $10 billion-plus startups there, underscoring Y Combinator's potential role in funding them through adapted programs. Although YC China operated briefly before closing in 2019 amid geopolitical challenges, these efforts reflected Altman's vision of exponentially scaling Y Combinator's global footprint.\n\nBy the end of Altman's tenure in March 2019, Y Combinator's portfolio had ballooned to include over 1,800 companies, with aggregate valuations exceeding tens of billions and a surge in unicorn outcomes driven by the expanded intake and Continuity support. This period solidified Y Combinator's dominance in startup acceleration, though critics noted risks of diluted per-company attention amid the rapid intake growth.\n\n## OpenAI Involvement\n\n### Founding and Early Structure\n\nOpenAI was publicly announced on December 11, 2015, as a non-profit research organization dedicated to developing artificial general intelligence (AGI) in a manner that ensures broad benefits to humanity, countering potential risks from unchecked AI advancement by profit-driven entities. The founding team included Sam Altman, Elon Musk, Greg Brockman, Ilya Sutskever, Wojciech Zaremba, and John Schulman, with additional support from Reid Hoffman, Jessica Livingston, Peter Thiel, and entities such as Amazon Web Services and Infosys. Altman, then president of Y Combinator, and Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, served as co-chairs of the initial board, reflecting their shared concerns over AI safety amid rapid progress in the field.\n\nThe organization's charter emphasized open collaboration and research publication to democratize AI progress, explicitly rejecting a closed-source, commercial model akin to those of major tech firms. Initial leadership placed Greg Brockman as president and chief technology officer, overseeing technical direction, while Ilya Sutskever was named chief scientist to lead core research efforts. Sam Altman focused on strategic oversight and fundraising as co-chair, leveraging his venture capital experience without holding an operational executive role at launch.\n\nFunding commenced with a publicly pledged $1 billion commitment, driven by Musk's insistence on a high-profile announcement to attract talent and resources, though Altman had initially targeted $100 million; actual early donations totaled under $130 million by 2019, including less than $45 million from Musk and personal investments from Altman. This capital supported a small team of researchers working on foundational AI projects, such as reinforcement learning environments, without revenue-generating products.\n\nStructurally, OpenAI operated as a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt non-profit corporation governed by a board prioritizing mission alignment over financial returns, with decisions centered on long-term AGI safety rather than short-term commercialization. This framework allowed for unrestricted research dissemination in early years, including open-sourcing tools like the OpenAI Gym in 2016, fostering external contributions while building internal capabilities in deep learning. The non-profit model was explicitly designed to insulate AGI development from investor pressures, though it later revealed limitations in scaling compute-intensive research.\n\n### Shift to Scaled Operations\n\nIn March 2019, OpenAI announced a restructuring from a pure nonprofit to a \"capped-profit\" model, creating OpenAI LP as a subsidiary to attract external capital for scaling AI research and development. This shift addressed the organization's growing need for billions in funding to acquire vast computational resources, as training advanced models required resources far exceeding what nonprofit donations could provide. Sam Altman, then president of OpenAI, played a central role in advocating for the change, emphasizing that rapid scaling of compute infrastructure was essential to compete in AI advancement and that traditional nonprofit constraints would hinder progress. \n\nThe capped-profit structure limited investor returns to 100 times their investment to prioritize the nonprofit parent's mission of safe AGI development, enabling OpenAI to secure over $13 billion from Microsoft by 2023. In July 2019, this facilitated an initial $1 billion investment from Microsoft, paired with an exclusive Azure cloud computing partnership to build supercomputing clusters for model training. Operationally, the transition marked a pivot from open-source research prototypes to proprietary, scaled deployments: OpenAI expanded its team from dozens to hundreds of researchers and engineers, invested in custom hardware like GPU clusters totaling hundreds of thousands of processors, and launched commercial APIs for models such as GPT-3 in June 2020, which featured 175 billion parameters and required unprecedented 3.14 × 10^23 FLOPs for training. \n\nUnder Altman's leadership, this scaling emphasized iterative model improvements and enterprise integrations, with Microsoft embedding OpenAI tech into products like Bing and Office 365 starting in 2023, driving operational revenue from near-zero to over $1 billion annually by mid-2023. The move drew internal debate over mission drift—critics argued it prioritized commercialization over safety—but Altman maintained it was necessary for empirical progress in AI capabilities, as nonprofit limits would cede ground to profit-driven competitors. By late 2022, scaled operations culminated in the public release of ChatGPT, which amassed 100 million users within two months, validating the infrastructure buildup but exposing tensions in governance and resource allocation.\n\n### Major Product Releases\n\nOpenAI's major product releases under Sam Altman's CEO tenure from 2019 onward have centered on advancing large language models, multimodal capabilities, and accessible interfaces, with flagship launches including the GPT series and derived applications. These releases shifted OpenAI from research-focused operations to scaled deployment, emphasizing API access, consumer tools, and iterative improvements in reasoning, generation, and integration.\n\nThe GPT-3 model, featuring 175 billion parameters, was released on June 11, 2020, initially via a beta API, enabling applications in text completion, conversation, and search. This marked a pivotal expansion in generative capabilities, powering over 300 third-party apps by March 2021.\n\nDALL·E, OpenAI's first text-to-image generation model, launched on January 5, 2021, demonstrating novel synthesis of descriptive prompts into visuals using a 12-billion-parameter transformer. DALL·E 2 followed on April 6, 2022, with enhanced photorealism and editing features via inpainting and outpainting. DALL·E 3, released September 20, 2023, improved prompt adherence and integration with ChatGPT for Plus users.\n\nChatGPT, powered by a fine-tuned GPT-3.5, debuted publicly on November 30, 2022, rapidly achieving one million users in five days and mainstreaming conversational AI. GPT-4 launched March 14, 2023, offering superior reliability, creativity, and multimodal input handling via ChatGPT Plus and API.\n\nSubsequent multimodal expansions included GPT-4o on May 13, 2024, unifying text, audio, and vision processing with real-time responsiveness for free and paid tiers. Sora, a text-to-video model, previewed in February 2024 and fully released December 9, 2024, with Sora Turbo for faster generation; Sora 2 arrived September 30, 2025, emphasizing hyperreal motion. The o1 reasoning model series previewed September 12, 2024, and fully released December 5, 2024, prioritizing chain-of-thought processing for complex tasks like coding and math.\n\nIn 2025, GPT-5 unified efficient and reasoning-focused variants, launching August 7 for Enterprise and Edu plans. ChatGPT Atlas, a browser integrated with ChatGPT, rolled out October 21.\n\n| Product | Release Date | Key Capabilities |\n|---------|--------------|------------------|\n| GPT-3 | June 11, 2020 | 175B parameters; API for text generation and apps |\n| DALL·E | January 5, 2021 | Text-to-image synthesis |\n| DALL·E 2 | April 6, 2022 | Photorealism, editing tools |\n| ChatGPT (GPT-3.5) | November 30, 2022 | Conversational interface; rapid user adoption |\n| GPT-4 | March 14, 2023 | Multimodal, enhanced problem-solving |\n| DALL·E 3 | September 20, 2023 | Better prompt fidelity, ChatGPT integration |\n| GPT-4o | May 13, 2024 | Unified multimodal (text/audio/vision) |\n| Sora | December 9, 2024 (full) | Text-to-video generation |\n| o1 | December 5, 2024 (full) | Advanced reasoning via thinking steps |\n| GPT-5 | August 7, 2025 | Unified model with reasoning mode |\n\n### 2023 Leadership Crisis\n\nOn November 17, 2023, OpenAI's board of directors abruptly removed Sam Altman as CEO and from the board, stating that he \"was not consistently candid in his communications with the board,\" which led to a loss of confidence in his ability to lead the organization. The board, composed of non-profit overseers including Ilya Sutskever and Helen Toner, appointed Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati as interim CEO, while President Greg Brockman initially planned to remain in his role but resigned shortly after in solidarity with Altman. This decision stemmed from escalating tensions between Altman and the board over OpenAI's direction, particularly Altman's push for rapid commercialization and for-profit restructuring, which clashed with the board's emphasis on AI safety and adherence to the company's original non-profit mission to ensure artificial general intelligence benefits humanity. Former board member Helen Toner later attributed the ouster to Altman's withholding of key information, such as advance notice of a public letter he signed criticizing AI safety efforts, and patterns of behavior including creating a \"toxic atmosphere of fear\" through complaints about board members.\n\nThe removal triggered immediate turmoil, with over 95% of OpenAI's approximately 770 employees signing an open letter threatening to resign and join Altman if the board did not reverse course, many indicating they would move to Microsoft, OpenAI's largest investor with a $13 billion stake. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella announced on November 20 that Altman and Brockman would lead a new AI research team at Microsoft, heightening pressure on the board amid investor concerns and the risk of talent exodus. Sutskever, initially supportive of the firing, expressed regret and advocated for Altman's return, contributing to the board's collapse as members resigned.\n\nOn November 22, 2023, OpenAI announced Altman's reinstatement as CEO, along with Brockman rejoining the company, under a restructured board chaired by Bret Taylor and including Larry Summers and Adam D'Angelo, effectively replacing the prior board. The agreement ensured Microsoft's continued involvement without gaining board seats, while OpenAI committed to an independent safety framework review. A subsequent external investigation in March 2024 concluded that Altman's conduct \"did not mandate removal\" and affirmed him and Brockman as appropriate leaders, leading to Altman's addition to the new board. The crisis highlighted underlying governance fractures in OpenAI's hybrid non-profit/for-profit structure, with critics attributing the board's caution to overly idealistic safety priorities amid competitive pressures from rivals like Anthropic and Google, though empirical evidence of Altman's alleged candor issues remained tied to internal deliberations not fully disclosed.\n\n### Post-2023 Developments and Expansions\n\nIn 2024, OpenAI accelerated product innovation with releases such as the GPT-4o model in May, featuring improved voice and vision capabilities, and the o1 reasoning model series in September, emphasizing advanced problem-solving in math and coding. At DevDay 2024 on October 1, the company unveiled the Realtime API for low-latency voice interactions, vision fine-tuning for custom image processing, and prompt caching to reduce costs by up to 50% for repeated queries, targeting developer accessibility and enterprise adoption. These advancements supported revenue growth, with OpenAI reporting annualized revenues exceeding $3.5 billion by late 2024, driven by ChatGPT subscriptions and API usage.\n\nFunding scaled dramatically in 2025, beginning with a record $40 billion round closed on March 31, led by SoftBank, which valued OpenAI at approximately $150 billion post-money and funded compute infrastructure. By October 2, a $6.6 billion share sale pushed the valuation to $500 billion, incorporating prior investments and enabling further capital for AI hardware. Infrastructure expansions included a September announcement of a 17-gigawatt data center buildout across multiple sites, projected at $850 billion in costs, in partnerships with Oracle, Nvidia, and others to address compute bottlenecks. Additional deals encompassed a multi-year agreement with AMD on October 6 for 6 gigawatts of Instinct GPUs starting in 2026, and a collaboration with Broadcom on October 13 for 10 gigawatts of custom AI accelerators.\n\nProduct launches continued with GPT-5 on August 7, described as faster and more capable across general tasks, made available to all ChatGPT users. In December 2024, the o3 model debuted, followed by o3-mini on January 31, 2025, optimized for cost-efficient reasoning in coding and math; GPT-4.1 arrived in April with enhancements in long-context handling and instruction adherence. Enterprise efforts intensified at DevDay 2025 on October 3, where Altman highlighted integrations with apps like Spotify and Zillow, alongside a \"huge focus\" on business growth via partnerships including Salesforce on October 14 for AI-enhanced CRM tools. On October 21, OpenAI introduced ChatGPT Atlas, a browser embedding ChatGPT for seamless AI-assisted web navigation.\n\nThese moves reflected OpenAI's shift toward massive compute scaling and commercialization, with Altman seeking additional funds in regions like the UAE in October for ongoing infrastructure needs, amid projections of $1 trillion in total investments to sustain AGI pursuits.\n\n## Venture Investments and Other Projects\n\n### Worldcoin Initiative\n\nSam Altman co-founded Tools for Humanity in 2019 alongside Alex Blania and Max Novendstern, with Altman serving as chairman; the company focuses on developing biometric technologies to verify human identity amid advancing artificial intelligence. The firm created the Worldcoin project—later rebranded toward \"World\"—to establish a blockchain-based protocol for \"proof-of-personhood,\" using iris scans to distinguish individual humans from bots or duplicates in digital systems.\n\nThe project publicly launched on July 24, 2023, deploying spherical devices called Orbs that scan users' irises in about 30 seconds to generate a hashed code for a unique World ID, which the company claims is created without retaining raw biometric images, employing zero-knowledge proofs to preserve anonymity. Verified users receive this ID for online human authentication and allocations of the native WLD token, with the system designed to enable equitable distribution of resources, such as universal basic income, in an era of AI-driven abundance by mitigating Sybil attacks where one entity creates multiple fake identities. Altman has articulated the core aim as constructing a global identity and financial network grounded in verifiable uniqueness, essential for economic fairness as AI erodes traditional proofs like passwords or documents.\n\nBy October 2025, the initiative had verified over 17 million unique individuals, amassed 37 million World App users, and operated in more than 160 countries, with daily verifications exceeding 40,000 and wallet transactions surpassing 2.6 million. Expansion into the United States began in May 2025, starting with cities like San Francisco, where Orbs were deployed for public scanning despite technical glitches at initial sites. The WLD token experienced volatility, surging over 50% to $2.03 in early October 2025 amid broader crypto market movements.\n\nRegulatory challenges have persisted, with authorities in multiple jurisdictions questioning biometric data practices despite Tools for Humanity's assertions of on-device processing and immediate deletion of iris images to avoid centralized storage risks. A Kenyan High Court ruled in May 2025 that collections violated data protection laws, mandating deletion of unlawfully gathered biometrics from thousands of users. France's privacy watchdog deemed the approach's legality questionable shortly after launch, citing inadequate consent for sensitive data. On October 24, 2025, Thai regulators raided over 100 iris-scanning sites linked to Worldcoin exchanges, arresting operators for unlicensed digital asset activities and highlighting ongoing compliance gaps. The Philippines' National Privacy Commission similarly directed cessation of processing in 2025, emphasizing that biometric data cannot be commodified. Critics, including privacy advocates, contend that the model's incentives—offering crypto for scans—may exploit vulnerable populations and expose irises, an immutable biometric, to irreversible harms from potential hacks or state coercion, even if raw data is not stored. The company counters that the protocol's decentralized design and fraud checks enhance security over alternatives like government IDs, though empirical regulatory findings indicate persistent legal hurdles in data sovereignty and consent.\n\n### Energy and Fusion Investments\n\nSam Altman has made substantial personal investments in energy technologies, motivated by the anticipated surge in electricity demand from artificial intelligence data centers. In November 2021, he led a $500 million Series E funding round for Helion Energy, a nuclear fusion startup developing pulsed magnetic fusion reactors, marking his largest individual investment at approximately $375 million. Helion, founded in 2013, aims to achieve net electricity production from fusion by compressing plasma with high-powered magnets to initiate deuterium-helium-3 reactions, targeting commercial deployment of a 50-megawatt plant by 2028 under a power purchase agreement with Microsoft.\n\nIn January 2025, Altman participated in Helion's $425 million Series F round, led by Lightspeed Venture Partners and including SoftBank, bringing the company's total funding to over $1 billion and its post-money valuation to $5.425 billion. These funds support construction of Helion's Polaris prototype reactor in Washington state, which began in July 2025, and scaling toward electricity-generating fusion systems. Altman's backing reflects a strategic alignment with OpenAI's energy needs, as fusion promises high-density, low-carbon power without intermittent supply issues plaguing renewables.\n\nBeyond fusion, Altman has invested in complementary energy ventures. He backed Oklo, an advanced nuclear fission company developing small modular reactors, with early funding contributing to its focus on safe, scalable atomic power for AI infrastructure. In August 2024, he led a $20 million seed round for Exowatt, a solar thermal startup using mirrors to concentrate sunlight for continuous baseload electricity, addressing AI's 24/7 power requirements without battery storage dependencies. These investments underscore Altman's view that breakthroughs in dense, reliable energy sources are prerequisites for widespread AI adoption, potentially averting grid constraints projected to require terawatts of additional capacity by 2030.\n\n### Biotech and Health Ventures\n\nAltman has directed substantial personal investments toward biotechnology companies focused on longevity and age-related diseases, reflecting his interest in extending human healthspan through cellular and therapeutic interventions. In 2022, he led a $180 million funding round for Retro Biosciences, a San Francisco-based startup founded in 2021 that targets the biological drivers of aging, including cellular senescence, autophagy, and plasma factors, with the explicit goal of adding 10 healthy years to the human lifespan. The company's approach emphasizes reprogramming cells to a youthful state, drawing on research from scientists like David Sinclair and Juan Carlos Izpisúa Belmonte, though such methods remain experimental and face challenges in translating preclinical results to human efficacy.\n\nBy January 2025, Altman increased his commitment to Retro Biosciences amid its pursuit of a $1 billion funding round to accelerate clinical development of three drug candidates, including an oral therapy aimed at reversing Alzheimer's disease pathology through epigenetic reprogramming, with human trials slated to begin that year. The firm employs artificial intelligence to identify and optimize targets, such as enhancing mitophagy to clear damaged cellular components, but critics note that longevity claims often outpace validated outcomes in the field, where historical interventions have yielded marginal gains in model organisms rather than consistent human extensions.\n\nIn parallel, Altman co-launched Thrive AI Health in July 2024 with Arianna Huffington, positioning it as an artificial intelligence-driven platform to deliver personalized coaching on sleep, nutrition, exercise, stress reduction, and social connections, framed as a \"miracle drug\" equivalent for behavioral health optimization to combat age-related decline. The venture integrates data from wearables and user inputs to foster habit formation, building on evidence that lifestyle modifications can influence biomarkers of aging, though its efficacy depends on user adherence and the limitations of AI in replacing clinical oversight. These efforts underscore Altman's broader portfolio strategy, which allocates hundreds of millions toward speculative biotech amid debates over whether such pursuits prioritize incremental health improvements or overhyped radical extensions.\n\n### Emerging Tech Pursuits (e.g., Brain-Computer Interfaces)\n\nSam Altman has previously invested in Neuralink, Elon Musk's brain-computer interface (BCI) company, reflecting early interest in neural technologies aimed at enhancing human cognition through direct brain-machine connections.\n\nIn August 2025, Altman co-founded Merge Labs, a BCI startup positioned as a competitor to Neuralink, with OpenAI planning to invest up to $250 million in the venture at an $850 million valuation. Merge Labs focuses on developing less invasive BCI methods compared to Neuralink's surgical implants, exploring techniques such as ultrasound sound waves and magnetic fields to enable non-surgical brain signal detection and modulation.\n\nThe company has recruited Mikhail Shapiro, a biomolecular engineer from the California Institute of Technology, to advance its research into innovative interfacing methods, including potential gene therapy approaches to modify brain cells for improved signal compatibility with external devices. These efforts align with broader tech industry bets on BCIs as a foundational platform for merging human intelligence with artificial systems, though Merge Labs' technologies remain in early development stages without publicly demonstrated prototypes as of October 2025.\n\n## Intellectual and Philosophical Views\n\n### AI Safety and Alignment Perspectives\n\nSam Altman has articulated concerns about existential risks from advanced AI, stating in a May 2023 open letter co-signed with other industry figures that \"mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war.\" In his February 2023 OpenAI blog post \"Planning for AGI and beyond,\" Altman outlined a framework for ensuring artificial general intelligence (AGI) benefits humanity, emphasizing the need to \"successfully navigate massive risks\" through shared governance, equitable access, and cautious scaling of systems closer to AGI. He advocated for iterative deployment—releasing models incrementally with safety evaluations—over outright pauses, critiquing a March 2023 open letter calling for a six-month halt on training systems more powerful than GPT-4 as lacking \"technical nuance\" despite agreeing with its underlying worries about unprepared deployment.\n\nDuring his May 16, 2023, testimony before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, Altman warned of AI's potential to \"go quite wrong\" through misuse in disinformation, bioterrorism, or loss of control, while stressing that regulation should focus on high-risk applications without stifling innovation. He supported licensing requirements for powerful models and independent audits but opposed mandatory pre-release vetting, arguing it would disadvantage U.S. firms against less-regulated competitors. OpenAI under Altman launched the Superalignment team in July 2023, dedicating significant compute resources to solving alignment for superintelligent systems within four years, though the effort dissolved in May 2024 amid resignations from key researchers like Jan Leike and Ilya Sutskever, who cited insufficient prioritization of safety over product development. Altman responded by forming a new safety and security committee in May 2024, which he initially chaired alongside board members, before stepping down from it in September 2024.\n\nIn June 2025's \"The Gentle Singularity\" blog post, Altman described alignment as solvable through robust guarantees that AI systems \"learn and act towards what we collectively really want,\" framing rapid progress as enabling a controlled transition rather than catastrophe. He has maintained that OpenAI's approach integrates safety via empirical testing and scalable oversight, rejecting decelerationist pauses in favor of leading global standards, as reiterated in January 2025 reflections where he affirmed confidence in building AGI responsibly. Critics from AI safety communities, including former OpenAI researchers, argue Altman's emphasis on acceleration—evident in pursuits like custom chip development—undermines long-term alignment efforts by prioritizing deployment speed. Altman counters that competitive pressures necessitate U.S. leadership in safe AI to prevent unchecked development elsewhere.\n\n### Predictions on AGI and Superintelligence\n\nSam Altman has defined artificial general intelligence (AGI) as systems capable of tackling increasingly complex problems at human level across many fields, noting that traditional definitions from five years prior have already been surpassed by current models. He expressed confidence in January 2025 that OpenAI understands the path to building such AGI, describing it as a milestone along a continuum toward greater capabilities rather than a singular endpoint. Altman predicted in early 2025 that AI agents could join the workforce and materially boost company output within that year, with systems capable of novel insights emerging by 2026 and practical robots by 2027.\n\nRegarding timelines, Altman has forecasted AGI arriving sooner than most expect, potentially by 2025 or within the next few years, though he emphasized it would integrate gradually with limited immediate societal disruption. He contrasted this with broader expert surveys placing high-probability AGI emergence between 2040 and 2075, attributing his shorter horizon to rapid scaling in compute and data. In a June 2025 blog post, Altman described a \"gentle singularity,\" where AGI benchmarks pass quietly amid compounding progress, leading to transformative but adaptive changes rather than abrupt upheaval.\n\nOn superintelligence—AI exceeding human intelligence across all domains—Altman predicted in September 2024 that it could arrive in \"a few thousand days,\" implying roughly 5 to 8 years from that point, or by the early 2030s. He reiterated in September 2025 that extraordinarily capable models surpassing humans would likely exist by 2030, enabling breakthroughs in science and invention beyond current paradigms. Altman views superintelligence as the true focus beyond AGI, cautioning that while timelines remain uncertain due to scaling challenges, sustained investment in infrastructure like energy and chips will accelerate its realization. He anticipates this shift will empower humanity through abundance but requires proactive alignment to mitigate risks, aligning with OpenAI's mission since its founding.\n\n### Economic and Societal Transformation Theories\n\nSam Altman posits that artificial intelligence will usher in an \"Intelligence Age,\" characterized by abundant computational intelligence that fundamentally alters economic productivity and societal structures, akin to how infrastructure has amplified human capabilities historically. In this framework, AI-driven advancements will accelerate scientific progress and problem-solving at scales unattainable by humans alone, leading to exponential economic growth through cheaper and more accessible intelligence. Altman argues that intelligence, paired with energy abundance, will become the primary drivers of prosperity in the 2030s, enabling widespread improvements in living standards without relying on genetic or population changes.\n\nCentral to Altman's economic theories is the expectation of transformative productivity gains from AI, potentially rivaling or exceeding historical industrial revolutions. He anticipates that AI systems, evolving toward artificial general intelligence (AGI) by the late 2020s, will automate up to 40% of current tasks, displacing jobs in sectors like healthcare and logistics while compounding automation to create new economic activities.  Altman contends that such disruptions will not result in permanent unemployment, as societies historically adapt by inventing novel pursuits; he dismisses fears of joblessness by questioning the inherent value of many contemporary roles, suggesting AI elimination of \"unreal\" work could redirect human effort toward higher-value endeavors.  To mitigate transitional inequalities from uneven AGI impacts—where some industries remain static while others advance rapidly—Altman advocates for policies like universal basic income (UBI), funded in part by AI-generated wealth, as evidenced by his 2016-2019 experiment providing $1,000 monthly to low-income recipients, which improved financial stability without broadly reducing employment. \n\nOn societal transformation, Altman envisions a \"gentle singularity\" where superintelligence becomes inexpensive and democratized, averting concentration of power and fostering collective benefits such as solving climate challenges or enhancing governance through AI-augmented decision-making. He predicts that by 2035, AI could generate staggering economic value, potentially creating trillion-dollar industries and enabling post-scarcity conditions, though he cautions that governance failures could exacerbate risks like inequality or misuse. These theories draw from first-hand observations at OpenAI, where rapid model improvements signal broader socioeconomic shifts sooner than public consensus anticipates, as outlined in Altman's 2021 essay on extending Moore's Law to societal domains. Critics, however, note that Altman's optimism assumes seamless adaptation and equitable distribution, potentially underestimating persistent structural barriers in labor markets or regulatory lags.\n\n## Political Engagement and Advocacy\n\n### Donations and Electoral Support\n\nSam Altman has primarily directed his political donations to Democratic candidates and causes, with Federal Election Commission records showing contributions totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars to figures such as Elizabeth Warren ($2,700 in 2018), Kamala Harris (multiple donations over the years), and Charles Schumer ($5,800 in June 2023). In 2020, he contributed $250,000 to a Democratic super PAC supporting Joe Biden's presidential campaign, marking one of his largest individual political outlays at the time. These donations align with broader patterns among Silicon Valley executives favoring progressive policies on technology regulation and social issues, though Altman's support has extended to state-level efforts, including a $200 contribution in 2008 opposing California's Proposition 8, which sought to ban same-sex marriage.\n\nMore recently, Altman has diversified his electoral support beyond Democrats, donating $3,300 to Republican Senator Ted Cruz in October 2024 and $3,300 to independent Senator Kyrsten Sinema in October 2023. In December 2024, he personally gave $1 million to Donald Trump's inauguration fund, a move that prompted criticism from Democratic Senators Elizabeth Warren and Adam Schiff, who questioned potential conflicts of interest given OpenAI's regulatory entanglements. Altman defended the donation as a gesture of goodwill toward the incoming administration, rejecting allegations of seeking favors. This shift reflects a pragmatic approach amid evolving tech-policy dynamics, including Altman's hosting of a fundraiser for Democratic Senator Mark Warner in March 2025, indicating continued engagement with both parties.\n\nAltman's donation history underscores his influence in shaping electoral outcomes favorable to AI innovation, with over 100 contributions to Democrats documented through 2024, though he has publicly distanced himself from partisan loyalty, describing himself as \"politically homeless\" in July 2025 amid frustrations with the Democratic Party's direction.\n\n### Positions on Regulation and Policy\n\nIn May 2023, Sam Altman testified before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology, and the Law, advocating for federal regulation of advanced AI systems to address potential risks such as societal disruption or misuse. He proposed licensing or registration requirements for AI models surpassing a critical capability threshold, mandating internal and external safety testing, publication of evaluation results, and compliance incentives to encourage adherence. Altman emphasized the need for an enforcement mechanism with real authority, including the potential shutdown of non-compliant systems, while stressing international cooperation through global licensing standards and intergovernmental oversight akin to nuclear non-proliferation frameworks. \n\nAltman balanced these calls for oversight with safeguards for innovation, recommending a flexible, multi-stakeholder process to iteratively develop safety standards, disclosures, and validation methods that adapt to AI's rapid evolution, ensuring broad access to benefits without ceding U.S. leadership to authoritarian regimes. He has critiqued overly prescriptive approaches, such as the European Union's AI Act, arguing they could hinder technological access and diffusion, particularly in regions needing AI for economic growth. \n\nBy May 2025, in testimony before the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, Altman shifted toward opposing stringent pre-release government approvals for powerful AI models, deeming them \"disastrous\" for stifling U.S. competitiveness against China, where development lags by mere months.  He advocated \"light-touch\" federal legislation, including regulatory sandboxes to test AI deployments without barriers, a unified national framework to preempt fragmented state rules, and a possible 10-year moratorium on heavy oversight to prioritize infrastructure investments in energy and computing.  This evolution reflects a broader industry pivot from seeking guardrails to emphasizing rapid scaling and global adoption of American AI to maintain strategic advantages.\n\nAltman has consistently supported context-specific regulation—tailored to AI applications like autonomous weapons or high-stakes decision-making—over blanket rules, arguing policy should follow scientific progress rather than preempt it, drawing parallels to the lightly regulated internet's success in fostering innovation.  He proposes an international agency, modeled on the International Atomic Energy Agency, for monitoring advanced AI development, but warns against measures that could fragment markets or empower rivals.\n\n### Critiques of Government Intervention\n\nSam Altman has criticized government interventions that hinder rapid technological advancement, particularly those involving bureaucratic delays in infrastructure development essential for artificial intelligence scaling. In advocating for accelerated AI progress to maintain U.S. competitiveness against China, Altman has highlighted permitting processes as a major bottleneck for building data centers and energy facilities required to power large-scale AI training. For instance, during a September 2024 White House meeting, OpenAI proposed constructing multiple 5-gigawatt data centers—each consuming power equivalent to a major city—while urging federal approval to bypass protracted environmental and regulatory reviews that could delay deployment by years. This stance reflects Altman's view that excessive regulatory hurdles risk ceding global AI leadership, as slower infrastructure rollout could impede the exponential compute demands projected for advanced models.\n\nIn congressional testimony on May 8, 2025, before the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, Altman rejected proposals for mandatory pre-deployment vetting of AI systems, arguing they would stifle innovation without commensurate safety benefits. He emphasized \"sensible regulation that does not slow us down,\" positioning overly prescriptive rules as counterproductive to addressing AI risks through agile, industry-led measures. Altman has similarly critiqued international frameworks, such as the European Union's AI Act, for imposing burdens that disadvantage Western developers relative to less-regulated competitors in regions like China.\n\nAltman's broader reservations extend to government overreach in economic policy, where he has warned that interventions failing to adapt to technological disruption—such as rigid labor market rules amid AI-driven job displacement—could exacerbate inequality without fostering growth. In a 2024 interview, he opposed blanket government regulation of AI deployment, favoring targeted oversight on high-risk applications while decrying broad controls that might preemptively constrain beneficial innovations. These positions mark an evolution from his 2023 calls for regulatory frameworks, underscoring a preference for minimal intervention to prioritize speed and private-sector dynamism in AI infrastructure and governance.\n\n## Controversies and Criticisms\n\n### OpenAI Governance Disputes\n\nOn November 17, 2023, OpenAI's board of directors abruptly removed Sam Altman as CEO and from the board, stating that the decision followed a \"deliberative review process\" which concluded Altman \"was not consistently candid in his communications with the board, hindering the board’s ability to exercise its responsibilities.\" The board, composed primarily of independent members including Helen Toner, Tasha McCauley, and Ilya Sutskever, did not consult major investors like Microsoft beforehand, leading to immediate backlash from employees and partners. Altman was temporarily replaced by board observer Mira Murati, then briefly by Emmett Shear, amid threats of mass employee resignations and Microsoft's consideration of alternative leadership.\n\nAccording to former board member Helen Toner, in retrospective interviews, the ouster resulted from accumulated trust erosion, including Altman's failure to disclose his personal ownership of the OpenAI Startup Fund—a $175 million venture fund backing external AI startups—which conflicted with board oversight; withholding details on internal safety assessments; and efforts to oust Toner herself by leaking her name to media outlets and federal agencies without board knowledge. Toner emphasized these actions constituted \"outright lying\" that undermined the board's capacity to monitor OpenAI's balance between rapid commercialization and its founding nonprofit mission to ensure artificial general intelligence benefits humanity. The board's concerns reflected deeper tensions over Altman's push for aggressive product launches, such as GPT-4, potentially at the expense of safety protocols, though no single technical breakthrough triggered the decision.\n\nAltman was reinstated as CEO on November 22, 2023, following negotiations influenced by over 700 employee signatures threatening to leave and Microsoft's $13 billion investment stake, with a new board installed excluding the original dissenters except Sutskever, who later departed. Bret Taylor, former co-CEO of Salesforce, became board chair, joined by figures like Larry Summers, signaling a tilt toward business-oriented governance. Toner and McCauley resigned shortly after, citing inability to trust Altman's leadership.\n\nPost-reinstatement, disputes centered on OpenAI's hybrid nonprofit-for-profit structure, originally designed to prioritize public benefit over profits. In September 2024, plans emerged to eliminate the nonprofit parent's veto power over the capped-profit subsidiary, allowing full for-profit conversion and granting Altman equity for the first time, amid a valuation exceeding $150 billion. This shift drew criticism for potentially diluting mission safeguards, prompting California's Attorney General to investigate compliance with nonprofit laws in January 2025. In May 2025, OpenAI announced it would dial back elements of the previously reported restructuring so that the nonprofit parent would retain control, following external pressure and regulatory engagement; this decision marked a material change of course relative to earlier reports, though tensions persisted over balancing investor returns with ethical constraints. These changes highlighted causal frictions between OpenAI's scaling imperatives—fueled by compute-intensive AI development—and governance mechanisms intended to mitigate risks like unchecked power concentration.\n### Worldcoin Ethical and Privacy Issues\n\nWorldcoin, co-founded by Sam Altman in 2019, collects iris scans via proprietary \"Orb\" devices to generate unique cryptographic identifiers for proof-of-personhood verification, enabling distribution of its WLD cryptocurrency tokens to users. This process has elicited widespread privacy concerns, as iris biometrics constitute highly sensitive personal data that cannot be changed if compromised, unlike passwords, raising fears of long-term surveillance or identity theft. Critics, including privacy advocates, have highlighted inadequate data minimization and retention policies, with the project's storage of over 5 million iris images by mid-2023 amplifying risks of unauthorized access or misuse. \n\nEthical criticisms center on consent practices, where operators have been accused of pressuring low-income individuals in developing regions—such as Kenya, Indonesia, and parts of Latin America—with small token incentives equivalent to $2–$50, often without fully explaining data implications or alternatives. An MIT Technology Review investigation in 2022 documented deceptive recruitment tactics, including false promises of future payments and coercion in areas with limited literacy or digital access, prompting comparisons to exploitative data harvesting akin to bribery. In response, Worldcoin claims voluntary participation and data deletion options, but independent analyses question the validity of consent given economic disparities and opaque terms. \n\nRegulatory backlash has intensified globally. Kenya's High Court ruled in May 2025 that Worldcoin violated data protection laws by lacking impact assessments, obtaining invalid consent via inducements, and enabling unlawful cross-border transfers, ordering a halt to operations and data deletion for 1.5 million scans.  Similar actions include Spain's precautionary measures in March 2024 ordering a temporary halt to iris scanning for breaching EU data rules, South Korea's fines totaling approximately $800,000 in September 2024 for mishandling sensitive information, Hong Kong's determination of ordinance violations in May 2024, and Colombia's August 2024 accusations of uninformed consent and excessive processing, leading to a shutdown order.   Thailand raided over 100 sites in October 2025 for unlicensed biometric exchanges, while Germany suspended scans in July 2025 amid legal challenges.  These interventions underscore systemic failures in compliance with frameworks like GDPR and local biometric laws, with no reported data breaches to date but persistent warnings of inherent vulnerabilities in centralized iris databases.  Worldcoin has paused features like image sharing and pledged enhanced verification, yet skeptics argue these measures inadequately address core risks of biometric permanence and potential state or corporate overreach.\n### Debates on Accelerationism vs. Caution in AI Development\n\nSam Altman has articulated a position that balances rapid AI advancement with risk mitigation, contrasting with both unbridled accelerationism and calls for significant slowdowns. In March 2023, he endorsed the Future of Life Institute's open letter urging a six-month pause on training AI models surpassing GPT-4's capabilities, to enable development of shared safety protocols amid concerns over uncontrolled risks. By April 2023, however, Altman distanced himself from the letter's prescriptive halt, agreeing on the need for enhanced safety but arguing that pausing progress was impractical and that labs should prioritize verifiable safeguards during continued development.\n\nAltman's views align partially with effective accelerationism (e/acc), a movement promoting unconstrained technological propulsion to unlock superintelligence's transformative potential, as opposed to effective altruism's (EA) heavier emphasis on alignment and existential risk reduction. While not a committed e/acc adherent, Altman has critiqued decelerationist stances—such as those prioritizing indefinite slowdowns—for underestimating AI's net benefits and overfocusing on speculative harms, advocating instead for empirical progress testing safety measures in real time. His May 2023 endorsement of a Center for AI Safety statement framing AI extinction risks alongside pandemics and nuclear threats underscored his recognition of severe downsides, yet he has maintained that slowing capability gains could heighten risks by ceding advantages to less scrupulous actors.\n\nThe November 2023 OpenAI board upheaval highlighted these tensions, with Altman's brief ouster attributed by supporters to EA-influenced caution from figures like Ilya Sutskever, who prioritized superalignment over speed. E/acc advocates, including Marc Andreessen, rallied behind Altman, interpreting the board's action as an attempt to decelerate amid OpenAI's capped-profit structure favoring safety. Upon reinstatement, Altman reaffirmed investments in safety teams but accelerated compute pursuits, such as seeking trillions in funding for domestic chip production, which critics from EA circles contend undermines prior arguments that deliberate slowdowns minimize existential threats by limiting raw power.\n\nAltman's stance draws fire from purists on both sides: accelerationists fault OpenAI's internal safety overheads as veiled deceleration, while caution advocates, including former board members, decry his governance shifts toward profit-driven scaling as prioritizing velocity over verifiable alignment. He counters that hybrid approaches—scaling capabilities alongside iterative safeguards—best navigate uncertainties, warning in congressional testimony and public forums that neither regulatory overreach nor unchecked haste suffices, but democratic oversight paired with innovation sustains long-term viability.\n\n## Personal Life and Philanthropy\n\n### Relationships and Private Matters\n\nAltman publicly disclosed his homosexuality at age 17 during high school, speaking out after some students objected to a National Coming Out Day event. In January 2024, he married his long-term partner, Australian software engineer Oliver Mulherin, in a private seaside ceremony at their estate in Hawaii, attended by a small group of family and friends. The couple, who met toward the end of prior relationships and share interests in technology, reside primarily in San Francisco's Russian Hill neighborhood.\n\nOn February 22, 2025, Altman and Mulherin welcomed their first child, a son, via surrogacy; the newborn was premature and required care in a neonatal intensive care unit. Altman described the experience as profoundly transformative, stating it had \"neurochemically hacked\" him and expressing intentions for a large family.\n\nIn January 2025, Altman's younger sister, Ann Altman, filed a lawsuit in Missouri alleging repeated sexual abuse by him from 1997 to 2006 during their childhood; Altman denied the claims, calling them \"utterly untrue.\" The suit seeks damages for alleged emotional distress and other harms, amid reports of longstanding family estrangement. No criminal charges have been filed, and the matter remains in civil litigation as of October 2025.\n\n### Philanthropic Efforts and Effective Altruism Ties\n\nAltman joined the Giving Pledge on May 28, 2024, committing alongside his husband, Oliver Mulherin, to donate the majority of their wealth to charitable causes during their lifetimes or via their wills. His net worth at the time was estimated at approximately $1 billion to $2 billion, primarily from investments in startups. Prior to this pledge, Altman's publicly documented philanthropic contributions were modest; in 2015, he pledged $10 million to establish YC Research, a Y Combinator initiative focused on long-term technological projects.\n\nIn 2016, Altman helped fund an experimental universal basic income (UBI) study through OpenResearch, a nonprofit laboratory. By July 2024, the project had distributed $45 million in cash payments—up to $1,000 monthly—to thousands of lower-income U.S. households over several years, with Altman personally contributing $14 million via a $25 million line of credit and OpenAI's nonprofit arm providing an additional $10 million. The study aimed to assess the impacts of unconditional cash transfers on employment, health, and well-being, yielding data showing recipients increased spending on food, entertainment, and alcohol but experienced no significant job loss.\n\nAltman's ties to effective altruism (EA) stem primarily from the origins of OpenAI, which he co-founded in 2015 with an explicit focus on developing artificial general intelligence (AGI) safely to mitigate existential risks—a priority central to EA's emphasis on longtermism and catastrophe prevention. OpenAI received at least $30 million from Open Philanthropy, an EA-aligned grantmaker, to support its safety research. However, Altman's personal alignment with EA has been inconsistent; while early involvement reflected shared concerns over AI risks, he later described the movement as \"incredibly flawed\" and exhibiting \"very weird emergent behavior,\" particularly amid internal OpenAI governance tensions influenced by EA-linked board members. No major personal donations from Altman to core EA organizations, such as those recommended by GiveWell for global health interventions, have been publicly detailed.",
