## Introduction

Michelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni, commonly known as Michelangelo (March 6, 1475 – February 18, 1564), was an Italian sculptor, painter, architect, and poet of the High Renaissance. Born in the Republic of Florence, Michelangelo is widely regarded as one of the greatest artists in Western history. His contributions to art and architecture, including masterpieces like the statue of *David*, the Sistine Chapel ceiling, and the design of St. Peter’s Basilica, have left an indelible mark on the cultural landscape of Europe. Often described as the archetype of the "Renaissance Man," Michelangelo’s versatility and genius transcended multiple disciplines, influencing generations of artists and thinkers [Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Michelangelo).

## Historical Background

Michelangelo was born in Caprese, a small town in Tuscany, to a family of modest means. His father, Ludovico Buonarroti, was a local magistrate, but financial struggles led the family to move to Florence shortly after Michelangelo's birth. At a young age, he showed an inclination toward art, and at 13, he was apprenticed to the painter Domenico Ghirlandaio. This early training exposed him to the techniques of fresco painting and the artistic milieu of Florence, a hub of Renaissance innovation [Met Museum](https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/mich/hd_mich.htm).

In 1490, Michelangelo joined the household of Lorenzo de’ Medici, the powerful ruler of Florence and a prominent patron of the arts. Under Lorenzo’s patronage, Michelangelo studied classical sculpture and mingled with intellectuals like Marsilio Ficino and Poliziano, shaping his humanistic outlook. After Lorenzo’s death in 1492, Michelangelo worked in Bologna and Rome, where he created early masterpieces like the *Pietà* (1498–1499), a marble sculpture of Mary cradling the body of Jesus, now housed in St. Peter’s Basilica [Vatican Museums](https://www.museivaticani.va/content/museivaticani/en/collezioni/musei/la-pieta-di-michelangelo.html).

Michelangelo’s career flourished in the early 16th century. Returning to Florence, he sculpted the iconic *David* (1501–1504), a 17-foot marble statue symbolizing the city’s republican ideals and human potential. Commissioned by Pope Julius II, he later painted the Sistine Chapel ceiling (1508–1512), a monumental work depicting scenes from the Book of Genesis, including the famous *Creation of Adam*. Despite physical and emotional challenges, Michelangelo continued to produce significant works, including the *Last Judgment* fresco (1536–1541) in the Sistine Chapel and architectural designs for St. Peter’s Basilica, where he served as chief architect from 1546 until his death [History.com](https://www.history.com/topics/renaissance/michelangelo).
