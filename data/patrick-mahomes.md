# Patrick Mahomes

Patrick Lavon Mahomes II (born September 17, 1995) is an American football quarterback for the Kansas City Chiefs of the National Football League (NFL). Selected tenth overall in the 2017 NFL Draft after playing college football at Texas Tech University, Mahomes became the Chiefs' starting quarterback in 2018 and has since led the team to three Super Bowl victories—LIV in 2020, LVII in 2023, and LVIII in 2024—earning Super Bowl Most Valuable Player honors in each game. His professional accomplishments include two NFL Most Valuable Player Awards (2018 and 2022), two NFL Offensive Player of the Year Awards, and six Pro Bowl selections, establishing him as a dominant figure in the league through exceptional arm talent, mobility, and decision-making under pressure. Entering his ninth NFL season in 2025 at age 30, Mahomes holds franchise records for passing yards, touchdowns, and wins as a starter, with a career playoff record of 17-4 as of late 2024.

## Early life and amateur career

### Family background and upbringing

Patrick Mahomes was born on September 17, 1995, in Tyler, Texas, to Pat Mahomes Sr. and Randi Martin. His father, Patrick Lavon Mahomes Sr., born August 9, 1970, in Bryan, Texas, pursued a professional baseball career as a right-handed pitcher, debuting in Major League Baseball with the Minnesota Twins on April 29, 1992, and playing 11 seasons across six teams, including the Texas Rangers and Chicago Cubs, through 2003, while accumulating 215 strikeouts in 284 appearances. Pat Mahomes Sr. continued in minor leagues and independent ball until 2009, exposing the family to a nomadic athletic lifestyle early on, though Patrick primarily grew up in East Texas.

Randi Martin, Patrick's mother, supported the family through her son's formative years, emphasizing a sports-centric environment; she and Pat Sr. married in the late 1990s and divorced in 2006 when Patrick was 11, after which Randi raised him primarily in Tyler and nearby Whitehouse, Texas. The couple had two sons together: Patrick and younger brother Jackson, born in 2000, who shared a close bond growing up in Tyler. Patrick also has four younger half-siblings from his parents' subsequent relationships, including sister Mia, contributing to a blended family dynamic centered on athletic pursuits.

Mahomes' upbringing was marked by his father's professional sports influence, fostering early exposure to competition; Pat Sr.'s MLB tenure, which included a 5.47 career ERA and stints in 15 minor league clubs over 22 years, instilled discipline and resilience, as Patrick often attended games and trained alongside his father. Raised in a biracial household—his father Black and mother white—Mahomes developed in Whitehouse, Texas, where family support emphasized multi-sport participation from youth, laying the groundwork for his versatile athleticism without formal early specialization.

### High school achievements

Mahomes attended Whitehouse High School in Whitehouse, Texas, participating in football, baseball, and basketball as a three-sport athlete.

In football, he emerged as the starting quarterback during his junior year in 2012, passing for 3,839 yards and 46 touchdowns with nine interceptions. As a senior in 2013, Mahomes completed 287 of 495 passes for 4,619 yards and 50 touchdowns, adding 948 rushing yards and 15 rushing touchdowns on 157 carries, for a combined 65 total touchdowns; these performances helped Whitehouse secure its first district championship in school history. In his final high school game, a playoff loss to Mesquite Poteet on November 15, 2013, he threw for over 600 yards.

For his senior season dominance, Mahomes was named the Texas Associated Press Sports Editors High School Football Player of the Year, the Associated Press Class 4A Offensive Player of the Year, and the MaxPreps National Male Athlete of the Year for 2013–14.

### College recruitment and Texas Tech

Patrick Mahomes attended Whitehouse High School in Whitehouse, Texas, where he played quarterback and demonstrated versatility across sports. As a senior in 2013, he completed 58% of his passes for 4,619 yards and 50 touchdowns, while rushing for 948 yards and 15 touchdowns on 157 carries, contributing to Whitehouse's first district championship. Despite these performances, which included leading the nation with 5,559 total yards, Mahomes was evaluated as a three-star recruit, ranked 389th overall and 30th among quarterbacks in the class of 2014 by 247Sports.

Mahomes received scholarship offers solely from in-state programs Texas Tech, Rice, and Houston, with no out-of-state schools extending formal scholarships despite reported interest from TCU, West Virginia, Oklahoma State, Miami, and LSU. Texas Tech, under head coach Kliff Kingsbury, offered him the quarterback position in an air raid offense that emphasized passing, aligning with Mahomes' strong arm and improvisational style. The program's willingness to accommodate his baseball aspirations—stemming from his father's MLB career and Mahomes' own draft selection by the Detroit Tigers in the 37th round of the 2014 MLB Draft—further influenced his decision, though he prioritized football.

On April 21, 2013, Mahomes verbally committed to Texas Tech, an early pledge that reflected the limited competition for his services. He signed his national letter of intent on National Signing Day in February 2014, forgoing MLB pursuits to enroll at Texas Tech that fall. At Texas Tech, Mahomes initially planned dual-sport participation, appearing in one baseball game as a pitcher in 2015, but focused primarily on football development.

## College career

### Freshman and sophomore seasons

Mahomes entered the 2014 season as a true freshman backup to senior quarterback Davis Webb at Texas Tech. He appeared in seven games, starting four, and completed 105 of 185 passes for 1,547 yards, 16 touchdowns, and four interceptions. His most notable performance came on November 29 against Baylor, where he threw for a Big 12 freshman record 598 yards in a 48-46 loss, despite the team's 2-10 record that season. Mahomes also started against Texas on November 1 but suffered a head injury, limiting his further play.

In his 2015 sophomore season, Mahomes assumed the full-time starting role, appearing in all 13 games. He passed for 4,653 yards on 364 of 573 attempts (63.5% completion), throwing 36 touchdowns against 15 interceptions, while adding 456 rushing yards. These figures placed him fourth nationally in passing yards per game at 358.0. Texas Tech improved to a 7-5 regular-season record under his leadership, though the team lost in the Arizona Bowl. Mahomes' dual-threat ability was evident, as he ranked among the nation's top quarterbacks in total offense.

### Junior season and decision to enter NFL Draft

In the 2016 season, Patrick Mahomes's junior year at Texas Tech, he demonstrated exceptional passing efficiency and volume, completing 388 of 591 attempts for 5,052 yards and 41 touchdowns with 10 interceptions, achieving a passer rating of 157.0. These figures contributed to 5,052 passing yards and marked the second consecutive season in which he surpassed 5,000 total offensive yards, averaging 444.8 yards of total offense per game across 12 appearances. Despite Texas Tech's 5-7 overall record, Mahomes's individual output ranked him among NCAA leaders, including sixth in single-season passing yards in FBS history at the time.

Mahomes produced several standout performances, including a school-record 734 passing yards on 52 completions from 88 attempts in a 66-59 loss to Oklahoma on November 26, 2016, a game that set a college football record for combined quarterback passing yards at 1,708 with opponent Baker Mayfield. He threw for over 300 yards in nine of 12 games and at least 400 yards in six contests, showcasing arm strength and improvisational skills in Texas Tech's air raid offense. For his efforts, Mahomes received the 2016 Sammy Baugh Trophy, awarded to the nation's top passer, recognizing his statistical dominance despite the team's lack of success.

Following the season, on January 3, 2017, Mahomes declared his intention to forgo his senior year and apply for early entry into the 2017 NFL Draft, citing his readiness for professional competition after a breakout campaign that elevated his prospect status. This decision came amid evaluations highlighting his athleticism and arm talent, though scouts noted potential challenges in adapting his high-volume college style—characterized by frequent downfield attempts and mobility—to structured NFL defenses. His junior-year production, including leading the nation in total offense early in the season, positioned him as a first-round candidate despite operating in a pass-heavy system that inflated raw numbers but revealed real arm velocity and escapability.

### College statistics and accolades

Patrick Mahomes compiled 11,252 passing yards, 93 passing touchdowns, and 29 interceptions over three seasons at Texas Tech, completing 857 of 1,349 passes for a 63.6% rate. He also rushed for 1,068 yards and 22 touchdowns on 308 carries, contributing to a career total offense of 12,320 yards. His dual-threat ability was evident, particularly in 2015 and 2016, when he led the Big 12 in total offense.

In 2016, Mahomes led the FBS in passing yards (5,052) and total offense (5,312 yards), setting Texas Tech single-season records for passing yards and touchdowns while throwing for over 500 yards in five games, a school record. He earned the Sammy Baugh Trophy, awarded to the nation's top passer, after ranking first nationally in multiple passing categories. Mahomes was named second-team All-Big 12 by both coaches and media in 2016, and received honorable mention honors in 2014 and 2015. 

He was recognized as Big 12 Offensive Player of the Week three times during the 2016 season and finished as a semifinalist for the Maxwell Award and Davey O'Brien Award. As a freshman in 2014, Mahomes set a Big 12 record for single-game passing yards by a freshman with 598 against Baylor.

## Professional career

### 2017 NFL Draft and rookie season

The Kansas City Chiefs selected Mahomes in the first round, tenth overall, of the 2017 NFL Draft held on April 27 in Philadelphia, after trading up from the 27th pick by sending their first-round selection (27th overall), a third-round pick (91st overall), and a 2018 first-round pick to the Buffalo Bills. Pre-draft evaluations highlighted Mahomes's exceptional arm strength and athleticism but noted concerns over his unconventional throwing mechanics, tendency to freelance outside structured plays, and adaptation from Texas Tech's wide-open offense, projecting him as a high-upside but raw prospect requiring significant coaching. At the NFL Scouting Combine, Mahomes measured 6 feet 2 inches tall and 225 pounds, ran a 4.80-second 40-yard dash, and opted not to throw due to a lingering knee issue from college, focusing instead on interviews and athletic testing.

Mahomes signed a four-year rookie contract with the Chiefs on July 20, 2017, valued at $16.4 million fully guaranteed, including a $10 million signing bonus. As a rookie, he served as the backup quarterback to Alex Smith under head coach Andy Reid, who emphasized a deliberate development plan involving extensive film study and practice repetitions to refine his footwork, decision-making, and pocket presence without immediate game pressure.

Mahomes appeared in one regular-season game during the 2017 campaign, entering in the fourth quarter of the Chiefs' Week 17 victory over the Denver Broncos on December 31, where he completed his only pass attempt for 17 yards to wide receiver Albert Wilson. He recorded no touchdowns or interceptions in limited action, finishing the season with a 77.1 passer rating across one game played, while the Chiefs ended with a 10-6 record and qualified for the playoffs as AFC West champions.

### 2018 breakout season

Mahomes entered the 2018 season as the Kansas City Chiefs' starting quarterback after the team agreed to trade incumbent starter Alex Smith to the Washington Redskins on January 30, 2018, with the deal finalized on March 14, 2018. Under head coach Andy Reid's no-huddle offense, Mahomes demonstrated exceptional arm strength, accuracy, and improvisational ability, often extending plays with mobility. In the first eight games, he threw 26 touchdown passes for 2,526 yards and a 115.3 passer rating, leading the Chiefs to a 5–3 start marked by high-scoring outputs, including a 42–40 comeback win over the Baltimore Ravens on September 23 where he threw for 377 yards and three touchdowns in the second half alone.

Over the full regular season, Mahomes appeared in all 16 games, starting each, and completed 383 of 580 passes for 5,097 yards, 50 touchdowns, and 12 interceptions, posting a league-leading 113.8 passer rating and 66.0 completion percentage.  His 50 touchdown passes established a new NFL single-season record, surpassing the previous high of 48 shared by Peyton Manning (2013) and Tom Brady (2007), while his total offensive touchdowns (50 passing plus two rushing) set another league mark. These figures propelled the Chiefs to a 12–4 record and the AFC West title, with Mahomes earning Associated Press NFL Most Valuable Player honors—the youngest winner since Dan Marino in 1984—along with Offensive Player of the Year, Pro Bowl selection, and First-Team All-Pro recognition. 

In the playoffs, the Chiefs secured the No. 2 seed and a first-round bye. Mahomes went 21-for-27 for 214 yards with zero touchdowns or interceptions in a 31–13 divisional-round victory over the Indianapolis Colts on January 6, 2019, relying on efficient short passes and team defense. However, in the AFC Championship Game against the New England Patriots on January 20, 2019, he completed 37 of 50 passes for 295 yards and three touchdowns but threw two costly interceptions, contributing to a 37–31 overtime loss after leading 14–3 early. His postseason play highlighted both his ceiling for explosive production and areas for refinement in high-stakes protection of the ball.

### 2019 season and first Super Bowl appearance

In the 2019 regular season, Patrick Mahomes started 14 games for the Kansas City Chiefs, completing 319 of 484 passes for 4,031 yards, 26 touchdowns, and five interceptions with a 105.3 passer rating. The Chiefs finished with a 12–4 record, winning the AFC West division and earning the second seed in the AFC playoffs.

In the divisional round on January 12, 2020, the Chiefs hosted the Houston Texans and overcame a 24–0 deficit to win 51–31. Mahomes completed 23 of 35 passes for 321 yards and five touchdowns with no interceptions. One week later, in the AFC Championship Game against the Tennessee Titans on January 19, Kansas City prevailed 35–24 after trailing 17–7 at halftime; Mahomes went 27 of 42 for 295 yards and three passing touchdowns, while adding 53 rushing yards and a 27-yard rushing touchdown.

The Chiefs advanced to Super Bowl LIV against the San Francisco 49ers on February 2, 2020, at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida, marking their first appearance in the game since 1970. Trailing 20–10 with 6:13 left in the fourth quarter, Mahomes led drives resulting in 21 unanswered points for a 31–20 victory, securing Kansas City's first Super Bowl title in franchise history. He completed 26 of 42 passes for 286 yards and two touchdowns with two interceptions, and rushed six times for 29 yards including a one-yard touchdown run.

### 2020 season

In the 2020 regular season, Patrick Mahomes completed 390 of 588 passes for 4,740 yards, 38 touchdowns, and six interceptions, achieving a 66.3% completion rate and 101.0 passer rating across 15 games. These figures propelled the Kansas City Chiefs to a 14–2 record and the AFC's No. 1 seed, securing a first-round bye in the playoffs. Mahomes missed one game due to a concussion sustained against the Denver Broncos on November 1, 2020. For his performance, he received the Associated Press NFL Most Valuable Player Award, the Hickok Belt, and other honors recognizing his efficiency and volume production despite the shortened schedule from COVID-19 protocols.

In the playoffs, Mahomes guided the Chiefs through two victories before a Super Bowl defeat. On January 17, 2021, in the divisional round against the Pittsburgh Steelers, he threw for 265 yards and four touchdowns in a 42–21 win, though he suffered a turf toe injury on his right foot early in the game. The injury persisted into the AFC Championship Game on January 24 versus the Cleveland Browns, a 22–17 victory where Mahomes passed for 275 yards and one touchdown with no interceptions, relying on mobility limitations and team defense to advance. In Super Bowl LV on February 7 against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Mahomes completed 21 of 39 passes for 270 yards and two touchdowns with no interceptions in a 31–9 loss, hampered by the aggravated toe injury that reduced his scrambling effectiveness. Overall, Mahomes recorded 850 passing yards, four touchdowns, and two interceptions in three playoff games, with a 90.8 passer rating.

### 2021 season

Mahomes led the Chiefs to a 12-5 regular season record, securing the AFC West division title for the sixth consecutive year. Despite early-season injuries to key offensive linemen and running back Clyde Edwards-Helaire, the team maintained a potent passing attack, with Mahomes completing 436 of 658 passes for 4,839 yards, 37 touchdowns, and 12 interceptions, achieving a 66.3% completion rate and a 103.5 passer rating. He also contributed 264 rushing yards and one touchdown on 46 carries, extending his reputation for dual-threat capability.

The season began with three straight wins, including a 20-17 victory over the Cleveland Browns on September 12 where Mahomes threw for 360 yards and three touchdowns. However, a Week 2 loss to the Baltimore Ravens on September 28 resulted in Mahomes sustaining a high ankle sprain after being tackled awkwardly by defensive end Calais Campbell, an injury that hampered his mobility for several weeks despite him avoiding the injured reserve list. The Chiefs then endured a three-game losing streak amid broader offensive line woes, scoring just 42 points across defeats to the Los Angeles Chargers (30-24 OT on October 10), Buffalo Bills (38-20 on October 19), and Washington Football Team (31-13 on October 17), exposing vulnerabilities in pass protection as Mahomes faced increased pressure. Kansas City rebounded with eight wins in their final ten games, highlighted by a 31-0 shutout of the Las Vegas Raiders on November 21 where Mahomes passed for 286 yards and three touchdowns without an interception.

In the playoffs, the Chiefs hosted the Pittsburgh Steelers in the Wild Card round on January 16, 2022, dominating with a 42-21 victory as Mahomes threw for 404 yards and five touchdowns on 30 of 39 attempts, no interceptions. They advanced to the divisional round against the Buffalo Bills on January 23 in extreme weather conditions, rallying from a 26-3 halftime deficit and three halftime lead changes in overtime to win 42-36, with Mahomes completing 25 of 40 passes for 378 yards and three touchdowns. The run ended in the AFC Championship Game against the Cincinnati Bengals on January 30, where a late Bengals touchdown forced overtime; after Kansas City scored a touchdown to open the extra period, Bengals kicker Evan McPherson tied it with a 31-yard field goal, but Cincinnati's Joe Burrow led a game-winning drive ending in a touchdown, resulting in a 27-24 loss despite Mahomes' 275 yards and three touchdowns on 29 of 39 passing. Overall in the postseason, Mahomes amassed 1,057 passing yards, 11 touchdowns, and three interceptions across three games, posting a 118.8 passer rating.

### 2022 season

Mahomes led the Kansas City Chiefs to a 14–3 regular season record, securing the AFC West division title for the eighth consecutive year and the top seed in the AFC playoffs. Despite challenges including an inconsistent offensive line and injuries to key receivers, his performance anchored the offense, which ranked first in points scored per game at 29.2.

In 17 games, Mahomes completed 435 of 648 passes for 5,250 yards, 41 touchdowns, and 12 interceptions, achieving a 67.1% completion rate and 105.2 passer rating. He added 358 rushing yards on 61 carries with four rushing touchdowns, contributing to his NFL-record fifth consecutive season with over 5,000 total yards from scrimmage. For these efforts, Mahomes earned First-Team All-Pro honors, his fifth Pro Bowl selection, and the Associated Press NFL Most Valuable Player award, capturing 48 of 50 first-place votes.

Entering the playoffs as the AFC's top seed, the Chiefs defeated the Jacksonville Jaguars 27–20 in the divisional round on January 21, 2023, despite Mahomes suffering a high ankle sprain late in the game after a scramble. He returned for the next series, completing 17 of 23 passes for 195 yards and two touchdowns while rushing for 29 yards. Playing through the injury without missing time, Mahomes guided Kansas City to a 23–20 overtime victory over the Cincinnati Bengals in the AFC Championship Game on January 29, then threw for 182 yards and three touchdowns in a 38–35 win over the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl LVII on February 12, 2023, earning his second Super Bowl MVP award.

### 2023 season

In the 2023 regular season, Mahomes started all 16 games for the Kansas City Chiefs, completing 401 of 597 passes for 4,183 yards, 27 touchdowns, and 14 interceptions, achieving a passer rating of 92.6. He also rushed for 389 yards on 75 carries with no rushing touchdowns, contributing to the Chiefs' ground game amid offensive line and receiver inconsistencies. The team finished with an 11-6 record, securing the AFC West title for the eighth consecutive year despite ranking 15th in points scored (371 total, 21.8 per game).

The season featured early promise with a 9-3 start, highlighted by a 41-10 season-opening win over the Detroit Lions on September 7, where Mahomes threw for 215 yards and a touchdown. However, a mid-season slump included three straight losses—to the Philadelphia Eagles (October 22), Denver Broncos (October 29, Mahomes' first career loss to Denver), and Green Bay Packers (November 5 in Germany)—exposing wide receiver drop issues, with the unit leading the NFL in drops (28 total).  Mahomes later described the year as lacking enjoyment due to these execution failures, including a career-low 7.7 yards per attempt when targeting wide receivers (20th in the NFL) and the team's 11 lost fumbles.

A late surge propelled Kansas City to the playoffs as the AFC's No. 3 seed, with Mahomes earning his sixth Pro Bowl selection but finishing outside the top tier for MVP consideration amid the statistical dip from prior years. The Chiefs' defense, allowing just 17.3 points per game (fourth-fewest in the league), compensated for offensive inefficiencies, enabling postseason entry.

In the playoffs, Mahomes guided the Chiefs to victories over the Houston Texans (January 13, 2024; 27-17, with 355 yards and a touchdown despite an ankle sprain) and Buffalo Bills (January 21; 27-24, overcoming a late deficit with clutch drives). They advanced past the Baltimore Ravens in the AFC Championship (January 28; 17-10), where Mahomes threw for 241 yards and a touchdown, setting up the Super Bowl matchup.

### 2024 season and Super Bowl LVIII

Super Bowl LVIII, held on February 11, 2024, at Allegiant Stadium in Paradise, Nevada, saw the Kansas City Chiefs defeat the San Francisco 49ers 25–22 in the first overtime game in Super Bowl history. Mahomes completed 34 of 46 passes for 333 yards and two touchdowns, with one interception. He added 66 rushing yards on nine carries, including a 3-yard touchdown run in overtime that secured the victory. For his efforts, Mahomes was named Super Bowl Most Valuable Player, marking his third such award.

Following the Super Bowl victory, Mahomes led the Chiefs into the 2024 regular season as the defending champions. He started all 16 games, completing 392 of 581 pass attempts for 3,928 yards, 26 touchdowns, and 11 interceptions, posting a 93.5 passer rating. Mahomes also contributed on the ground with 58 rushes for 307 yards and two touchdowns. His performance helped maintain the Chiefs' contention in the AFC West, though the team faced challenges with offensive line issues and receiver inconsistencies.

### 2025 season (ongoing)

The Kansas City Chiefs began the 2025 NFL regular season with a 0–2 record for the first time since 2014, including a 21–27 home loss to the Los Angeles Chargers on September 5. The team rebounded with consecutive victories, defeating the New York Giants and Baltimore Ravens, the latter on September 28 in a 37–20 win where Mahomes threw for 270 yards and four touchdowns. A 28–31 road upset loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars on October 6 dropped the Chiefs to 2–3 before they secured wins against the Detroit Lions—highlighted by Mahomes' strongest performance of the season to date—and the Las Vegas Raiders on October 20, improving to 4–3 and placing second in the AFC West. 

Through seven games, Mahomes has recorded 1,800 passing yards, 14 touchdowns, and two interceptions, ranking fourth league-wide in yards and third in total quarterback rating at 77.9. His efficiency has been bolstered by low turnover production, with the interceptions limited to early-season miscues, while the Chiefs' offense averages 26.6 points per game, supported by a defense allowing just 17.7 points. Notable plays include a Week 7 trick play against the Raiders that negated a potential sack and a three-touchdown outing in that 31-point victory. Mahomes has avoided significant injuries, maintaining full participation amid the team's push for a playoff return.

| **Career** | **21 (17–4)** | **511/755** | **5,814** | **46–10** | **105.4** | **606/7** |

These figures reflect Mahomes' efficiency in high-stakes games, where he has thrown multiple touchdown passes in 14 of his 21 starts and maintained a positive touchdown-to-interception ratio in six of seven postseason campaigns. His three Super Bowl victories (LIV, LVII, and LVIII) account for nine of those starts, during which he passed for 2,235 yards and 18 touchdowns against 3 interceptions.

### Advanced metrics and efficiency ratings

Patrick Mahomes has consistently ranked among the NFL's elite quarterbacks in advanced efficiency metrics, particularly adjusted net yards per attempt (ANY/A), where his career regular-season mark of 8.13 exceeds that of most peers with over 1,000 attempts, reflecting superior per-pass value after accounting for touchdowns, interceptions, and sacks. In the postseason, his ANY/A of 7.50 underscores maintained productivity in high-stakes environments. These figures derive from empirical play-by-play data, emphasizing causal contributions to scoring outcomes over raw volume statistics.

Mahomes also leads in clutch efficiency indicators, with 23 game-winning drives and 19 fourth-quarter comebacks through the 2024 season, metrics that quantify his impact in late-game scenarios beyond traditional passer ratings. His career passer rating of 102.1 further highlights this, though advanced variants like ESPN's Total QBR show variability, dipping to 64.6 in 2024 amid offensive line challenges and receiver adjustments, yet rebounding to 77.9 early in 2025.

In expected points added (EPA) per dropback, Mahomes has topped the league in multiple seasons, including 0.27 in 2022, a figure derived from situational play data that isolates quarterback decision-making from downstream factors like drops or defensive schemes. Pro Football Focus (PFF) grades reinforce his aggressive style, with career highs in big-time throws—such as 50 in 2020, second league-wide—measuring high-value, low-probability completions, though accompanied by elevated turnover-worthy plays (23 that year, top three). Recent PFF passing grades have trended lower, ranking 19th in 2025 amid scrutinized decisions, but historical aggregates place him in the 90+ range for execution under pressure.

| Metric | Career Regular Season | Postseason | Source |
|--------|-----------------------|------------|--------|
| ANY/A | 8.13 | 7.50 | PFR |
| Game-Winning Drives | 23 | 6 | PFR |

## Playing style and impact

### Physical attributes and skills

Patrick Mahomes measures 6 feet 2 inches in height and 225 pounds in weight.  His arm length is 33¼ inches, and hand size is 9¼ inches.  At the 2017 NFL Scouting Combine, Mahomes ran the 40-yard dash in 4.80 seconds. 

Mahomes demonstrates elite arm strength, with a recorded throwing velocity of 62 miles per hour.  Scouting evaluations describe his arm talent as exceptional, enabling passes with high velocity and touch at intermediate and long ranges.  He excels in delivering accurate throws from unconventional angles and off-platform positions, compensating for inconsistent footwork through natural athleticism. 

In terms of mobility, Mahomes possesses quick feet and elusiveness, allowing him to evade pressure and extend plays. His combine performance included a 3-cone drill time of 6.88 seconds and a 20-yard shuttle of 4.08 seconds, indicating above-average agility for a quarterback. These attributes contribute to his career rushing totals exceeding 3,000 yards and 30 touchdowns, underscoring functional athleticism beyond straight-line speed.

### Strategic influence on offense

Mahomes' exceptional arm strength, velocity, and accuracy from unconventional platforms have enabled Kansas City Chiefs head coach Andy Reid to incorporate more aggressive, improvisational elements into the offensive scheme, shifting from the prior conservative, timing-based passing attack under quarterback Alex Smith. Prior to Mahomes' 2018 starting role, the Chiefs ranked mid-tier in passing yards per game, emphasizing short, high-percentage throws; post-Mahomes, they led the NFL in scoring offense in three of his first six seasons as starter, averaging over 28 points per game from 2018 to 2023. This transformation stems from Mahomes' ability to execute off-script throws—such as sidearm lasers and no-look passes—that exploit defensive overcommitments, allowing Reid to design plays with built-in "scramble rules" where receivers adjust routes based on Mahomes' movement.

The Chiefs' scheme under Mahomes emphasizes pre-snap motion at the league's highest rate, providing him with real-time defensive intelligence to audible into favorable matchups, which has elevated third-down conversion rates to among the NFL's top five in multiple seasons. For instance, in 2025, Mahomes completed 74.3% of passes at 7.9 yards per attempt upon key receiver Rashee Rice's return, demonstrating how his quick processing and touch on intermediate routes sustain drives in motion-heavy sets. Reid has adapted by increasing run-option plays (RPOs) and designed quarterback runs, leveraging Mahomes' 250 rushing yards through seven games in 2025, which force defenses to divide coverage and open passing lanes—evident in the team's third-ranked rushing success rate of 47.9%. Mahomes' input during film sessions has further expanded the playbook, incorporating more deep-shot concepts after a 2024 dip, as he noted the need to rediscover explosive plays to counter defenses stacking the box.

This strategic reliance on Mahomes' dual-threat profile has influenced league-wide trends, prompting opponents to deploy extra rushers or spies, yet his low interception rate—two through seven games in 2025—highlights the causal edge his decision-making provides in high-variance situations. While recent adaptations toward a grind-it-out identity (11th in points per game early 2024) reflect personnel challenges like receiver injuries, Mahomes' capacity to convert third-and-longs sustains efficiency, with a 77.7 QBR ranking third league-wide in 2025. Analysts attribute this to his unquantifiable play-extending ability, which creates separation for teammates not fully captured in traditional metrics but verifiable through film breakdowns showing improvised yards after contact.

### Comparisons to historical quarterbacks

Patrick Mahomes has drawn comparisons to several historical quarterbacks due to his exceptional arm strength, improvisational ability, and rapid accumulation of playoff successes, including three Super Bowl victories in his first six seasons as a starter. Analysts frequently highlight his gunslinger mentality akin to Brett Favre, noting similarities in willingness to attempt high-risk throws, though Mahomes maintains a lower interception rate (2.0% career versus Favre's 3.0%) and higher completion percentage (66.6% versus 62.0%). Favre himself described Mahomes as a "river boat gambler" who embraces mistakes as part of aggressive play, echoing his own career style but with Mahomes demonstrating greater overall efficiency in passing metrics.

Comparisons to Tom Brady emphasize Mahomes' early dominance in championships and clutch performances, with Mahomes surpassing Brady's statistics through age 28 in passing yards (28,424 versus 27,443), touchdowns (218 versus 199), and playoff wins (12 versus 9). However, Brady's longevity—evidenced by seven Super Bowl wins and career records in passing yards (89,214) and touchdowns (649)—sets a benchmark Mahomes would need extended elite play to approach, as Mahomes' dynamic mobility contrasts with Brady's pocket-based precision. At age 30, Mahomes ranks ahead of Brady in per-game passing yards (240.1 versus 220.4) and has a higher career passer rating (102.1 versus 97.2), fueling debates on whether his trajectory positions him as a potential greatest of all time.

Mahomes' stylistic parallels to Aaron Rodgers include elite arm talent for off-platform throws and accuracy under pressure, yet Mahomes exceeds Rodgers in rushing production (3,921 career yards and 32 touchdowns versus Rodgers' 4,299 yards and 33, but with Mahomes achieving this in fewer games) and postseason efficiency, boasting a 15-3 playoff record compared to Rodgers' 11-10. Analysts note Rodgers' prime featured superior first-down conversion rates on passes (41.8% versus Mahomes' 41.4%), but Mahomes' dual-threat capability has yielded more Super Bowl appearances relative to seasons played. These distinctions underscore Mahomes' hybrid profile, blending Rodgers-like precision with greater mobility not matched by most pocket passers in history.

While some rankings place Mahomes among the top three all-time quarterbacks behind only Brady and Joe Montana based on his first seven seasons' Pro Bowl selections (6), MVP awards (2), and adjusted net yards per attempt (8.1, leading qualifiers), such assessments remain premature without sustained performance over two decades. His unique fusion of skills—improvisation, velocity, and decision-making—defies direct equivalence to predecessors, influencing evaluations of modern quarterbacks beyond traditional metrics.

## Criticisms and controversies

### On-field conduct and officiating disputes

Mahomes has drawn criticism for on-field actions perceived as gamesmanship, including faking slides to bait defenders into penalties and engaging officials to contest calls. During a Week 7 game against the Baltimore Ravens on October 20, 2024, Mahomes feigned running out of bounds before reversing direction, drawing a roughing penalty on Ravens linebacker Roquan Smith; observers described the maneuver as "snarky" and potentially setting a precedent for exploiting quarterback protection rules. Similar tactics, such as late slides or exaggerated reactions to contact, have fueled accusations that Mahomes prioritizes drawing flags over straightforward play, with some analysts arguing this erodes his reputation despite his athleticism.

The quarterback's interactions with referees have sparked disputes, notably in an October 6, 2025, matchup against the Jacksonville Jaguars, where Mahomes and teammates lobbied officials after a potential penalty was picked up, allowing a controversial touchdown; fans and media labeled this as "bullying" or "whining" to influence rulings. Mahomes has faced NFL fines for such conduct, including $50,000 in December 2023 for verbally abusing officials following a loss to the Buffalo Bills, and $14,069 in November 2024 for an unsportsmanlike "violent gesture" during a touchdown celebration against the same opponent.

Officiating controversies often center on roughing-the-passer penalties benefiting Mahomes due to his unorthodox throwing mechanics, such as releasing passes from the ground or after evading sacks, which increase incidental contact. In the January 18, 2025, divisional playoff win over the Houston Texans, two penalties were called: one on defensive end Will Anderson Jr. for forcible facemask contact during a sack attempt, extending a Chiefs drive, and another for unnecessary roughness after a late slide; referee Clay Martin justified the former as meeting roughing criteria for helmet-to-body leverage and facemask involvement, while the NFL later affirmed both calls as correct with no fines issued. Mahomes has received 36 roughing penalties across seven seasons, a figure attributed by some to his scrambling style rather than referee bias, though opponents and fans contend it reflects inconsistent enforcement favoring star quarterbacks.

These incidents have amplified broader narratives of referee favoritism toward the Chiefs, prompting league responses; in February 2025, officials rebutted conspiracy claims, emphasizing rule adherence, while Mahomes maintained he experiences penalties on both sides of plays and denied receiving undue protection. The NFL subsequently explored replay assistance for quarterback slides in response to such disputes, aiming to clarify intent and reduce ambiguity in real-time decisions.

### Accusations of gamesmanship and rule exploitation

Mahomes has been accused by opponents, analysts, and fans of exploiting NFL quarterback protection rules during scrambles, particularly by feigning an intent to run out of bounds before pulling up to bait defenders into late hits or roughing penalties. In a October 20, 2024, game against the San Francisco 49ers, video angles of a 33-yard run prompted widespread criticism that Mahomes deliberately used the sideline to draw a defender into illegal contact, with detractors labeling it as cheating via "soft rules." Similarly, during a January 18, 2025, playoff matchup versus the Houston Texans, Mahomes' maneuvers led to controversial roughing calls, defended by an NFL rules official but decried by observers as emblematic of rule-bending favoritism toward star quarterbacks. Dallas Cowboys linebacker Micah Parsons highlighted this tactic on December 9, 2024, arguing it provides an "unfair advantage" and urging the league to close the loophole, while noting that defenders face split-second decisions under threat of ejection.

Critics have also pointed to Mahomes' frequency of drawing roughing the passer penalties—reportedly 36 such calls across seven seasons—as evidence of exaggeration or selective enforcement, contrasting sharply with historical benchmarks like Tom Brady's 31 over 23 years and attributing it to gamesmanship rather than coincidence. Hall of Fame defensive end Chris Doleman echoed these sentiments on October 21, 2024, accusing Mahomes of taking advantage of overly protective rules by baiting hits that risk his own safety, contrary to the provisions' injury-prevention intent. Instances of alleged flopping surfaced prominently in a January 19, 2025, game, where Mahomes was penalized after appearing to embellish contact, drawing commentary from ESPN's Troy Aikman and fan outrage over referee bias; Mahomes responded by dismissing the claims but faced calls for an anti-flopping rule akin to basketball's.

Accusations extended to potential injury feigning, such as a December 15, 2024, contest against the Cleveland Browns where Mahomes limped off with an apparent ankle issue but returned unimpeded, leading fans and commentators to allege fakery aimed at gaining sympathy or rest without substitution. Mahomes has countered these narratives, maintaining that his actions constitute intelligent play within the rulebook rather than manipulation, though proponents of reform argue such tactics undermine competitive integrity by prioritizing deception over straightforward execution. No formal NFL sanctions have resulted from these specific exploitation claims, distinguishing them from unrelated fines Mahomes received, such as $14,069 on November 24, 2024, for a violent gesture unrelated to rule-bending.

### Family-related public incidents

In February 2023, Jackson Mahomes, brother of Patrick Mahomes, was involved in an altercation at Aspens Restaurant in Overland Park, Kansas, where he allegedly grabbed the restaurant owner by the neck on three occasions and forcibly kissed her without consent, while also accused of battery against a male employee by pushing him. He was arrested on May 3, 2023, and charged with three felony counts of aggravated sexual battery and one misdemeanor count of battery. Jackson Mahomes pleaded not guilty to all charges. In January 2024, prosecutors dismissed the three felony charges, citing the alleged victim's lack of cooperation and reluctance to proceed, leaving only the misdemeanor battery charge. On March 8, 2024, he was sentenced to six months of probation for the battery conviction, avoiding jail time.

Pat Mahomes Sr., father of Patrick Mahomes, has faced multiple driving while intoxicated (DWI) arrests. In 2018, he pleaded guilty to a DWI charge in Texas and was sentenced to 40 days in jail, served on weekends. On February 24, 2024, he was arrested for his third DWI in Tyler, Texas, after a traffic stop revealed a blood alcohol content of 0.23. Pat Mahomes Sr. pleaded guilty on August 27, 2024, receiving a sentence of 10 days in jail, five years of probation, 180 days of house arrest with electronic monitoring, and a $2,000 fine. He began serving the jail portion on October 21, 2024, in Smith County Jail. Patrick Mahomes publicly addressed the arrest, describing it as a difficult family matter but emphasizing support and the need for accountability.

## Personal life and off-field endeavors

### Marriage and family

Patrick Mahomes met Brittany Matthews at Whitehouse High School in Whitehouse, Texas, where both participated in athletics; she played soccer while he focused on football and baseball. The couple began dating during their high school years and maintained their relationship through college, with Mahomes attending Texas Tech University and Matthews at the University of Texas at Tyler. They became engaged in September 2020 and married on March 12, 2022, in a private ceremony in Maui, Hawaii, overlooking the ocean. 

Mahomes and Matthews have three children together. Their first child, daughter Sterling Skye Mahomes, was born on February 20, 2021. Their second child, son Patrick "Bronze" Lavon Mahomes III, was born on November 28, 2022. Their third child, daughter Golden Raye Mahomes, was born on January 12, 2025. The couple has adopted a metallic-themed naming convention for their children, reflecting Sterling (silver alloy), Bronze, and Golden.

Mahomes was born to former Major League Baseball pitcher Pat Mahomes Sr. and Randi Martin, who divorced in 2006; he has a younger brother, Jackson Mahomes, and several half-siblings, including half-sister Mia Randall from his mother's side and half-siblings Grant, Avery, and Zoe from his father's subsequent relationships.  The family maintains close ties, with Mahomes' parents frequently attending his games and supporting his career.

### Business investments and endorsements

Mahomes earns substantial income from endorsement deals with major brands, estimated at $28 million annually as of 2025. These include long-term partnerships with Adidas, for which he launched a signature shoe line in 2020; State Farm Insurance; Oakley eyewear; Subway; and Head \u0026 Shoulders shampoo. Additional deals encompass Nestlé, Hugo Boss apparel, Prime energy drinks, Molson Coors beverages signed in June 2024, and Panini America trading cards in April 2025. He also endorses regional entities like Hy-Vee grocery, Airshare private jets, CommunityAmerica Credit Union, and DraftKings sports betting.

In parallel, Mahomes has pursued equity investments across sports franchises and consumer products to build long-term wealth. He acquired a 1% ownership stake in the Kansas City Royals MLB team in 2019 through a group investment. Alongside Kansas City Chiefs teammates Travis Kelce and others, he holds minority equity in Sporting Kansas City of Major League Soccer and the Kansas City Current of the National Women's Soccer League, purchased in 2021. These local sports holdings align with his emphasis on community ties and diversification beyond football.

Mahomes expanded into food and beverage with a lead investment in Throne Sport Coffee in May 2024, becoming the second-largest stakeholder behind founder Anthony Fedele; the brand focuses on performance-oriented coffee products tied to his personal routine. He also invested in Whataburger fast-food franchises starting in 2020, leveraging family business acumen from his father's operations. In health and tech sectors, he became an investor and ambassador for Hyperice recovery equipment in 2020 and took stakes in Whoop wearable fitness trackers and Alpine Formula One racing. These ventures reflect a strategy prioritizing scalable, athlete-aligned industries over speculative assets.

### Philanthropic efforts

Patrick Mahomes established the 15 and the Mahomies Foundation in 2019 to support initiatives enhancing children's health, wellness, education, and access to resources in underserved communities. The foundation partners with organizations such as Boys \u0026 Girls Clubs of America, pledging $1,500 for each regular-season touchdown scored by Mahomes, which culminated in a $1.625 million contribution announced in a multi-year commitment.

Key programs include the Read For 15 initiative, promoting literacy among youth, and the Mahomies Scholarship Award, launched in 2025 to provide financial aid to 15 students from areas including Kansas City and Tyler, Texas. In November 2024, Mahomes supported the 15 and FARE campaign through the NFL's My Cause My Cleats program, raising awareness and funds for food allergy research and education in collaboration with Food Allergy Research \u0026 Education.

The foundation's annual gala has been a primary fundraising vehicle; the inaugural event in November 2019 raised over $600,000, with $225,000 distributed to 15 charities. The sixth annual gala on October 21, 2025, generated $1,508,000, immediately granted to 27 Kansas City-area charities focused on children's causes. In 2023, the foundation received additional recognition by winning Nationwide's Charity Challenge, highlighting its impact on youth development. Earlier efforts include August 2019 donations of Adidas sneakers to Texas high school athletes in need and partnerships like providing pet supplies to 15 Kansas City families via KC Pet Project.

### Public stances and media relations

Mahomes has consistently avoided endorsing political candidates, prioritizing voter engagement over partisanship. In April 2024, he stated during an interview that he does not wish to influence voters' choices in the presidential race, instead encouraging individuals to conduct their own research before casting ballots. He reiterated this position in September 2024 amid speculation about his wife's social media activity, emphasizing that his platform serves to promote registration and participation in elections rather than support specific figures. 

On social issues, Mahomes publicly affirmed support for the Black Lives Matter movement during a Super Bowl LIV press conference on February 2, 2020, responding affirmatively to a question on the topic and underscoring its relevance amid ongoing discussions on racial justice. This stance aligned with his involvement in broader social justice efforts, including advocacy through NFL platforms, which have been credited with amplifying awareness on equality and community issues.

While his wife Brittany Mahomes has faced scrutiny for liking pro-Donald Trump content on Instagram in August 2024, prompting backlash and speculation about family alignments, Mahomes himself has refrained from commenting on electoral preferences or defending specific ideologies, maintaining neutrality to avoid alienating fans.  In March 2025, he indicated a willingness to stand firm on personal beliefs without public apology, though he disclosed no details on those views.

Mahomes exhibits cooperative media relations, participating routinely in post-game and weekly press conferences to address performance, strategy, and team dynamics without notable conflicts.  His interactions often feature candid assessments of gameplay, as seen in October 2025 remarks following Chiefs victories, where he focused on collective improvements and execution. This approach has fostered a professional rapport with reporters, contrasting with more contentious athlete-media dynamics elsewhere in the NFL.
