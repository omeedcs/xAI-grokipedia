# Victoria Falls

Victoria Falls, known locally as **Mosi-oa-Tunya** ("the smoke that thunders"), is a waterfall on the Zambezi River situated on the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe. It spans a width of 1,708 metres, with an average depth of 100 metres and a maximum height of 108 metres at an altitude of 915 metres above mean sea level. Recognized as the world's largest sheet of falling water, the falls form when the Zambezi River plummets over a basalt plateau, creating a continuous curtain visible from up to 50 kilometres away due to its spray.

The falls' geological formation results from the river's incision through ancient basalt flows from volcanic activity, exposing joints and gorges that demonstrate ongoing erosion and river capture processes. First documented by Europeans in 1855 when Scottish missionary and explorer David Livingstone sighted it on 16 November and named it after Queen Victoria, the site had long been known to indigenous peoples, with evidence of ancient hunter-gatherer occupation including stone artefacts. Designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1989, Victoria Falls holds exceptional geomorphological value and supports high biodiversity, serving as a barrier between river ichthyofaunas and a breeding ground for species like the endangered Taita falcon.

The Zambezi's mean annual flow at the falls measures 1,100 cubic metres per second, with peak discharges reaching up to 10,000 cubic metres per second, driving the immense volume—up to 500 million litres per minute—that characterizes its spectacle.

## Physical Description

### Location and Geological Setting

Victoria Falls lies on the Zambezi River along the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe in southern Africa, at coordinates 17°55′29″ S, 25°51′30″ E. The river, originating in Zambia's Mwinilunga District, flows southeastward for approximately 2,700 kilometers before reaching the falls, where it descends abruptly from the upper Zambezi plateau into the Batoka Gorge. This position places the falls roughly 1,360 kilometers upstream from the Zambezi's mouth at the Indian Ocean, within a region of stable cratonic basement overlain by sedimentary and volcanic rocks.

Geologically, the falls occupy the edge of a vast basalt plateau formed by extensive Jurassic flood basalt eruptions associated with the breakup of Gondwana, part of the Karoo Large Igneous Province. The underlying rocks consist primarily of the Batoka Formation basalts, which cap layers of softer sandstones and form a resistant, near-horizontal sheet extending over 200 kilometers from the Botswana border near Kazungula to the Matetsi River confluence downstream. These basalts, dated to around 180-183 million years ago via argon-argon methods on samples from the plateau, exhibit columnar jointing from cooling contraction, with fissures often infilled by weaker sedimentary material that promotes differential erosion.

The structural setting reflects tectonic stability on the African Plate's interior, distant from active rifts, though the Zambezi's course has been shaped by ancient faulting and epeirogenic uplift that steepened the regional gradient. The plateau's flat topography results from prolonged subaerial weathering and erosion, interrupted by the river's incision at zones of weakness, such as east-west trending cracks in the basalt aligned with regional fracture patterns. This configuration enables the Zambezi to maintain a broad, meandering channel upstream before encountering the resistant lip, precipitating the falls' characteristic sheet-like drop.

### Dimensions and Hydrological Features

Victoria Falls spans a width of approximately 1,700 meters and reaches a maximum height of 108 meters, with the height varying along its extent due to the underlying basalt topography. The cataract drops into a narrow chasm measuring 25 to 75 meters across, which confines the descending water into a thin, continuous curtain rather than dispersing it broadly.

The hydrological regime is driven by the Zambezi River's discharge, which exhibits pronounced seasonal fluctuations tied to rainfall in its upper catchment spanning Angola, Zambia, and surrounding regions. Mean annual flow at the falls, based on historical gauging from 1924 to 1964, stands at 1,198 cubic meters per second, though inter-annual variability ranges from lows of around 400 m³/s in dry years to highs exceeding 2,300 m³/s in wet ones.  Peak flows occur from March to May following the November-to-April rainy season, reaching up to 10,000–12,800 m³/s, equivalent to roughly 500–700 million liters per minute, producing immense spray clouds visible from 50 kilometers away. 

During the dry season (June to October), flows drop to 200–300 m³/s, exposing large portions of the rock face, particularly on the Zambian side where eastern cataracts may cease entirely, while Zimbabwean sections maintain perennial flow. Recent decades have seen episodic record lows, such as in 2019 when discharge fell below the 1995 minimum due to prolonged drought and upstream variability, prompting hydrological monitoring by bodies like the Zambezi River Authority.  This variability underscores the falls' dependence on regional precipitation patterns, with no significant upstream dams directly altering the unregulated upper Zambezi flow at this point.

### Gorges and Structural Elements

The gorges downstream of Victoria Falls comprise a sequence of at least eight deep, zigzag chasms extending roughly 80 kilometers along the Zambezi River, known collectively as the Batoka Gorge system. The First Gorge, directly beneath the cataract, measures 80 to 108 meters in depth and approximately 120 meters in width at its narrowest point, with near-vertical walls exposing layered basalt. Subsequent gorges, such as the Second Gorge containing the Boiling Pot—a turbulent pool formed by swirling waters—and Rainbow Falls, maintain similar steep profiles, with walls generally 120 meters high and river levels fluctuating up to 20 meters seasonally.

These gorges originated from the river's erosive exploitation of pre-existing structural weaknesses in the underlying basalt plateau. The Batoka basalts, deposited as thick flows during Jurassic volcanism approximately 180 million years ago, feature orthogonal joint sets aligned east-west and north-south, resulting from tectonic stresses during the breakup of Gondwana around 110 million years ago. Fissures along these joints were infilled with softer sedimentary materials, including sandstones and clays, which erode more readily than the surrounding hard tholeiitic basalt.

The erosional process involves the Zambezi initially following east-west joints, undercutting the basalt cap and causing upstream retreat, then incising north-south channels to redirect flow, producing the characteristic zigzag morphology. Basalt thickness reaches at least 300 meters in the Falls vicinity, with cross-sections revealing dark blue-black layers interspersed by reddish weathering seams; fractured zones often act as aquifers, accelerating local weathering through groundwater circulation. Current retreat rates average 7 centimeters per year, positioning the present falls as the eighth successive cataract in this ongoing cycle, dated to about 100,000 years ago.

## Geological Origins

### Tectonic Formation

The tectonic origins of Victoria Falls trace to the Early Jurassic period, approximately 180 million years ago, when the Batoka Basalts were extruded as part of the Karoo-Ferrar Large Igneous Province during the initial rifting of the Gondwana supercontinent. This province encompassed massive flood basalt volcanism, with an estimated 2.5 million cubic kilometers of lava erupted across southern Gondwana, linked to extensional tectonics and mantle plume activity that facilitated crustal fissuring and magma ascent. At the falls site, these basalts form a resistant caprock layer at least 300 meters thick, overlying softer sedimentary units, creating the structural trap for subsequent fluvial incision.

Tectonic stresses during and post-extrusion induced orthogonal joint sets in the cooling basalt, oriented primarily east-west and north-south, which delineate lines of mechanical weakness later exploited by erosion. The east-west trending joint system aligns with the Zambezi River's course across the plateau, positioning the falls' precipice along this fracture zone where the river encounters a vertical drop. North-south joints facilitated upstream gorge development, resulting in the characteristic zigzag pattern of the Batoka Gorges downstream, with specific segments like the Second and Fifth Gorges controlled by fault displacements of 45-50 meters.

Subsequent Cenozoic tectonic uplift in southern Africa, potentially tied to the African Superswell and superplume dynamics, elevated the regional plateau and reorganized drainage basins, directing the Zambezi to incise along these pre-existing tectonic structures around 15-20 million years ago. This uplift reversed earlier river patterns, capturing headwaters and establishing the nickpoint that defines the falls, though the primary lithological and structural framework remains rooted in Jurassic tectonics. Fault reactivation along joint planes continues to influence gorge morphology, with downthrows to the north or south modulating erosion rates estimated at 42-80 mm per year.

### Erosional Development and Age

The erosional development of Victoria Falls involves the headward retreat of the Zambezi River across the Batoka basalt plateau, exploiting orthogonal joint sets oriented WNW-ESE and NE-SW within the basalt layers. These joints, often filled with softer sedimentary infills or weathered material, allow preferential erosion, with the river initially cutting east-west to form primary gorges and secondary north-south channels that link them in a zigzag pattern. The process begins with the waterfall's plunge over the resistant basalt caprock, which undercuts underlying softer zones, leading to periodic collapse of the lip and upstream migration; this has produced eight downstream gorges, each marking a successive position of the falls, with the First Gorge immediately below the current drop and older gorges extending into the Batoka system. Ongoing erosion continues to sculpt the hard basalts, as evidenced by the dynamic nickpoint at the present falls edge.

The Batoka basalt underlying the falls dates to the Karoo period, approximately 180 million years ago, formed through successive lava flows up to 300 meters thick at the site and exceeding 1,000 meters regionally. However, the active erosional phase shaping the modern falls and gorges postdates major tectonic uplift of the southern African Plateau and the Zambezi's drainage reorganization, initiating headward incision of the Batoka Gorge—a 90-kilometer feature—over an estimated 1.4 to 2.54 million years at average retreat rates of 42 to 80 mm per year. Alternative calculations, derived from archaeological dating of river-deposited artifacts in Kalahari sands (ranging from Early Stone Age at ~2.5 million to 500,000 years ago to Late Stone Age at ~20,000–30,000 years ago), indicate higher rates of up to 0.9 meters per year for the lower gorges over 540,000–790,000 years, with the current falls retreating more slowly at 0.29 meters per year; these variations reflect episodic acceleration tied to climatic fluctuations and discharge changes. Overall, the falls represent a transient stage in a broader two-million-year cycle of river incision and gorge evolution.

## Naming and Cultural Context

### European Naming and Exploration

The Scottish missionary and explorer David Livingstone reached Victoria Falls on 16 November 1855 during his eastward journey along the Zambezi River, becoming the first European to document the site. Accompanied by approximately 200 Makololo people under Chief Sekeletu, Livingstone portaged from canoes to an island amid the river—later named Livingstone Island—where he viewed the 1.7-kilometer-wide chasm and rising mist. No prior European expeditions had accessed the falls, as earlier Portuguese ventures in the Zambezi basin, such as Francisco de Lacerda's 1798 trek to the Kazembe kingdom, remained confined to northern tributaries without descending to the main cataract.

Livingstone named the falls *Victoria Falls* in tribute to Queen Victoria, diverging from his usual practice of retaining indigenous toponyms on maps. In his journal entry, he described the scene as "a scene of wonderful beauty" exceeding the combined width of the Nile's cataracts, with ceaseless thunder and a columnar cloud of spray visible for miles. This account, published in *Missionary Travels and Researches in South Africa* (1857), introduced the falls to European audiences, emphasizing their scale—approximately 108 meters high and fed by the Zambezi's seasonal flood peaking at 9,000 cubic meters per second—and potential for navigation or settlement.

Subsequent European exploration built on Livingstone's route. In 1860, he returned with physician John Kirk to conduct geodetic surveys, measuring the gorge's depth and confirming the falls' position at 17°55′S 25°50′E via astronomical observations. These efforts, amid Livingstone's advocacy for anti-slavery commerce, drew British imperial attention, paving the way for hunter-explorer Frederick Selous's visits in the 1870s and early colonial surveys by the British South Africa Company in the 1890s. By 1905, the Victoria Falls Bridge, engineered by George Hobson of Cleveland Bridge \u0026 Engineering Company, spanned the gorge 130 meters above the river, facilitating rail access from Bulawayo and Livingstone townships.

### Indigenous Designations and Traditional Uses

The primary indigenous designation for Victoria Falls among the Tokaleya (also known as Toka-Leya) and Lozi peoples is *Mosi-oa-Tunya*, which translates to "the smoke that thunders," descriptive of the perpetual mist resembling smoke and the deafening roar produced by the cascading water. This name emerged in local Bantu languages, with usage documented among communities predating European contact, including the Kololo who influenced the region in the early 19th century. The Tonga (Batonga) people, indigenous to the Zambezi Valley areas adjacent to the falls, alternatively call it *Shungu Namutitima*, meaning "water that thunders" or "boiling water," emphasizing the violent hydrological force. These designations reflect empirical observations of the falls' acoustic and visual phenomena, rooted in the direct experiences of riparian communities rather than external impositions.

For the Batonga and neighboring Leya peoples, Victoria Falls held profound spiritual significance as a sacred site inhabited by ancestral spirits and supernatural entities, such as the river god Nyami Nyami in local lore, who governed the Zambezi's waters. Traditional practices centered on rituals and ceremonies to appease these spirits, seeking protection from floods, bountiful rains, or safe passage along the river, often involving offerings at designated points near the gorge rather than direct access to the hazardous drop. The falls' mist and thunder were interpreted as manifestations of divine power, prohibiting casual approach and reserving the area for initiated elders or rainmaking rites, as evidenced in oral histories preserved by Valley Tonga groups displaced downstream in the 20th century. Practical uses were limited by the site's inaccessibility and peril; while the broader Zambezi supported fishing and canoe-based trade among Batonga communities, the falls themselves were avoided for exploitation, prioritizing reverence over utilitarian extraction to maintain spiritual equilibrium.

These traditions underscore a causal understanding among indigenous groups of the falls' environmental dominance—its seasonal flood peaks from February to May amplifying ritual timing—without evidence of large-scale resource harvesting that could alter hydrological dynamics. Post-colonial tourism has commodified some practices, such as village demonstrations by Leya descendants under Chief Mukuni, but core designations and taboos persist in community governance.

## Historical Timeline

### Pre-Colonial Human Interactions

Archaeological excavations in the Victoria Falls region have uncovered stone tools from the Early Stone Age, including Oldowan choppers and Acheulean hand axes, dating back over 1.8 million years, indicating early hominid occupation focused on resource exploitation in the Zambezi River valley. Middle Stone Age artifacts, such as spear points from approximately 250,000 years ago, and Late Stone Age hafted blades around 45,000 years ago, suggest more advanced hunting and processing activities near the gorges, with over 39 sites documented in the Mosi-oa-Tunya area on the Zambian side. These findings point to sustained human presence tied to the river's hydrology for water, food, and migration routes, though direct interaction with the falls' current form remains speculative due to geological changes.

Khoisan hunter-gatherers, employing iron tools, inhabited the area prior to the Bantu expansions of the first millennium AD, engaging in foraging and small-scale mobility around the Zambezi, but were gradually displaced by incoming groups. Bantu-speaking peoples, arriving around the early AD period, introduced Iron Age technologies including pastoral agriculture, iron smelting, pottery, and settled villages, with evidence of copper trade and hoe-based farming adapting to the floodplains adjacent to the falls. By the 12th century, the Early Tonga Tradition, linked to the Leya (Toka-Leya) peoples, established communities in the immediate vicinity, utilizing the river for fishing and the surrounding basalt for resource extraction while developing localized ironworking.

The Toka-Leya and Batoka (southern Tonga) peoples regarded the falls as a sacred site, designating it Mosi-oa-Tunya ("the smoke that thunders") and associating it with spiritual entities requiring appeasement through rituals, including offerings thrown into the waters to invoke rain and fertility. Leya traditions, dating to around 1600 AD, named it Shungu na Mutitima ("roaring lion"), reflecting its thundering auditory presence, and incorporated it into ceremonies like the Lwiindi rain-making ritual, where chiefs and initiates performed acts near the spray to summon seasonal floods and ensure agricultural cycles. Archaeological traces of clay human and animal effigies buried in pits near baobab trees near the falls indicate ritual depositions tied to ancestral veneration and environmental propitiation, underscoring the site's role as a locus for supernatural access in pre-colonial cosmology.

### Colonial Era Advancements

The European sighting of Victoria Falls by Scottish explorer and missionary David Livingstone on November 16, 1855, marked the onset of colonial interest, as he documented the cataract's dimensions—spanning approximately 1,700 meters wide and dropping 108 meters—and named it in honor of Queen Victoria, contrasting it with indigenous designations like *Mosi-oa-Tunya*.  Livingstone's accounts, published in *Missionary Travels and Researches in South Africa* (1857), fueled British imperial ambitions, including Cecil Rhodes' vision for a Cape-to-Cairo railway to consolidate control over Central African territories administered by the British South Africa Company from the 1890s onward. 

A pivotal infrastructural advancement materialized with the construction of the Victoria Falls Bridge, initiated in 1904 to span the Zambezi River gorge 94 meters above the riverbed, directly upstream from the falls. Prefabricated in Darlington, England, by Cleveland Bridge \u0026 Engineering Company and shipped via the Portuguese port of Beira, the 198-meter-long steel arch truss structure—designed by engineer George Andrew Hobson—was assembled on-site in just 14 months despite logistical challenges in the remote bushveld.  Officially opened on September 12, 1905, by Sir William Mackinnon, the bridge accommodated a single railway track, road, and pedestrian traffic, serving as the sole border crossing between Northern and Southern Rhodesia and enabling the northward extension of the Cape-to-Cairo railway line, which reached the falls that year.  This engineering feat, requiring innovative erection techniques like creeper cranes to position 156-ton girders, facilitated mineral exports, settler migration, and administrative integration, with the bridge later widened in 1929 to handle increased dual-gauge rail traffic. 

Concomitant with rail connectivity, colonial tourism infrastructure emerged around 1900, transforming the falls into a premier destination within British Southern Africa. The Victoria Falls Hotel, constructed in 1904 adjacent to the bridge, catered to affluent European travelers arriving by train, offering opulent accommodations that capitalized on the site's scenic allure and proximity to big-game hunting grounds. Livingstone, established as Northern Rhodesia's capital in 1905, functioned as a gateway town with customs posts and early visitor facilities, drawing hunters, missionaries, and sightseers; by the 1910s, guided tours and footpaths along the gorge rim were formalized, boosting economic activity through lodging, provisioning, and transport services under colonial administration. These developments, while advancing accessibility and revenue—evidenced by rising visitor logs tied to railway timetables—prioritized European access over local populations, embedding the falls within imperial trade networks until Rhodesian independence movements in the mid-20th century.

### Post-Independence Developments

In Zambia, the National Parks and Wildlife Act of 1968 facilitated the formal protection of the falls area, culminating in the establishment of Mosi-oa-Tunya National Park in 1972 via Statutory Instrument 44, covering 66 km² on the Zambian side including rainforest and riverine zones. This park, managed by the Zambian Wildlife Authority, emphasized wildlife conservation amid growing post-independence tourism pressures.

Zimbabwe's independence on April 18, 1980, marked a turning point, with the reopening of upstream areas and a sharp rebound in tourism; international arrivals to the country surged from 238,000 in 1980 to 314,000 in 1981, driven by renewed access to Victoria Falls. Visitor numbers continued climbing, reaching 412,212 in 1988 and 435,875 in 1989, reflecting infrastructure expansions like fenced rainforest access (450 ha in 1986) and a US$1 entry fee for foreigners. The Zambezi National Park, spanning 56,010 ha along the river upstream, was established in 1979 shortly before independence, while Victoria Falls National Park (2,340 ha, divided into core areas) was formalized in 1983, enhancing habitat protection for species like elephants and buffaloes.

Jointly, the falls were inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1989 under the name Mosi-oa-Tunya / Victoria Falls, recognizing their geological and aesthetic significance across 6,460 ha shared between the two nations' parks. This status spurred coordinated conservation but also highlighted emerging tensions over development, as tourism infrastructure proliferated on both sides during the 1980s boom, including hotels like Ilala Lodge (1991) and adventure facilities. Subsequent decades saw cyclical growth, with visitor numbers doubling to around 2 million by 2000 amid economic volatility in Zimbabwe, though the region retained its status as a key African draw through airport upgrades, such as the $150 million Victoria Falls International Airport expansion starting in 2013.

### Contemporary Infrastructure and Events

The Victoria Falls International Airport in Zimbabwe has seen ongoing expansions to accommodate rising tourist traffic, with a $150 million upgrade project launched in 2013 to increase passenger handling capacity from 350,000 to over 2 million annually through new terminals, runways, and facilities. In July 2024, the airport completed electrification of its perimeter fence to enhance security. Zimbabwe's 2025 infrastructure program includes further rehabilitation of key airports like Victoria Falls to modernize aviation and support tourism growth. On the Zambian side, Harry Mwaanga Nkombala International Airport in Livingstone serves as a primary gateway, with recent investments in runway extensions and terminal improvements tied to regional tourism recovery.

Road infrastructure linking Victoria Falls to major cities is undergoing rehabilitation, notably the Bulawayo-Victoria Falls highway, where upgrades began in 2025 to improve connectivity, reduce travel times, and bolster logistics for tourism and trade. The historic Victoria Falls Bridge, spanning the Zambezi since 1905, continues to facilitate rail and vehicular traffic but has not seen major structural overhauls in recent decades, though maintenance addresses corrosion from the humid environment. Energy infrastructure features the proposed Batoka Gorge Hydroelectric Power Station downstream from the falls, a 2,400-megawatt project revived in 2025 by Zambia and Zimbabwe seeking investors for construction expected to commence within 12-18 months, aiming to address regional power shortages without directly impounding the falls themselves.

Tourism-related developments include the $43 million Eagle Heights precinct in Zimbabwe, advancing in 2025 with integrated hospitality, retail, medical, and residential components to diversify the local economy beyond waterfall viewing. Plans for a 5,000-seat conference center and four-star hotel, alongside an international cricket stadium foundation laid by President Mnangagwa, reflect ambitions to position Victoria Falls as a multi-purpose destination, though these face scrutiny for potential encroachment into ecologically sensitive buffer zones designated under UNESCO guidelines. Conservation advocates highlight risks to the site's World Heritage status from such expansions, including habitat fragmentation and increased urban runoff.

Recent events underscore the falls' vulnerability to climatic variability, with March 2025 floods channeling 500-770 million liters of water per minute over the cataract due to heavy upstream rains, temporarily closing viewing trails and disrupting activities like bungee jumping. This followed drier periods in prior years, including low flows in 2024 that reduced mist visibility and tourism appeal, attributed to compressed rainy seasons amid broader regional warming trends. In June 2025, Victoria Falls earned UNESCO Wetland City designation for its biodiversity, yet simultaneous reports noted infrastructure creep into no-development zones, prompting debates over balancing economic gains with preservation. Post-COVID tourism rebounded with high-water peaks drawing visitors in early 2025, though droughts remain a recurring threat to flow consistency and visitor numbers.

## Ecological Profile

### Flora and Vegetation

The vegetation around Victoria Falls is characterized by a distinctive rainforest habitat within the immediate vicinity of the falls, sustained by the perpetual mist and spray from the cascading water, which generates a unique microclimate of high humidity and near-constant moisture. This spray zone supports a specialized flora adapted to wet conditions, including moisture-loving herbaceous plants, ferns, mosses, orchids, and epiphytes that thrive on tree trunks and rocks. The rainforest encompasses nearly 150 species of trees and tall shrubs, over 50 shrub species, and approximately 150 herbaceous and field species, alongside grasses, sedges, and ferns, fostering a dense canopy of figs, palms, hanging vines, thick shrubs, and creepers.

Dominant tree species in the rainforest include two varieties of waterboom (*Syzygium guineense*), which form about 80% of the canopy and exhibit adaptations such as thick, waxy leaves to retain moisture amid the saturated environment. Other notable plants include the hairy-leaved Cape fig (*Ficus sur*), pod mahogany, ebony, ivory palm, wild date palm, and batoko plum, many of which are rare or uncommon outside this spray-influenced zone, highlighting the habitat's role in supporting localized biodiversity. Epiphytic orchids and climbing plants further exploit the humid conditions, while the ground layer features colorful flowering shrubs and a profusion of over 170 floral species, contributing to the area's estimated total of around 400 vascular plant species across trees, shrubs, grasses, sedges, and ferns.

Beyond the rainforest, the surrounding landscape transitions to miombo woodland, a dry deciduous savanna dominated by leguminous trees such as *Brachystegia* species (e.g., msasa) and *Julbernardia* species, which shed leaves seasonally to conserve water in the region's variable climate. This woodland, interspersed with mopane forest (*Colophospermum mopane*), teak stands, and narrow riverine fringes along the Zambezi, hosts over 8,500 plant species regionally, with characteristic miombo elements like *Afzelia quanzensis* and *Acacia nigrescens* providing structural diversity and supporting ecological processes such as nutrient cycling through leaf litter decomposition. The contrast between the lush, mist-dependent rainforest and the fire-adapted, drought-tolerant miombo underscores the falls' influence on local vegetation gradients, where spray attenuates with distance, favoring progressively xerophytic flora.

### Terrestrial Wildlife

The terrestrial wildlife of the Victoria Falls region thrives in the mosaic of rainforest, riverine thickets, and mopane woodlands spanning Victoria Falls National Park in Zimbabwe and Mosi-oa-Tunya National Park in Zambia. These habitats support a variety of large mammals, though populations are influenced by proximity to larger reserves like Hwange National Park and ongoing conservation challenges. Elephants (*Loxodonta africana*) frequently migrate through the area, with herds often entering urban fringes of Victoria Falls town due to resource availability, reflecting broader population pressures from nearby Hwange's estimated 40,000-42,000 individuals as of 2022.

White rhinoceros (*Ceratotherium simum*) represent a conservation success in Mosi-oa-Tunya National Park, where a small, closely monitored population of nine individuals—comprising two males and seven females—persists as of December 2024, making it one of Zambia's last viable groups amid national poaching threats. Other herbivores include giraffes (*Giraffa camelopardalis*), plains zebras (*Equus quagga*), wildebeest (*Connochaetes taurinus*), Cape buffaloes (*Syncerus caffer*), and antelopes such as impala (*Aepyceros melampus*), waterbuck (*Kobus ellipsiprymnus*), and bushbuck (*Tragelaphus scriptus*), which graze the park's grasslands and woodlands.

Carnivores are less abundant in the immediate falls vicinity but include African lions (*Panthera leo*) and leopards (*Panthera pardus*) from surrounding savannas, alongside smaller predators like spotted hyenas (*Crocuta crocuta*). Primates such as chacma baboons (*Papio ursinus*) and vervet monkeys (*Chlorocebus pygerythrus*), along with warthogs (*Phacochoerus africanus*) and mongooses, inhabit the denser vegetation. Conservation efforts, including anti-poaching patrols and rhino tracking, sustain these species against habitat fragmentation and human-wildlife conflict, with organizations like the Victoria Falls Wildlife Trust emphasizing research for long-term viability.

### Aquatic Species and Fisheries

The Zambezi River upstream of Victoria Falls harbors approximately 134 fish species, of which 24 are endemic, representing about 17% of the total, while downstream sections support around 70 species with only about 30 shared across the divide due to the falls' role as a migration barrier. This faunal separation, reinforced by the 108-meter drop and turbulent waters, limits gene flow and promotes distinct evolutionary lineages, as evidenced by species like the Upper Zambezi yellowfish (*Labeobarbus marequensis*) confined above the falls.

Prominent species in the upper Zambezi include the aggressive tigerfish (*Hydrocynus vittatus*), renowned for its predatory behavior and striped pattern, alongside the vundu catfish (*Heterobranchus longifilis*), Africa's largest freshwater catfish reaching up to 1.5 meters, bream (*Sarotherodon* spp.), nembwe (*Serranochromis* spp.), barbel, and electric catfish (*Malapterurus* spp.). Below the falls, in the Batoka Gorge and middle Zambezi, diversity decreases, but tigerfish persist alongside bream and introduced or translocated species like certain mormyrids, though upstream endemics such as *Marcusenius altisambesi* occasionally appear downstream, suggesting rare overtopping events. Other aquatic life includes Nile crocodiles (*Crocodylus niloticus*) and hippopotamuses (*Hippopotamus amphibius*), which influence fish distributions through predation, though fisheries focus primarily on ichthyofauna.

Fisheries in the vicinity emphasize recreational angling over commercial exploitation, with tigerfish as the premier target due to its fighting prowess, attracting guided half- or full-day safaris from bases like Victoria Falls town, often yielding catches year-round in the warm, flowing waters above the cataract. Operations typically employ catch-and-release practices to sustain stocks, equipped with specialized tackle for species like bream and vundu, amid hazards from hippos and crocodiles; commercial netting is minimal near the falls owing to rapids and conservation zones within Victoria Falls National Park. Baseline surveys highlight the river's role as critical habitat for socioeconomically valuable fish, underscoring regulated sport fishing's alignment with biodiversity preservation.

## Environmental Dynamics

### Climate Influences on Flow Variability

The flow of the Zambezi River at Victoria Falls exhibits pronounced seasonal variability driven by the tropical savanna climate of its upper catchment, where rainfall is concentrated in the wet season from November to March, leading to peak discharges between February and May, often exceeding 2,000 m³/s, followed by a sharp decline to minima around 400 m³/s or less by November. This cycle reflects the basin's dependence on convective rainfall from the Intertropical Convergence Zone, with evapotranspiration dominating during the dry season (April to October), reducing baseflow contributions.

Interannual variability is substantial, with annual mean discharges at Victoria Falls ranging from as low as 390 m³/s in the drought year of 1995/96 to over 2,300 m³/s in wet years, primarily due to fluctuations in upstream precipitation across the 1.3 million km² catchment spanning Angola, Zambia, and neighboring regions. These variations stem from causal linkages between regional moisture convergence and large-scale atmospheric teleconnections, including the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), where El Niño phases correlate with suppressed rainfall and reduced runoff, as evidenced by the 2015/16 event that halved flows in southern Africa through anomalous anticyclonic circulation.

Long-term trends indicate a potential downward shift in mean flows, with analyses showing a decline from approximately 1,347 m³/s pre-1980 to 1,031 m³/s afterward at Victoria Falls, attributable to observed increases in temperature and evapotranspiration amid variable rainfall patterns. Climate models project exacerbated variability under warming scenarios, with reduced wet-season rainfall and heightened drought risks in the Zambezi Basin, though empirical records highlight natural oscillations as the dominant short-term driver over anthropogenic signals to date.

### Conservation Measures and Protected Status

The Mosi-oa-Tunya/Victoria Falls area was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1989, recognizing its exceptional geological, geomorphological, and ecological features, with the site encompassing approximately 6,760 hectares across Zambia and Zimbabwe. This status imposes international obligations for conservation, including periodic reporting on the state of conservation and implementation of corrective measures to maintain outstanding universal value.

In Zimbabwe, the southern portion falls within Victoria Falls National Park, covering 2,340 hectares and managed under the Parks and Wildlife Management Authority Act, which prohibits activities threatening biodiversity such as unregulated development or poaching. In Zambia, the northern section is protected as part of Mosi-oa-Tunya National Park, governed by the Zambia Wildlife Act and National Heritage Conservation Act, establishing buffer zones and restricting extractive uses to preserve habitats for species like white rhinoceros and elephants.

Conservation measures include ongoing eradication of invasive alien species, such as *Lantana camara*, to protect native flora, alongside regular updates to biodiversity databases for monitoring endemic and migratory species. Anti-poaching patrols and snare removal initiatives, often involving community rangers, target threats to megafauna, with specific efforts focused on reintroducing and safeguarding black and white rhinoceros populations in Mosi-oa-Tunya through fenced sanctuaries free of large predators. Human-wildlife conflict mitigation programs address crop raiding by hippopotamus and elephants via community education and compensation schemes, promoting coexistence while enforcing park boundaries.

Transboundary cooperation between Zambia and Zimbabwe facilitates joint management plans, including shared monitoring of hydrological impacts on habitats and participation in regional forums like the Africa Protected Areas Directors conference held in Victoria Falls in 2024 to strengthen enforcement and funding for protected area sustainability.

### Development Conflicts and Heritage Risks

The proposed Batoka Gorge Hydroelectric Scheme, a 2,400 MW dam located approximately 54 km downstream on the Zambezi River, exemplifies tensions between energy development and environmental preservation at Victoria Falls. Jointly pursued by Zambia and Zimbabwe since the 1990s to address chronic power shortages, the project involves a 181-meter-high structure whose reservoir would extend 10.75 km into the World Heritage property, raising water levels by up to 43 meters and flooding portions of the Batoka Gorge. While state parties assert minimal direct effects on the falls' flow and UNESCO cleared the project in 2023 following environmental and social impact assessments (ESIA) and site inspections, critics including environmental organizations contend it would inundate unique gorge habitats, displace communities, and diminish the site's scenic and ecological integrity, potentially reducing tourism appeal. UNESCO's 1993 decision highlighted serious downstream impacts, transforming turbulent gorges into a reservoir, though not altering the falls themselves.

Tourism infrastructure expansion presents another conflict, driven by the site's economic importance—generating significant revenue for both nations amid growing visitor numbers—but risking ecological degradation in sensitive zones. On the Zimbabwean side, within Victoria Falls National Park, proposals for lodges, hotels, and recreational facilities have proliferated in the "no new development" or "red zone" areas designated as highly ecologically sensitive, including at least seven hotels with over 400 beds constructed since 2007. Similarly, the Mosi-oa-Tunya Livingstone Resort in Zambia proceeded despite UNESCO requests for construction halts, contributing to cumulative pressures from urban sprawl in adjacent Livingstone (population 178,361 in 2022) and Victoria Falls towns. These developments, alongside activities like helicopter flights (serving 60,000 tourists in 2019) and motorboat operations, introduce noise pollution, habitat fragmentation, and visual intrusions that compromise the site's wilderness character.

Such developments heighten risks to the site's UNESCO World Heritage status, inscribed in 1989 for its outstanding universal value (OUV) encompassing geological, ecological, and aesthetic features of the falls and gorges. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) assesses overall threats as high, citing inadequate planning and boundary inconsistencies that allow encroachments in buffer zones, with 16 additional infrastructure projects proposed as of 2023. UNESCO's 2023 state of conservation report warns of escalating cumulative impacts threatening OUV, urging revisions to the Joint Integrated Management Plan, completion of a strategic environmental assessment, and boundary modifications to enforce protections. Non-compliance could lead to reactive monitoring or delisting, as seen in precedents elsewhere, though state parties have committed to mitigation without fully implementing past recommendations. Cross-border coordination remains challenged by differing national priorities, with Zambia and Zimbabwe's energy demands (exacerbated by droughts reducing hydropower output) clashing against global heritage obligations.

## Socioeconomic Dimensions

### Tourism Growth and Visitor Statistics

Tourism to Victoria Falls has shown robust recovery and growth following the sharp decline induced by the COVID-19 pandemic, with annual visitor numbers to the site's Rainforest areas—serving as a primary proxy for direct Falls access—rising from pandemic lows toward pre-2020 peaks. On the Zimbabwean (south-bank) side, managed by the Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority (ZimParks), Rainforest entries totaled 302,626 in 2023, including 211,057 international visitors, reflecting a rebound from earlier restrictions but still below the 397,436 total (310,732 international) recorded in 2019. The Zambian (north-bank) side saw 227,510 total visitors in 2023, comprising 51,125 international and a dominant 176,385 domestic contingent, boosted by regional accessibility.

In 2024, preliminary indicators pointed to accelerated growth, with Zimbabwe's national tourism arrivals surging 27% in the first half-year to 751,483 compared to 2023's equivalent period, much of which funneled to Victoria Falls via expanded airport capacity and direct international flights. Specific Rainforest data for the full year remained pending official ZimParks tallies, but quarterly trends suggested continued upward momentum, driven by overseas markets recovering to 70% of 2019 levels nationally. On the Zambian side, north-bank visits reached 80,000 from January to September 2024, marking a 40% increase over the same period in 2023, amid broader national international arrivals climbing to over 2.1 million for the year.

Early 2025 data underscored sustained international demand, with the Zimbabwean Rainforest recording 61,139 visitors in the first quarter—a 2.4% rise from 59,718 in Q1 2024—wherein international arrivals jumped to 47,633 from 44,110, offsetting a minor domestic dip from 15,608 to 13,506. This growth aligns with facilitations like the Kavango-Zambezi (KAZA) UniVisa and infrastructure upgrades, though statistics from official bodies such as ZimParks and Zambia's Ministry of Tourism warrant scrutiny for potential underreporting of informal entries or revisions, as seen in prior years where south-bank figures were adjusted downward post-initial release. Historically, combined annual visitors hovered around 500,000–600,000 pre-pandemic, predominantly on the Zimbabwean side due to established infrastructure, with recent trends indicating a potential return to or exceedance of one million total if national projections materialize.

### Economic Contributions and Local Benefits

Tourism represents the primary economic contribution of Victoria Falls, generating substantial revenue through visitor expenditures on accommodations, guided activities, transportation, and local crafts in the bordering towns of Livingstone, Zambia, and Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe. Estimates indicate total annual tourism expenditure at the site reaches approximately $426 million, encompassing direct spending by international and domestic visitors on hospitality, food services, and adventure tourism such as bungee jumping and helicopter tours. This inflow supports ancillary industries like retail and artisanal markets, where local vendors sell wood carvings and textiles sourced from regional communities.

In Zimbabwe, Victoria Falls accounts for about 30% of national tourism revenue, which stood at US$1.16 billion in 2023, underscoring the site's outsized role in a sector contributing 5.7% to the country's GDP that year.  Visitor fees alone generate around $6.7 million annually for park management and conservation efforts, with spillover effects bolstering infrastructure like airport expansions that facilitate increased arrivals, such as the 61,139 tourists recorded in the first quarter of 2025.  On the Zambian side, Livingstone's economy relies heavily on Falls-related tourism, with revenue from entry fees and activities funding municipal services and drawing investments in lodges that prioritize local hiring.

Local benefits manifest through employment generation, particularly in low-skilled sectors accessible to residents with limited formal education. In the Victoria Falls area of Zimbabwe, tourism employs about 25% of the local workforce but accounts for 49% of the total wage bill, indicating higher average earnings compared to other local industries like subsistence agriculture or informal trading. Recent developments, such as the 2025 opening of Waterfalls Lodge, have created over 70 direct jobs in housekeeping, guiding, and maintenance, with additional indirect positions in supply chains for food and transport. Community-level studies highlight tourism's role in poverty reduction by providing seasonal income opportunities, though benefits are unevenly distributed due to foreign ownership of major operators, which can lead to revenue leakage; nonetheless, direct local participation in guiding and craft sales ensures some wealth retention. Infrastructure projects tied to tourism, including the Bulawayo-Victoria Falls highway upgrade, are projected to yield over 2,000 temporary construction jobs while enhancing access for future visitors.

### Infrastructure and Cross-Border Dynamics

The Victoria Falls Bridge, a steel-lattice arch structure spanning 198 meters and rising 128 meters above the Zambezi River, serves as the primary cross-border link between Zambia and Zimbabwe, accommodating road, rail, and pedestrian traffic. Constructed between 1904 and 1905 by the Cleveland Bridge \u0026 Engineering Company in England and assembled on-site, it was officially opened on September 12, 1905, functioning as the sole rail connection between the two nations and facilitating trade and tourism flows. 

Access to the falls is supported by international airports on both sides: Victoria Falls International Airport in Zimbabwe, which handles direct flights from regional hubs and supports tourist influx, and Harry Mwaanga Nkumbula International Airport near Livingstone in Zambia, enabling seamless multi-country itineraries including transfers to Botswana. Tarmac roads provide reliable connectivity, with the border crossing at the bridge featuring immigration posts for efficient pedestrian and vehicle processing, though delays can occur due to volume.

Cross-border dynamics are shaped by cooperative frameworks despite occasional political strains, with Zambia and Zimbabwe reaffirming commitments to joint tourism promotion during their 3rd Joint Tourism Technical Committee meeting on October 11, 2025, focusing on shared attractions like the falls. The Mosi-oa-Tunya/Victoria Falls site, designated a transboundary UNESCO World Heritage property in 1989, benefits from public-private partnerships regulating infrastructure to balance development and preservation, including controls on proximity to the falls to mitigate erosion risks from unchecked expansion. Ongoing challenges include uneven infrastructure maturity—Zimbabwe's side offers more developed pathways—yet bilateral efforts sustain visitor access across the border for comprehensive experiences.

## Quantitative Data

### Hydrological and Meteorological Records

The hydrological station at Victoria Falls, located at the base of the unregulated upper Zambezi River segment, has measured river discharge continuously since 1907. The long-term mean annual flow rate stands at 1,100 cubic meters per second (m³/s), reflecting the cumulative contribution from the upper Zambezi basin upstream of the falls. Seasonal variability is pronounced, with peak discharges typically occurring between March and May following heavy upstream rainfall in the wet season, often exceeding 3,000 m³/s in average high-water years, while low-water periods from October to December commonly drop below 500 m³/s. The record maximum flow was 10,000 m³/s, recorded in March 1958 during an exceptional flood event. Conversely, the lowest annual mean flow occurred in the 1995/96 drought season at 390 m³/s, highlighting the basin's susceptibility to prolonged dry periods. Analysis of long-term data indicates a declining trend in annual mean discharge, with a shift from approximately 1,347 m³/s before 1980 to 1,031 m³/s afterward, potentially linked to changes in precipitation patterns and land use in the catchment.

Meteorological records for the Victoria Falls area, drawn from regional stations in Zimbabwe and Zambia, document a hot subtropical climate with distinct wet and dry seasons. Annual precipitation averages 690–727 mm, with over 70% concentrated in the summer wet season from November to March, driven by convective thunderstorms and the Intertropical Convergence Zone.  Mean annual temperature is approximately 23°C, with diurnal and seasonal ranges featuring hot days (up to 34°C in October–November) and cooler nights (down to 8°C in winter months). Recent trends show compressed rainy periods and reduced early-season (October–November) rainfall, contributing to lower river inflows during low-water phases, as evidenced by flows dipping below historical minima in multiple recent dry years. These patterns underscore the direct causal link between regional meteorology and hydrological output, with upstream rainfall deficits amplifying flow variability at the falls.

### Visitation and Economic Metrics

Visitor numbers to Victoria Falls, tracked primarily through rainforest entry fees on both the Zimbabwean and Zambian sides, have demonstrated post-pandemic recovery with annual totals exceeding 500,000 combined in recent years. On the Zimbabwean side, 302,626 visitors were recorded for the south-bank rainforest in 2024, including 211,057 international arrivals. The Zambian side reported 227,510 visitors to the falls in 2023, comprising 51,125 international visitors alongside substantial domestic access. Daily averages on the Zimbabwean side rose to 1,300 visitors in late 2024, reflecting a 30% increase over 2023 figures despite El Niño-induced low water levels. Early 2025 data from Zimbabwe indicated 61,139 visitors in the first quarter alone, signaling continued momentum.

Economically, Victoria Falls tourism has been a cornerstone for both Zambia and Zimbabwe, generating substantial revenue through entry fees, accommodations, and adventure activities. In 2018, falls-related tourism accounted for approximately 30% of Zimbabwe's total US$1.386 billion in tourism earnings, equating to roughly US$415 million. National tourism receipts in Zimbabwe climbed 22% in 2024 amid broader arrivals growth, with Victoria Falls driving much of the sector's expansion. The industry supports thousands of direct and indirect jobs in hospitality, guiding, and transport, while contributing to foreign exchange reserves; however, revenue volatility tied to seasonal flows and global events underscores dependency risks. In Zambia, tourism overall represented 5.8% of GDP in 2021, with Victoria Falls as a primary draw enhancing local multipliers through supply chains.

| Year | Zimbabwe Side Visitors | Zambian Side Visitors | Notes |
|------|-------------------------|------------------------|-------|
| 2023 | ~250,000 (est. from trends) | 227,510 | Recovery phase; daily avg. 1,000 on Zim side |
| 2024 | 302,626 | N/A | 30% surge; intl. focus |

Zimbabwe's government has prioritized falls-centric development, including the Masuwe Special Economic Zone aimed at US$5 billion in tourism investment, though such initiatives face scrutiny over environmental trade-offs. Overall, the site's economic footprint bolsters GDP contributions—estimated at 5.7% nationally for Zimbabwe in recent assessments—with Victoria Falls amplifying regional benefits via cross-border visitor flows.
