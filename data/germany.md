## Historical Background
Germany's history is complex and spans thousands of years, marked by periods of unity, division, and transformation.

- **Ancient and Medieval Periods**: The region now known as Germany was inhabited by Germanic tribes during the Roman Empire's expansion. The Holy Roman Empire, established in 962 under Otto I, became a loose confederation of states that dominated Central Europe for nearly a millennium, though it was often fragmented [Encyclopedia Britannica - Holy Roman Empire](https://www.britannica.com/place/Holy-Roman-Empire).
- **Unification in 1871**: Modern Germany emerged as a unified nation-state in 1871 following the Franco-Prussian War, under the leadership of Otto von Bismarck and the Prussian monarchy. The German Empire became a major industrial and military power [History.com - German Unification](https://www.history.com/topics/germany/german-unification).
- **20th Century Challenges**: Germany played a central role in both World Wars. After its defeat in World War I (1914–1918), the Treaty of Versailles imposed harsh reparations and territorial losses. The subsequent rise of the Nazi regime under Adolf Hitler led to World War II (1939–1945) and the Holocaust, resulting in millions of deaths and widespread devastation [United States Holocaust Memorial Museum](https://www.ushmm.org/learn/holocaust).
- **Post-War Division and Reunification**: After World War II, Germany was divided into East Germany (under Soviet influence) and West Germany (aligned with Western democracies). The Berlin Wall, constructed in 1961, became a symbol of the Cold War divide. Reunification occurred in 1990 following the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, marking a significant turning point in modern European history [BBC - German Reunification](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-16541231).
