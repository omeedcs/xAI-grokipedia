Originating as a phrase coined by activist Tarana Burke in 2006, the movement gained widespread attention in 2017 when it became a viral hashtag on social media, following high-profile allegations of sexual misconduct in the entertainment industry. The movement seeks to challenge systemic power imbalances, advocate for survivors' rights, and foster cultural change regarding gender-based violence. It has sparked conversations across industries, countries, and communities about consent, accountability, and workplace safety.\n\n## Historical Background\n\nThe roots of the MeToo Movement can be traced back to grassroots activism focused on supporting survivors of sexual violence. In 2006, Tarana Burke, an American activist, first used the phrase \"Me Too\" as part of a campaign to help young women of color who had experienced sexual abuse. Burke's initiative aimed to create a sense of solidarity and community among survivors, emphasizing that they were not alone in their struggles [Tarana Burke on MeToo](https://www.ted.com/talks/tarana_burke_me_too_is_a_movement_not_a_moment).\n\nThe movement gained global prominence in October 2017, following allegations of sexual harassment and assault against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. On October 15, 2017, actress Alyssa Milano posted a tweet encouraging survivors to share their stories using the hashtag #MeToo, inspired by Burke's earlier work. Milano's tweet went viral, with millions of people worldwide sharing personal experiences of harassment and assault across platforms like Twitter and Facebook [Alyssa Milano Tweet](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/16/us/harvey-weinstein-sexual-harassment.html). This digital wave amplified the movement, bringing attention to systemic issues of sexual misconduct in various sectors, including entertainment, politics, and corporate environments.\n\nThe MeToo Movement built on earlier feminist movements and campaigns against sexual violence, such as the \"Take Back the Night\" marches of the 1970s and the 1991 Anita Hill testimony during Clarence Thomas's Supreme Court confirmation hearings, which highlighted workplace harassment [Anita Hill Testimony](https://www.history.com/topics/womens-history/anita-hill). However, the scale and immediacy of social media in 2017 distinguished MeToo as a uniquely powerful and accessible platform for survivors.\n\n## Current Status and Relevance\n\nAs of the early 2020s, the MeToo Movement remains a significant force in advocating for systemic change regarding sexual harassment and assault. It has inspired legislative reforms, workplace policy changes, and cultural shifts in how society addresses gender-based violence. Many countries have seen the introduction of stricter laws on sexual harassment, such as India's amendments to workplace safety regulations and France's laws against street harassment [Global Impact of MeToo](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-45827430).\n\nThe movement has also faced challenges, including backlash from those who argue it has led to \"witch hunts\" or false accusations against individuals without due process. Critics have raised concerns about the potential for overreach, while supporters argue that the focus should remain on addressing the pervasive nature of sexual violence and supporting survivors [Criticism of MeToo](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/01/the-backlash-against-metoo/550763/).\n\nHigh-profile cases continue to emerge, sustaining public discourse on the issue. Additionally, the movement has expanded to include discussions of intersectionality, recognizing how race, class, and other factors influence experiences of harassment and access to justice. Tarana Burke and other activists emphasize that MeToo is not just a moment but a sustained movement for cultural and structural change [MeToo Ongoing Work](https://metoomvmt.org/).\n\n## Notable Facts and Details\n\n- **Scale of Participation**: Within 24 hours of Alyssa Milano's tweet in October 2017, the #MeToo hashtag was used over 500,000 times on Twitter and shared by 4.7 million people on Facebook [MeToo Social Media Impact](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2018/04/04/sexual-harassment-online/).\n- **Global Reach**: The movement has inspired localized versions worldwide, such as #BalanceTonPorc in France (\"Expose Your Pig\") and #NiUnaMenos in Latin America (\"Not One Less\"), addressing gender violence in culturally specific contexts [Global Hashtags](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/06/metoo-goes-global-and-changes-the-conversation-on-sexual-harassment).\n- **Legal Outcomes**: The MeToo Movement has led to numerous legal actions, including the conviction of Harvey Weinstein in 2020 on charges of rape and sexual assault, marking a significant moment of accountability [Weinstein Conviction](https://www.npr.org/2020/02/24/808930543/harvey-weinstein-found-guilty-of-rape-sexual-assault-in-metoo-trial).\n- **Workplace Changes**: Many organizations have revised harassment policies, implemented mandatory training, and established reporting mechanisms in response to MeToo, though critics note that enforcement remains inconsistent [Workplace Reforms](https://www.forbes.com/sites/janicegassam/2019/01/28/how-the-metoo-movement-is-changing-workplace-policies/).\n- **Cultural Impact**: The movement has influenced media portrayals of gender dynamics, with increased representation of survivor stories in film, television, and literature, aiming to normalize discussions of consent and trauma [Cultural Shifts](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/metoo-movement-reshapes-hollywood-storytelling-1159876/).\n\n## Related Topics\n\n- **Feminism**: The MeToo Movement is deeply connected to feminist advocacy for gender equality and the eradication of gender-based violence.
