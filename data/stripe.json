Founded in 2010, Stripe has grown to become one of the leading payment platforms, serving millions of businesses worldwide, from small startups to large enterprises. Headquartered in San Francisco, California, with a secondary headquarters in Dublin, Ireland, Stripe is known for its developer-friendly tools and focus on simplifying online commerce.\n\nStripe's mission is to \"increase the GDP of the internet\" by providing infrastructure that makes it easier for businesses to operate and grow online [Stripe Mission](https://stripe.com/about). Its services are integral to the digital economy, supporting e-commerce, subscription-based models, and a wide range of financial operations.\n\n## History and Founding\n\nStripe was founded in 2010 by brothers Patrick and John Collison, originally under the name \"/dev/payments\" before rebranding to Stripe in 2011. The idea emerged from the brothers' frustration with the complexity of existing online payment systems while working on previous entrepreneurial ventures. Patrick Collison, then a student at MIT, and John Collison, studying at Harvard, aimed to create a simpler, more accessible solution for developers to integrate payment processing into their websites and applications [TechCrunch Founding Story](https://techcrunch.com/2011/09/29/stripe-launches-to-simplify-online-payments/).\n\n- **Early Years (2010–2012):** Stripe officially launched its public beta in 2011, quickly gaining traction among developers for its straightforward API and transparent pricing model. By 2012, the company had raised significant venture capital, including a $20 million Series A round led by Sequoia Capital [Forbes Early Funding](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomiogeron/2012/07/09/stripe-raises-20-million-from-general-catalyst-sequoia/).\n- **Growth and Expansion (2013–2018):** Stripe expanded its services beyond basic payment processing to include tools like Stripe Connect (for marketplaces), Stripe Atlas (for company incorporation), and fraud prevention features.
