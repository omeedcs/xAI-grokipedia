# Kevin De Bruyne

Kevin De Bruyne is a Belgian professional footballer who plays as an attacking midfielder for Serie A club Napoli and captains the Belgium national team. He is currently sidelined by injury, with a return expected in early 2026. Born on 28 June 1991 in Drongen, Belgium, he stands at 1.81 meters tall and is right-footed, known for his exceptional vision, precise passing, and long-range shooting ability, establishing him as one of the premier midfielders of his generation.

De Bruyne began his professional career at Genk, making his senior debut at age 17 in 2008 before joining Chelsea in January 2012 for an undisclosed fee. During his time at Chelsea, he was loaned to Werder Bremen for the 2012–13 season, where he scored 10 goals and provided 9 assists in 33 appearances, marking his breakthrough in senior football. He then transferred to VfL Wolfsburg in January 2014 on a five-and-a-half-year contract, helping the club finish second in the Bundesliga in 2015 and earning the German Footballer of the Year award that year.

In August 2015, De Bruyne signed a six-year deal with Manchester City for a club-record €76 million, becoming Belgium's most expensive export at the time, and quickly established himself as a key playmaker under manager Pep Guardiola. Over his 10-year tenure at the Etihad Stadium, he made 422 appearances, scoring 108 goals and recording 177 assists, contributing to 19 major trophies including six Premier League titles, two FA Cups, five EFL Cups, three FA Community Shields, one UEFA Champions League (2022–23), one UEFA Super Cup, and one FIFA Club World Cup. His individual accolades with City include two PFA Players' Player of the Year awards (2019–20, 2020–21), four Manchester City Player of the Season honors, and five Premier League Playmaker of the Season awards for leading the league in assists. In the Premier League specifically, he amassed 288 appearances, 72 goals, and 119 assists.

De Bruyne's international career with Belgium began with his debut on 11 August 2010 in a friendly against Finland, and as of November 2025, he has earned 115 caps and scored 36 goals, surpassing many teammates in experience. As a central figure in Belgium's "golden generation," he scored a long-range strike in the 2018 FIFA World Cup quarter-final against Brazil and two penalties in a 2025 World Cup qualifier against Wales. Belgium achieved third place at the 2018 World Cup under his influence, reached the quarter-finals at UEFA EURO 2016 (where he provided three assists), and advanced to the quarter-finals at the 2022 World Cup, though they exited in the group stage at EURO 2024.

Seeking a new challenge at age 34, De Bruyne left Manchester City as a free agent in 2025 and joined Napoli on 12 June 2025, one of the most prominent transfers in Serie A history over the past two decades, where he wears the No. 11 shirt and has already contributed in World Cup qualifying for Belgium, who top their group as of November 2025. His career totals reflect a legacy of creativity, with over 300 direct goal involvements in top-flight leagues and consistent recognition in teams of the year, including multiple FIFA FIFPro World XI selections and UEFA Team of the Year inclusions.

## Early life and youth career

### Early life

Kevin De Bruyne was born on 28 June 1991 in Drongen, a suburb of Ghent in the East Flanders province of Belgium. His mother, Anna De Bruyne, was born in Burundi and later managed family oil businesses in Burundi and the Ivory Coast, while his father, Herwig De Bruyne, is a Belgian businessman with a strong passion for football. The family settled in Drongen in 1993 after time in Burundi, the Ivory Coast, and England due to the oil business. De Bruyne has one younger sister, Stefanie, and his parents provided a supportive home with a garden that served as an early play area.

From a young age, De Bruyne displayed a keen interest in football, often requesting a ball as his only toy, as recalled by his father Herwig, who served as a mentor and encouraged his son's development in the sport. He attended local schools in the East Flanders region, balancing education with his growing enthusiasm for the game. De Bruyne's early non-professional football experiences began around age six, when he joined the amateur club KVV Drongen in his hometown, playing in local youth tournaments and honing his ambidextrous skills on both feet.

### Youth career

De Bruyne began his organized youth football at local club VV Drongen before joining the Gent academy in 1999 at the age of eight, where he spent the next six years developing his skills. At Gent, he displayed early promise as a midfielder but clashed with coaching styles that emphasized discipline over creativity, leading to a challenging period marked by his stubborn personality. His youth coach at Gent, Frank De Leyn, later recalled De Bruyne's determination, noting, "He was stubborn as hell, like a mule, but I also think that it is that stubbornness... that has made him the player he is now."

In 2005, at age 14, De Bruyne left Gent for rivals Genk's youth academy, attracted by their more attacking and possession-based approach that better suited his playing style. At Genk, he rapidly progressed, often playing in higher age groups and honing his role as an attacking midfielder known for precise passing and vision. By 2007, at age 16, he had integrated into the club's youth setup, participating in first-team training sessions that accelerated his technical growth.

De Bruyne made his first appearances for Genk's reserves in 2008 at age 17, showcasing standout performances that highlighted his potential, including key crosses and assists in matches alongside emerging talents like Christian Benteke. These reserve outings, where he contributed to several goals through his playmaking, paved the way for his breakthrough to the senior squad, demonstrating his ability to dictate play from midfield in competitive settings. No youth loans or trials were recorded during this period, as his development remained focused within Genk's academy structure.

## Club career

### Genk (2008–2012)

De Bruyne made his professional debut for Genk on 9 May 2009, coming on as a substitute in a 3–0 league defeat to Charleroi. He scored his first professional goal for the club on 7 February 2010, securing a 1–0 victory over Sint-Truiden in the Belgian Pro League.

In the 2009–10 season, De Bruyne established himself in the first team, making 31 league appearances, scoring 2 goals, and providing 3 assists as Genk finished seventh in the Belgian Pro League. His breakthrough came during the 2010–11 campaign, where he featured in 32 league matches, netting 5 goals and recording 11 assists, playing a pivotal role in Genk's title-winning season—their third Belgian Pro League championship. This performance highlighted his emerging vision and creativity in midfield, contributing significantly to the team's success.

De Bruyne's form continued to elevate in the 2011–12 season, with 8 goals and 11 assists in 28 league appearances. A standout moment was on 29 October 2011, when he scored his first professional hat-trick in a thrilling 5–4 league victory over rivals Club Brugge, demonstrating his clinical finishing and composure under pressure. These performances solidified his reputation as one of Belgium's most promising talents, drawing attention from European clubs.

Over his time at Genk from 2008 to 2012, De Bruyne made 113 appearances across all competitions, scoring 17 goals and providing 36 assists.

### Chelsea (2012–2014)

De Bruyne joined Chelsea from Genk in January 2012 for a reported fee of £6.7 million, signing a five-and-a-half-year contract. He was immediately loaned back to his former club for the remainder of the 2011–12 season to continue his development.

Upon returning to Chelsea in the summer of 2012, De Bruyne experienced limited playing time under successive managers André Villas-Boas, Roberto Di Matteo, and Rafael Benítez during the 2012–13 season. He featured in just three cup ties before being sent on loan to Werder Bremen in August 2012, with no league appearances that year.

In the 2013–14 season, following his loan return, De Bruyne made six Premier League appearances under José Mourinho, bringing his total league games for Chelsea to nine across both seasons, with one assist. He also appeared in three League Cup matches and three Champions League group stage games, often as a substitute.

Despite brief moments of promise, such as his substitute appearance and assist for Juan Mata in the 6–0 League Cup win over Wolverhampton Wanderers on 25 September 2012, De Bruyne grew frustrated with the lack of trust from management and limited opportunities. This led to him requesting a loan move in late 2013 to gain regular playing time, though he ultimately departed permanently for VfL Wolfsburg in January 2014. De Bruyne later cited the low transfer fee as contributing to his marginalization, noting Mourinho provided no explanation for his bench role despite initial chances.

### Werder Bremen (loan, 2012–2013)

On 31 July 2012, Chelsea agreed to loan Kevin De Bruyne to Werder Bremen for the 2012–13 Bundesliga season, providing the 21-year-old Belgian with regular first-team opportunities after limited playing time at Stamford Bridge. The move allowed De Bruyne to adapt to the physical and tactical demands of German football under manager Thomas Schaaf, who praised the youngster's vision and technical ability, granting him creative freedom in midfield to showcase his passing range and long-range shooting. Despite initial cultural adjustments—De Bruyne once described Germans as "stiff" in an interview, though he quickly clarified his growing comfort with the league's intensity—he integrated effectively, starting in most matches and contributing to Bremen's survival efforts in a challenging season.

De Bruyne's impact was immediate and sustained, as he made 33 appearances in the Bundesliga, scoring 10 goals and providing 9 assists. His performances highlighted his versatility, often operating as an attacking midfielder or on the right wing, where his precise crosses and set-piece delivery proved vital. Key highlights included a brace in a 4–1 away victory over VfB Stuttgart in February 2013, which helped Bremen secure crucial points in their relegation battle, and two assists in a 2–0 win against TSG 1899 Hoffenheim in December 2012. Another standout moment came on the final day against 1. FC Nürnberg in May 2013, where his two goals in a 3–2 defeat for Bremen nonetheless demonstrated his clinical finishing under pressure. These contributions earned him the Bundesliga Young Player of the Year award, recognizing his emergence as one of the league's most promising talents.

Schaaf's faith in De Bruyne was evident, with the coach publicly expressing a desire to retain him beyond the loan, stating it would be "kind of stupid" not to pursue a permanent deal given his influence on the team's attack. De Bruyne reciprocated the support, later crediting the Bremen staff for elevating his game to a new level through consistent minutes and tactical trust. However, with the loan set to expire on 30 June 2013 and no option to extend, De Bruyne returned to Chelsea, having revitalized his career in Germany.

### VfL Wolfsburg (2014–2015)

De Bruyne completed a permanent transfer to VfL Wolfsburg from Chelsea in January 2014 for a reported fee of €22 million, marking a significant investment by the club in the young midfielder. Having gained prior experience in the Bundesliga during his loan at Werder Bremen, he integrated swiftly into the team under manager Dieter Hecking.

In the latter half of the 2013–14 season, De Bruyne adapted effectively, appearing in 16 Bundesliga matches where he scored 3 goals and registered 6 assists, helping Wolfsburg finish fifth and secure Europa League qualification.

The 2014–15 campaign saw De Bruyne emerge as a star, delivering a career-defining performance with 10 goals and a Bundesliga-record 21 assists in 34 league appearances, propelling Wolfsburg to a second-place finish and their first Champions League qualification in five years. Across all competitions that season, he amassed 16 goals and 27 assists in 51 games, showcasing his vision, passing accuracy, and long-range shooting. His contributions were instrumental in Wolfsburg's DFB-Pokal triumph, including a stunning long-range strike that opened the scoring in the 3–1 final win over Borussia Dortmund on 30 May 2015.

De Bruyne's exceptional form earned him the Bundesliga Player of the Season award in 2015, as voted by journalists. Over his 18-month stint at Wolfsburg from January 2014 through the end of the 2014–15 season, he recorded 20 goals and 37 assists in 73 appearances across all competitions.

### Manchester City (2015–2025)

Kevin De Bruyne joined Manchester City from VfL Wolfsburg on 30 August 2015, signing a six-year contract for a club-record fee of £55 million. This transfer marked him as one of the most expensive players in Premier League history at the time, reflecting his standout performances in the Bundesliga where he had recorded 10 goals and 21 assists in the previous season. De Bruyne made his debut in a 2–0 League Cup win over Watford on 23 September 2015, quickly establishing himself as a creative force under manager Manuel Pellegrini.

In his debut 2015–16 season, De Bruyne adapted to the Premier League, contributing 16 goals and 13 assists across 41 appearances in all competitions, helping City secure the League Cup—their first major trophy in his tenure. The following year, under new manager Pep Guardiola, he elevated his game with 7 goals and 20 assists in 49 matches during 2016–17, though City finished third in the league. By 2017–18, De Bruyne's influence peaked in domestic play, recording 12 goals and 21 assists in 52 appearances; his vision and passing were instrumental in City's record-breaking 100-point Premier League season, where they won the title by 19 points alongside the League Cup. That campaign, he earned the Premier League Player of the Season award for his pivotal role in the attack.

The 2018–19 season brought challenges as De Bruyne suffered a hamstring injury in September, limiting him to 32 appearances, 4 goals, and 11 assists, yet City still achieved a domestic treble of the Premier League, FA Cup, and League Cup. He returned strongly in 2019–20 despite another hamstring issue, posting 16 goals and a Premier League-record 20 assists in 48 matches, earning the PFA Players' Player of the Year award and another Premier League Player of the Season honor. This form contributed to City's second consecutive Premier League title, plus the FA Cup and League Cup. De Bruyne signed a two-year contract extension in April 2021, committing to the club until 2025 and expressing his ambition to take on a leadership role.

Injuries continued to test De Bruyne's resilience; a lateral ankle ligament tear in 2020–21 restricted him to 40 appearances, but he still managed 10 goals and 18 assists, aiding City's fourth Premier League title and another League Cup win. By 2021–22, he adapted to a more advanced hybrid role, scoring a career-high 19 goals alongside 15 assists in 45 games, though City lost the Champions League final to Chelsea. The 2022–23 season saw him deliver 10 goals and a career-best 31 assists in 49 appearances, including key contributions in the Champions League triumph over Inter Milan in Istanbul—City's first European Cup. This victory completed a Premier League and FA Cup double, with De Bruyne's long-range passing often dictating play.

De Bruyne's later years showcased sustained excellence amid physical demands. In 2023–24, hamstring problems limited him to 26 appearances, 6 goals, and 18 assists, but City defended their Premier League title and added the UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup. His final 2024–25 season yielded 6 goals and 8 assists in 40 matches, as City secured their third consecutive Premier League title (and seventh overall) before his departure. On 4 April 2025, De Bruyne announced he would leave upon the expiration of his contract, ending a decade at the club without a new extension offer despite earlier captaincy discussions.

Over 422 appearances for Manchester City, De Bruyne scored 108 goals and provided 177 assists, playing a central role in seven Premier League titles, one Champions League, five League Cups, two FA Cups, and other honors. His assist tally set multiple records, including the fastest to 100 Premier League assists (in 237 games), underscoring his evolution from promising midfielder to one of the league's greatest playmakers.

### Napoli (2025–present)

In the summer of 2025, Kevin De Bruyne joined SSC Napoli on a free transfer following the expiry of his Manchester City contract. The 34-year-old Belgian midfielder signed a two-year deal, seeking a new challenge in Serie A after a decade of success in the Premier League. His arrival bolstered Napoli's squad under manager Antonio Conte, who had led the club to the 2024–25 Scudetto, positioning De Bruyne as a key creative force in the reigning champions' title defense.

De Bruyne made his competitive debut for Napoli in a pre-season friendly against Arezzo on 22 July 2025, though the match ended in a 2–0 defeat. His Serie A bow came on 23 August 2025 against Sassuolo, where he marked the occasion by scoring Napoli's second goal in a 2–0 victory, assisting in the team's strong start to the 2025–26 campaign. By early November 2025, De Bruyne had featured in eight Serie A matches, contributing four goals while adapting to Conte's tactical demands, which emphasize disciplined positioning and quick transitions compared to his freer role at Manchester City. His integration has been gradual, with Conte noting adjustments to De Bruyne's preference for orchestrating play from deeper areas rather than frequent box runs.

De Bruyne's impact has been instrumental in Napoli's early-season form, as the club topped the Serie A table with 22 points from 10 matches by November 2025, mounting a strong Scudetto challenge. In the UEFA Champions League group stage, he provided two assists across three appearances, including a goalless but solid performance in Napoli's 0–0 draw against Eintracht Frankfurt on 4 November 2025 at the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona. Despite a recent thigh injury sustained during a 3–1 Serie A win over Inter Milan on 28 October 2025, which briefly sidelined him, De Bruyne's experience has helped stabilize Napoli's midfield amid their pursuit of domestic and European success. As of 20 November 2025, he has recovered and continued to contribute in subsequent matches.

At age 34, De Bruyne's market value has declined to €20 million, reflecting his advancing years and the physical demands of elite football, though his on-pitch contributions continue to underscore his enduring quality.

## International career

### Youth international career (2010–2013)

De Bruyne received his first call-up to the Belgium under-18 national team in 2009, marking the beginning of his youth international career. He made his debut for the side on 10 March 2009 in a 1–2 friendly defeat to Switzerland. Over the course of his time with the U18s, he earned 7 caps and scored 1 goal.

In 2009, De Bruyne progressed to the Belgium under-19 team, where he made his debut on 11 May 2009. He featured prominently in the 2010 UEFA European Under-19 Championship qualifying round, scoring the opening goal in a 4–0 home win against Andorra on 13 November 2009, which helped secure Belgium's advancement to the elite round. In total, De Bruyne recorded 10 caps and 1 goal for the U19s during this period.

De Bruyne made his senior international debut for the Belgium national team on 11 August 2010, coming on as a substitute in a 0–1 friendly defeat to Finland in Turku. Despite early promise, his involvement remained limited over the next few years due to competition for midfield positions and club commitments, with only sporadic appearances until his breakthrough in 2014, when he established himself as a core player under coach Marc Wilmots.

De Bruyne played a pivotal role in Belgium's run to the quarter-finals at the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil, featuring in all five matches for the Red Devils. He marked his tournament with a goal and an assist in the round-of-16 clash against the United States on 1 July, scoring a decisive 92nd-minute strike in extra time to seal a 2–1 victory after assisting Romelu Lukaku earlier in the game. Belgium's campaign ended in the quarter-finals with a 0–0 draw against Argentina, lost on penalties, but De Bruyne's dynamic play in central midfield, combining vision and long-range passing, highlighted his growing influence on the international stage.

In UEFA Euro 2016, De Bruyne participated in all five of Belgium's fixtures as they topped Group E before exiting in the round of 16. He scored once during the group stage, netting the winner in a 1–0 victory over Sweden on 22 June with a composed finish from the edge of the box in the 25th minute. Additionally, he provided three assists, including key contributions in the 3–0 win against the Republic of Ireland on 18 June, where his deliveries set up goals for Axel Witsel and Romelu Lukaku. Belgium's tournament concluded with a 1–3 defeat to Wales in the knockout stage, despite De Bruyne's creative efforts in attempting to break down their defense.

De Bruyne's standout performances continued at the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia, where he started all seven games and anchored Belgium's midfield during their historic third-place finish—the nation's best World Cup result since 1986. He contributed one goal and three assists, with his long-range strike in the 31st minute of the quarter-final against Brazil on 6 July proving decisive in a 2–1 upset victory, while also assisting Eden Hazard's opener in the same match. His earlier assists came against Panama (for Dries Mertens) and Japan (for Marouane Fellaini) in the group and round-of-16 stages, respectively, showcasing his ability to dictate play and deliver precise crosses. Belgium advanced to the semi-finals before a 0–1 loss to France, then secured bronze with a 2–0 win over England, where De Bruyne's composure under pressure earned him inclusion in the FIFA Fan Dream Team. By the end of 2018, De Bruyne had amassed 80 caps for Belgium, scoring 15 goals in total.

### Senior international career (2018–present)

De Bruyne played a pivotal role for Belgium at UEFA Euro 2020, appearing in four matches after recovering from a facial fracture sustained in the UEFA Champions League final. He scored his sole goal of the tournament in a 2-1 group stage victory over Denmark on 17 June 2021, curling a superb left-footed strike into the top corner from 25 yards to secure the win in Copenhagen. His performances earned him the Player of the Match award for that game, highlighting his vision and passing range in midfield. Belgium advanced to the quarter-finals but were eliminated 2-1 by Italy on 2 August 2021, with De Bruyne's tireless display unable to prevent the Azzurri's progression.

At the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, De Bruyne featured in all four of Belgium's fixtures, scoring once as the team exited in the round of 16. He opened the scoring in a 1-0 group stage win against Canada on 23 November 2022 with a powerful 25-yard drive, becoming the first Belgian to score in three consecutive World Cups. Belgium's campaign ended with a 0-2 defeat to Germany in the round of 16 on 29 November 2022, where De Bruyne's creativity was notable but insufficient against a resilient opponent.

In March 2023, following Eden Hazard's international retirement in 2019 and amid transitions in the squad, De Bruyne was appointed Belgium's permanent captain by coach Domenico Tedesco, succeeding Toby Alderweireld and reflecting his growing leadership stature. Under his captaincy, Belgium topped their UEFA Euro 2024 qualifying group, with De Bruyne contributing key assists in victories such as a 3-0 win over Sweden in March 2023. At the tournament proper in Germany, he led the team in four matches, scoring once in a crucial 2-0 group stage win against Romania on 22 June 2024, finishing emphatically after a through ball from Youri Tielemans. Belgium reached the round of 16 but suffered a 1-0 loss to France on 1 July 2024, prompting De Bruyne to question the "Golden Generation" label post-match while affirming his commitment to international football.

In September 2025, following a coaching change, De Bruyne was replaced as captain by Youri Tielemans under new coach Rudi Garcia. As of November 2025, De Bruyne has amassed 115 caps for Belgium, scoring 36 goals and providing numerous assists, solidifying his status as one of the nation's most prolific midfielders. In the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, he was instrumental, netting six goals—including a brace of penalties in a 4-2 victory over Wales on 13 October 2025—and delivering an assist across six appearances, helping Belgium secure top position in Group J and qualify for the tournament on 18 November 2025. His leadership has been central to bridging Belgium's "Golden Generation" to a younger cohort, with coach Rudi Garcia praising his experience amid squad evolution. De Bruyne's ongoing contributions underscore his role in sustaining Belgium's competitiveness ahead of the 2026 World Cup.

## Playing style and reception

### Playing style

Kevin De Bruyne primarily functions as an advanced playmaker and attacking midfielder, often deployed in central positions or on the right wing to maximize his creative influence. His positional versatility enables him to shift into roles such as a false nine or number 10, adapting seamlessly to tactical systems that emphasize fluid attacking patterns. Under managers like Pep Guardiola, this flexibility has allowed him to operate across the frontline, linking midfield and attack while exploiting half-spaces and inside channels.

De Bruyne's strengths lie in his exceptional vision for long-range passes and crossing accuracy, enabling him to deliver penetrating through-balls and back-post crosses that dismantle defenses. He has demonstrated this prowess with a career-high 20 assists in the 2019-20 Premier League season, underscoring his role as a prolific chance creator. Additionally, his shooting from distance, characterized by powerful strikes with minimal backlift, and his dribbling in tight spaces further enhance his offensive threat, allowing him to beat opponents technically and contribute directly to goals. These attributes have made him a four-time Premier League assist leader, highlighting his precision in set-piece delivery and transitions.

Despite his technical brilliance, De Bruyne's occasional injury proneness has impacted his stamina and availability, leading to periods of reduced output during recovery. He is also less effective in defensive duties, with his pressing more ferocious in short bursts than sustained over long distances against agile opponents. This has occasionally limited his involvement in high-intensity pressing phases.

De Bruyne's style has evolved significantly from a box-to-box midfielder in his youth, where he balanced defensive and offensive responsibilities, to a central creative hub under Guardiola. This progression has refined his off-ball movement, tactical awareness, and synergy with forwards like Erling Haaland, transforming him into a more positionally intelligent orchestrator of play. He is often compared to David Silva for his ability to thrive as a dual number 10 in central areas, blending vision with subtle movement to control games.

### Reception and legacy

Kevin De Bruyne has received widespread acclaim from peers and managers for his exceptional vision and creativity on the pitch. Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola, under whom De Bruyne played for a decade, has repeatedly praised him as one of the world's elite midfielders, once describing him as "the best in the world" following a standout performance against Sporting CP in 2024. De Bruyne's individual recognition includes winning the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) Players' Player of the Year award in both the 2019–20 and 2020–21 seasons, becoming only the third player to achieve back-to-back honors after Thierry Henry and Cristiano Ronaldo. These accolades underscore his pivotal role in Manchester City's dominance, where his precise passing and playmaking elevated the team's attacking prowess.

De Bruyne has consistently featured among the top contenders in major individual rankings. He finished third in the 2022 Ballon d'Or, behind Karim Benzema and Sadio Mané, after leading Manchester City to the Premier League title with 15 goals and 16 assists across all competitions. In 2023, he placed fourth, having contributed 10 goals and 32 assists in the treble-winning campaign. For the UEFA Men's Player of the Year award, De Bruyne has been shortlisted multiple times, including in 2020 alongside Robert Lewandowski and Manuel Neuer, in 2021 with N'Golo Kanté and Jorginho, and in 2023 with Lionel Messi and Erling Haaland, reflecting his influence in European competitions.

De Bruyne's legacy is marked by his transformative impact on modern midfield play, particularly through his assist records in the Premier League. He set the single-season benchmark with 20 assists in 2019–20 and became the fastest player to reach 100 Premier League assists, achieving the milestone in just 237 games—56 fewer than the previous record holder. By 2025, his tally stood at 119 assists, placing him second all-time behind Ryan Giggs and establishing him as a benchmark for aspiring midfielders who prioritize vision and tempo control over goal-scoring flair. In Belgium's golden generation, De Bruyne served as a linchpin, driving the team to the 2018 World Cup semifinals and inspiring a cohort of technically gifted players, though the group ultimately fell short of major tournament glory amid high expectations.

Despite his achievements, De Bruyne has faced criticisms centered on persistent injuries that have interrupted his consistency, with hamstring and thigh issues sidelining him for significant periods, including a complex thigh injury in late 2024 that raised concerns over his availability. Some observers have noted an underappreciation of his contributions relative to prolific forwards, attributing this to the midfield role's less visible spotlight in media narratives, even as pundits like Jamie Redknapp have lauded him as potentially one of the Premier League's greatest midfielders ever.

Following his departure from Manchester City in 2025, De Bruyne joined Napoli on a free transfer, signing a two-year deal with an option for extension at age 34, a move viewed by some as a graceful entry into the career twilight amid ongoing injury challenges. In November 2025, he underwent successful surgery on a thigh injury sustained earlier in the season, confirming a lengthy absence but affirming his commitment to contributing to Napoli's ambitions in Serie A. This phase has prompted reflections on his enduring influence, with contemporaries recognizing him as one of Manchester City's all-time greats despite the physical toll of his high-intensity style.

## Personal life

### Family and relationships

Kevin De Bruyne married his wife, Michèle Lacroix, in June 2017 in Sorrento, Italy, following their engagement in December 2016 at the Eiffel Tower in Paris. The couple first connected in 2014 through a Twitter (now X) interaction, when De Bruyne's friend noticed Lacroix had liked one of his posts and encouraged him to reach out, leading to their relationship.

De Bruyne and Lacroix have three children: sons Mason Milian, born on 10 March 2016, and Rome, born on 31 October 2018, as well as daughter Suri, born in September 2020.

From 2015 to 2025, the family made their home in Manchester during De Bruyne's time with Manchester City, where Lacroix offered consistent support through his demanding schedule and frequent travels. In 2025, after De Bruyne's transfer to Napoli, the family relocated to Naples, a decision shaped by Lacroix's enthusiasm for the Italian lifestyle and the couple's sentimental ties to the region from their wedding. De Bruyne involved his children in discussions about the move to ensure their comfort with the change.

The family prioritizes privacy in personal matters, though Lacroix shares occasional family moments on her Instagram account, balancing public glimpses with a focus on their private life.

### Philanthropy and endorsements

In 2020, Kevin De Bruyne established the Kevin De Bruyne Foundation, dedicated to supporting and empowering disadvantaged children and young people in Belgium through educational and developmental programs.
