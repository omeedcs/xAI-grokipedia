# Russian Invasion of Ukraine

## Overview

The Russian Invasion of Ukraine, also referred to as the Russo-Ukrainian War, is a large-scale military conflict that began on February 24, 2022, when Russia launched a full-scale military operation against Ukraine. This invasion marked a significant escalation of the ongoing conflict between the two nations, which had been simmering since 2014 following Russia's annexation of Crimea and its support for separatist movements in eastern Ukraine. The 2022 invasion is considered one of the largest military operations in Europe since World War II, resulting in widespread destruction, significant loss of life, and a massive humanitarian crisis [BBC News](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-60504334).

The conflict has drawn international condemnation, with many countries imposing economic sanctions on Russia, providing military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine, and accepting millions of Ukrainian refugees. It has also reshaped global geopolitics, affecting energy markets, food security, and international alliances such as NATO and the European Union [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/24/russia-invades-ukraine-what-we-know-so-far).

## Historical Background

The roots of the Russian Invasion of Ukraine lie in a complex history of political, cultural, and territorial disputes between the two nations, compounded by broader geopolitical tensions.

- **Post-Soviet Relations**: After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Ukraine gained independence, but its relationship with Russia remained strained. Ukraine sought closer ties with the European Union and NATO, while Russia viewed Ukraine as part of its historical sphere of influence [Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/ukraine-conflict-russias-border).
- **2014 Crisis**: Tensions escalated in 2014 following Ukraine's Euromaidan protests, which led to the ousting of pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych. In response, Russia annexed Crimea, a Ukrainian territory, in March 2014, an action widely condemned as illegal under international law. Simultaneously, Russia supported separatist groups in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, leading to the ongoing war in Donbas [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/timeline-key-events-ukraine-russia-crisis-2022-02-23/).
- **Build-Up to 2022**: In the years leading up to 2022, Russia massed troops near Ukraine's borders, citing concerns over NATO expansion and alleging threats to Russian-speaking populations in Ukraine. Diplomatic efforts to de-escalate failed, culminating in Russia's recognition of the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics as independent states on February 21, 2022, just days before the invasion [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/2/21/timeline-a-look-at-the-build-up-to-russia-ukraine-conflict).

## Current Status and Relevance

As of late 2023, the Russian Invasion of Ukraine remains an active and unresolved conflict. Key developments include:

- **Military Situation**: The war has seen intense fighting across multiple fronts, with Ukraine launching counteroffensives to reclaim territories occupied by Russian forces, particularly in the Kharkiv and Kherson regions. Russia has maintained control over parts of eastern and southern Ukraine, including Crimea [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/15/europe/ukraine-counteroffensive-russia-war-intl/index.html).
- **Humanitarian Impact**: The conflict has displaced millions of Ukrainians, with over 8 million people internally displaced and nearly 8 million seeking refuge in other countries as of mid-2023. Civilian casualties are in the tens of thousands, and widespread reports of war crimes, including attacks on civilian infrastructure, have emerged [UNHCR](https://www.unhcr.org/news/briefing-notes/ukraine-refugee-situation-update).
- **Global Implications**: The invasion has disrupted global energy and food markets, as Ukraine and Russia are major exporters of grain and energy resources. Western sanctions on Russia have strained its economy, while military aid to Ukraine, including from the United States and European nations, has intensified geopolitical divides [World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2022/06/07/how-the-war-in-ukraine-is-affecting-global-food-security).
- **Diplomatic Efforts**: Peace talks have been sporadic and largely unsuccessful, with both sides maintaining firm positions. International organizations like the United Nations have called for ceasefires and humanitarian corridors, but a resolution remains elusive [United Nations](https://www.un.org/en/story/2023/02/1133847).

The conflict's relevance extends beyond Ukraine, influencing discussions on international law, sovereignty, and the role of global powers in regional conflicts. It has also prompted debates over NATO's eastward expansion and the future of European security architecture.
