  "content": "# Stroke\n\nA stroke, also known as a cerebrovascular accident (CVA), is a medical emergency in which the blood supply to part of the brain is suddenly interrupted or reduced, preventing brain tissue from receiving oxygen and nutrients, which leads to rapid death of brain cells and potential long-term disability or death. There are two primary types: **ischemic stroke**, which comprises approximately 87% of cases and occurs when a blood vessel supplying the brain is blocked by a clot or plaque buildup, and **hemorrhagic stroke**, which involves bleeding from a ruptured blood vessel in or around the brain due to factors like high blood pressure or aneurysms. A third type, **transient ischemic attack (TIA)** or \"mini-stroke,\" involves a temporary blockage causing stroke-like symptoms that resolve within minutes to hours without permanent damage but signals a high risk for future strokes.\n\nCommon symptoms of stroke appear suddenly and may include numbness or weakness in the face, arm, or leg (especially on one side of the body), confusion, trouble speaking or understanding speech, vision disturbances, dizziness, loss of balance, or a severe headache with no known cause. The **FAST** acronym—**F**ace drooping, **A**rm weakness, **S**peech difficulty, and **T**ime to call emergency services—serves as a quick tool to recognize these signs and prompt immediate medical attention, as timely treatment can minimize brain damage. Complications from stroke often include paralysis, cognitive impairments, emotional changes, and difficulties with swallowing or daily activities, affecting survivors' quality of life.\n\nGlobally, stroke is the second leading cause of death and the leading cause of disability, with 11.9 million incident cases annually (as of 2021), resulting in over 7.2 million deaths and 93.8 million people living with the effects of stroke. The global economic burden of stroke exceeds US$890 billion annually (as of 2021), projected to nearly double by 2050, with deaths expected to rise by 50%. In the United States, approximately 795,000 individuals experience a stroke each year, making it the fifth leading cause of death overall (accounting for 1 in 6 cardiovascular deaths) and a leading cause of serious long-term disability, with total costs exceeding $56 billion annually (2019-2020) in healthcare and lost productivity. Risk factors include controllable elements like high blood pressure (the most significant), smoking, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, and physical inactivity, as well as uncontrollable ones such as age over 55, family history, and certain racial or ethnic backgrounds (e.g., higher rates among Black and Hispanic populations). Approximately 80% of strokes are preventable through lifestyle modifications, such as maintaining a healthy diet, regular exercise, and managing chronic conditions, alongside treatments like blood pressure control and anti-clotting medications for at-risk individuals.\n\n## Definition and Classification\n\n### Definition\n\nA stroke is defined as an acute episode of focal cerebral, spinal, or retinal dysfunction caused by vascular injury or disruption of cerebral blood flow, including those lasting less than 24 hours if confirmed by clinical symptoms or neuroimaging evidence of infarction or hemorrhage, and excluding other causes. This sudden interruption of blood flow to the brain deprives neural tissue of essential oxygen and nutrients, resulting in the death of brain cells within minutes if not promptly restored. In contrast, a transient ischemic attack (TIA), often called a \"mini-stroke,\" involves a transient episode of neurological dysfunction caused by focal brain, spinal cord, or retinal ischemia, with no evidence of acute infarction on imaging, though it signals a high risk for future strokes.\n\nThe brain relies on a continuous supply of oxygenated blood delivered primarily through two pairs of major arteries: the internal carotid arteries, which arise from the common carotid arteries in the neck and supply the anterior and middle cerebral hemispheres, and the vertebral arteries, which originate from the subclavian arteries and provide blood to the posterior brain structures via the basilar artery. These vessels form an interconnected network, including the circle of Willis at the base of the brain, to ensure redundant circulation, but any blockage or rupture can critically impair this supply.\n\nAs a medical emergency, stroke ranks as the second leading cause of death worldwide (after ischemic heart disease), accounting for about 10.7% of all global deaths in 2021 (7.3 million deaths), according to Global Burden of Disease Study 2021 data.00369-7/fulltext) Strokes are broadly classified into ischemic (due to vessel blockage) and hemorrhagic (due to vessel rupture) types, though both share the core feature of acute vascular compromise to brain tissue.\n\n### Ischemic Stroke\n\nIschemic stroke is the most common form of stroke, occurring when a blood vessel supplying the brain becomes blocked, preventing adequate blood flow and oxygen delivery to brain tissue, which can lead to cerebral infarction. This blockage is typically caused by a thrombus or embolus obstructing the vessel. It accounts for approximately 87% of all stroke cases in the United States but about 65% globally.00369-7/fulltext)\n\nIschemic strokes are categorized into two primary subtypes based on the origin of the blockage: thrombotic and embolic. In thrombotic strokes, the clot forms locally within a cerebral artery, often as a result of atherosclerosis narrowing the vessel walls over time. Embolic strokes, in contrast, involve a clot or other debris that originates elsewhere in the body—commonly the heart, such as in cases of atrial fibrillation—and travels through the bloodstream to occlude a brain artery.\n\nThe prevalence of ischemic stroke rises significantly with age, affecting older adults at much higher rates due to cumulative vascular risk factors. According to Global Burden of Disease 2021 data, there were approximately 11.9 million new incident stroke cases globally, with ischemic strokes representing the predominant type.00369-7/fulltext) Additionally, silent ischemic strokes—small, asymptomatic infarcts often involving small vessel disease—are frequently detected on neuroimaging and occur in 10% to 20% of the elderly population, contributing to cumulative brain damage without immediate clinical symptoms.\n\n### Hemorrhagic Stroke\n\nHemorrhagic stroke occurs when a weakened blood vessel ruptures, leading to bleeding into the brain tissue or the spaces surrounding it. This rupture disrupts normal brain function by causing direct damage from the accumulation of blood, which increases intracranial pressure and compresses surrounding neural structures. Unlike other stroke types, the bleeding itself is the primary mechanism of injury, often resulting in rapid neurological deterioration.\n\nThe two main subtypes of hemorrhagic stroke are intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), which involves bleeding directly into the brain parenchyma, and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), which entails bleeding into the subarachnoid space surrounding the brain. ICH typically arises from deep penetrating arteries and is more common, accounting for the majority of hemorrhagic events, while SAH often stems from aneurysms or arteriovenous malformations on superficial vessels. These subtypes differ in their anatomical locations and underlying vascular pathologies, influencing clinical presentation and management approaches.\n\nHemorrhagic stroke represents approximately 35% of all strokes globally (ICH ~29%, SAH ~6%), though ~13% in the United States, and contributes disproportionately to stroke-related morbidity and mortality due to its severity. In the United States, recent data indicate that hemorrhagic strokes, including both ICH and SAH, accounted for about 13% of incident cases, with incidence rates showing a gradual decline over the past decades but remaining a significant public health concern. The mortality rate for hemorrhagic stroke is notably higher than for ischemic stroke, ranging from 40% to 50% within the first month, particularly for ICH, where outcomes are influenced by factors such as hemorrhage volume and location.00369-7/fulltext)\n\nA key complication unique to hemorrhagic stroke is hematoma expansion, where the initial bleed enlarges over the first few hours to days, occurring in 20% to 40% of cases and independently associated with increased morbidity and mortality. This expansion exacerbates mass effect and secondary injury through inflammation and ischemia in perihematomal tissues, making early stabilization critical. Hypertension is a primary modifiable risk factor strongly linked to the development of hemorrhagic stroke, as chronic high blood pressure weakens vessel walls over time.\n\n### Other Types\n\nCerebral venous thrombosis (CVT), also known as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, represents a distinct stroke variant characterized by the formation of a blood clot within the cerebral veins or dural sinuses, leading to venous congestion, increased intracranial pressure, and potential infarction due to impaired venous drainage rather than arterial occlusion. This condition differs from typical ischemic strokes by involving venous rather than arterial pathology, often presenting with headaches, seizures, or focal deficits, and it accounts for approximately 0.5% to 3% of all strokes, with an incidence of 0.2 to 0.5 cases per 100,000 people annually. CVT is more prevalent in younger patients, particularly women of childbearing age, and is frequently associated with predisposing factors such as pregnancy, oral contraceptive use, or prothrombotic states.\n\nHypoperfusion strokes arise from global or regional reductions in cerebral blood flow, often triggered by systemic events like cardiac arrest, severe hypotension, or shock, resulting in widespread hypoxic-ischemic injury rather than localized vascular blockage. In such cases, the brain experiences diffuse oxygen deprivation, which can mimic ischemic stroke but is distinguished by its non-focal, symmetric pattern on imaging and its link to extracranial causes like circulatory failure. These events are particularly noted in post-cardiac arrest scenarios, where cerebral blood flow may drop to near zero during the arrest, leading to secondary brain damage upon resuscitation.\n\nWatershed infarcts, another uncommon subtype, occur in the border zones between major cerebral arterial territories, such as between the anterior and middle cerebral arteries, where perfusion is inherently marginal and vulnerable to reductions in blood pressure or flow. These infarcts result from hypoperfusion in these distal areas, often in the context of carotid artery stenosis or systemic hypotension, producing characteristic linear or ribbon-like lesions on MRI that differentiate them from embolic or thrombotic ischemic strokes. Watershed infarcts comprise about 10% of all brain infarcts, though their detection has increased with advanced imaging techniques.\n\nCollectively, these other stroke types—CVT, hypoperfusion-related events, and watershed infarcts—are rare, representing less than 5% of total strokes when excluding dominant arterial ischemic and hemorrhagic forms, though their combined prevalence may vary by population and diagnostic approach. Recent advancements in neuroimaging, including perfusion CT and MRI, have enhanced recognition of these variants as of 2025, allowing for more precise differentiation and timely intervention in subtle cases.\n\n## Signs and Symptoms\n\n### Early Recognition\n\nEarly recognition of stroke is crucial for initiating timely treatment, as delays can significantly worsen outcomes. The FAST acronym, developed by the American Heart Association, serves as a simple tool for identifying key symptoms: **F**ace drooping, where one side of the face droops or is numb when asked to smile; **A**rm weakness, in which one arm drifts downward when both are raised; **S**peech difficulty, characterized by slurred words or trouble understanding speech; and **T**ime to call emergency services immediately upon noticing these signs. An expanded version, BE-FAST, includes **B**alance difficulty or dizziness and **E**yes (sudden vision changes), which helps recognize atypical presentations, particularly in women and the elderly. This mnemonic emphasizes prompt action, as stroke symptoms often appear suddenly and require urgent medical intervention to minimize brain damage.\n\nThe \"time is brain\" concept underscores the urgency, highlighting that brain tissue is rapidly lost during ischemia, with an estimated 1.9 million neurons dying every minute without treatment in typical ischemic strokes. This neuronal loss translates to substantial functional deficits, reinforcing the need for immediate response to enable interventions like thrombolysis within narrow therapeutic windows.\n\nPrehospital delays remain a major barrier worldwide, with median times from symptom onset to hospital arrival varying widely; for example, around 2.3 hours in the United States but often exceeding 12 hours globally, particularly in low-resource settings. Such delays often stem from symptom misrecognition or logistical challenges, preventing a significant proportion of patients from receiving time-critical therapies.\n\nAtypical presentations can further complicate early identification, particularly in women and the elderly, who may exhibit non-focal symptoms like sudden confusion, generalized weakness, or altered mental status rather than classic focal deficits. In elderly patients, symptoms such as dizziness or loss of balance are more common, potentially leading to underdiagnosis if not evaluated promptly.\n\n### Motor and Sensory Deficits\n\nMotor and sensory deficits are among the most prevalent and debilitating consequences of stroke, affecting a majority of survivors and significantly impacting daily functioning and quality of life. Approximately 80% of stroke survivors experience motor impairments, with hemiparesis being the most common manifestation, while sensory deficits occur in 50-80% of cases, often leading to altered perception and increased fall risk. These deficits arise primarily from damage to corticospinal tracts, sensory pathways, or cerebellar structures, depending on the stroke location, and can persist long-term without targeted rehabilitation.\n\nHemiparesis, characterized by weakness on one side of the body, or hemiplegia, involving complete paralysis, typically affects the side contralateral to the brain lesion due to the decussation of corticospinal tracts in the medulla. In supratentorial strokes, such as those in the middle cerebral artery territory, upper limb involvement is particularly frequent, occurring in over 80% of cases and often resulting in reduced grip strength and fine motor control. Lower limb hemiparesis contributes to gait instability, with prevalence rates around 72% for lower extremity weakness in acute settings.\n\nSensory deficits following stroke commonly include contralateral numbness or loss of sensation to touch, temperature, and proprioception, stemming from disruption of the spinothalamic and lemniscal pathways. In thalamic strokes, survivors may develop central post-stroke pain syndrome, affecting up to 40% acutely, characterized by burning or aching sensations due to deafferentation in the ventral posterior nucleus. Hemispatial neglect, a profound sensory inattention to one side of space, often the left, can also emerge, particularly from right thalamic or parietal lesions, leading to unawareness of affected limbs and environmental stimuli.\n\nAtaxia and coordination problems manifest as intention tremor, dysmetria, or unsteady gait when strokes involve the cerebellum or brainstem, where approximately 86% of brainstem stroke patients exhibit ataxia due to impaired pontine and medullary control of movement patterning. Cerebellar infarcts, comprising about 3% of ischemic strokes, frequently cause ipsilateral limb ataxia and truncal instability, exacerbating balance issues and limiting ambulation. These coordination deficits compound motor weaknesses, with rehabilitation focusing on repetitive task-specific training to promote neuroplasticity and partial recovery.\n\n### Cognitive and Visual Impairments\n\nCognitive impairments are common following stroke, affecting multiple domains such as memory, attention, and executive function, with prevalence estimates ranging from 30% to 70% of survivors within the first year post-event. These deficits often arise from damage to brain regions involved in higher-order processing, including the frontal and temporal lobes, and can persist or worsen over time, contributing to reduced independence and quality of life. Memory impairment, for instance, affects 23% to 55% of patients three months after stroke, declining to 11% to 31% by one year, while attention deficits are prevalent in up to 50% of cases and hinder daily activities like reading or driving.\n\nAphasia, a language-related cognitive deficit, occurs in approximately 25% to 30% of stroke survivors and manifests as difficulties in speaking, understanding, reading, or writing. Broca's aphasia, resulting from lesions in the frontal lobe's Broca's area, is characterized by non-fluent, effortful speech with impaired grammar and short phrases, though comprehension remains relatively intact. In contrast, Wernicke's aphasia, stemming from damage to the temporal lobe's Wernicke's area, produces fluent but nonsensical speech with poor comprehension and frequent paraphasias, where incorrect words are substituted.\n\nSpatial neglect, another key cognitive impairment, involves failure to attend to stimuli on the contralateral side of the lesion, most commonly the left side after right hemisphere strokes affecting the parietal lobe. This syndrome impacts up to 80% of patients with acute right middle cerebral artery strokes and can lead to behaviors such as ignoring one side of the body or space during tasks like eating or dressing.\n\nVisual impairments post-stroke frequently include homonymous hemianopia, a loss of half the visual field in both eyes due to lesions in the occipital lobe or optic radiations. This defect affects 20% to 30% of stroke patients and arises from disrupted visual processing pathways, often without awareness of the deficit, complicating navigation and increasing fall risk. Recovery is partial in about half of cases, particularly in younger patients or those with ischemic etiology.\n\n## Causes and Risk Factors\n\n### Underlying Causes\n\nStroke arises from disruptions in cerebral blood flow or vessel integrity, primarily classified into ischemic stroke (due to thrombotic occlusion, embolic events, or systemic hypoperfusion) and hemorrhagic stroke (due to vessel rupture). These etiological pathways account for the majority of cases, with ischemic strokes comprising approximately 87% and hemorrhagic strokes making up the remainder. Rare genetic conditions, such as cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), represent additional hereditary contributors that weaken cerebral vasculature over time.\n\nThrombotic strokes occur when atherosclerotic plaques within cerebral arteries rupture, leading to local thrombus formation and subsequent vessel occlusion. Atherosclerosis involves the buildup of lipid-rich plaques in arterial walls, particularly in large vessels like the internal carotid or middle cerebral arteries, which narrows the lumen and promotes platelet aggregation and clotting upon plaque instability. This process reduces blood flow to downstream brain tissue, causing ischemia and infarction, often in a stepwise manner known as stroke-in-evolution.\n\nEmbolic strokes result from the dislodgement of thrombi or other material from proximal sources, which travel through the bloodstream to occlude cerebral arteries. Common cardiac sources include atrial fibrillation, where irregular heart rhythms foster intra-atrial clot formation in the left atrial appendage, leading to emboli release during cardioversion or spontaneous dislodgement. Other origins encompass valvular heart disease or paradoxical emboli from deep vein thrombosis via a patent foramen ovale, abruptly blocking distal branches and producing sudden, often multifocal deficits.\n\nHemorrhagic strokes stem from the rupture of weakened cerebral vessel walls, resulting in blood extravasation into brain parenchyma or subarachnoid space. Key causes include saccular aneurysms, which are congenital or acquired dilations at arterial bifurcations prone to rupture under hemodynamic stress, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), characterized by amyloid-beta deposition in small vessel walls that induces fragility and lobar hemorrhages. CAA predominantly affects elderly individuals, with amyloid accumulation disrupting vascular integrity and increasing susceptibility to recurrent bleeds.\n\nHypoperfusion strokes arise from global or regional reductions in cerebral blood flow due to systemic circulatory failure, such as severe hypotension from cardiogenic shock or massive hemorrhage, which impairs perfusion pressure below autoregulatory thresholds. This watershed infarction pattern typically affects border zones between major arterial territories, leading to symmetric deficits. Recent 2025 studies highlight rare genetic etiologies like CADASIL, caused by NOTCH3 gene mutations on chromosome 19, which promote granular osmiophilic material accumulation in vessel walls, resulting in recurrent ischemic strokes and white matter changes from age 30-50 onward. These mechanisms can be exacerbated by risk factors like hypertension, detailed elsewhere.\n\n### Modifiable Risk Factors\n\nModifiable risk factors for stroke encompass behavioral and medical conditions that individuals can address through lifestyle changes or treatment to substantially lower their risk of both ischemic and hemorrhagic events. These factors contribute to atherosclerosis, hypertension, and endothelial dysfunction, which impair cerebral blood flow and vessel integrity. Addressing them is crucial, as they account for a significant portion of preventable strokes, with evidence showing that interventions can reduce incidence by up to 80% in high-risk populations.\n\n**Hypertension** stands as the most significant modifiable risk factor for stroke, associated with over 50% of ischemic and 70% of hemorrhagic cases due to its role in promoting arterial stiffness and plaque formation. Elevated blood pressure accelerates vascular damage, increasing the likelihood of both ischemic events from thrombosis and hemorrhagic events from vessel rupture. According to the 2025 American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology (ACC) guidelines, the target blood pressure for adults, including those at risk for stroke, is less than 130/80 mm Hg, achieved through lifestyle modifications, medications like ACE inhibitors or diuretics, and regular monitoring to prevent progression.\n\n**Smoking** approximately doubles the risk of stroke by causing endothelial damage, promoting thrombosis, and accelerating atherosclerosis through oxidative stress and inflammation. Tobacco smoke introduces chemicals that impair nitric oxide production, leading to vasoconstriction and reduced cerebral perfusion. Quitting smoking yields rapid benefits, with stroke risk declining significantly within 5 years of cessation, approaching that of never-smokers in some studies, due to vascular repair and reduced platelet aggregation.\n\n**Diabetes mellitus** elevates stroke risk by two to four times, primarily by accelerating atherosclerosis and promoting microvascular disease through chronic hyperglycemia and insulin resistance. It also heightens the propensity for cardioembolic strokes via associated cardiomyopathy. Effective management focuses on glycemic control, with the American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommending an HbA1c target of less than 7% for most adults, attained via dietary adjustments, exercise, metformin, or insulin therapy to mitigate endothelial dysfunction and inflammation.\n\n**Obesity and poor dietary habits** further compound stroke risk, with obesity increasing incidence by 50-100% through mechanisms like chronic inflammation, dyslipidemia, and sleep apnea that exacerbate hypertension. Diets high in salt (sodium \\u003e2,300 mg/day) raise blood pressure and stroke risk by 23%, while excessive saturated fats elevate LDL cholesterol, fostering plaque buildup in cerebral arteries. Weight loss interventions, including 2025 evidence on glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists such as semaglutide, demonstrate a 15% reduction in stroke risk by promoting 5-18% body weight loss and improving metabolic profiles.\n\n**Physical inactivity** independently raises stroke risk by 20-30%, as sedentary behavior contributes to hypertension, obesity, and impaired fibrinolysis. Engaging in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise per week, such as brisk walking or cycling, mitigates this by enhancing endothelial function, reducing inflammation, and improving lipid profiles, with guidelines from the AHA and World Health Organization emphasizing its role in primary prevention.\n\n### Non-Modifiable Risk Factors\n\nNon-modifiable risk factors for stroke encompass inherent characteristics such as age, sex, race or ethnicity, and genetic predispositions that cannot be altered through lifestyle or medical interventions. These factors significantly influence stroke susceptibility and contribute to disparities in incidence and outcomes across populations. Understanding them is crucial for targeted screening and prevention strategies in high-risk groups.\n\nAge is the most potent non-modifiable risk factor for stroke, with the risk approximately doubling every decade after age 55. This exponential increase reflects cumulative vascular damage and reduced physiological reserve over time. One in seven strokes occurs in individuals aged 15-49, though the majority affect older adults. As global populations age, confirmed estimates indicate nearly 12 million new strokes annually as of 2025, with one in four people over age 25 facing a lifetime risk, driven largely by demographic shifts toward older age structures.\n\nSex differences in stroke risk are pronounced, with men experiencing higher age-specific incidence rates, particularly before age 75, but women facing a greater lifetime risk—approximately 1 in 4 for both (slightly higher in women due to longer life expectancy)—due to longer life expectancy. Post-menopause, women encounter elevated risks and worse outcomes, including higher mortality and disability rates, partly attributable to hormonal changes and the interplay of other comorbidities. For example, women account for about 55,000 more strokes annually in the United States than men.\n\nRacial and ethnic disparities further exacerbate stroke risk, with non-Hispanic Black individuals having nearly twice the risk of a first stroke and higher mortality rates compared to White individuals, influenced by a combination of genetic vulnerabilities and socioeconomic factors. Similarly, South Asian populations exhibit elevated stroke incidence, often linked to higher prevalence of traditional risk factors like diabetes and hypertension, compounded by genetic predispositions such as variations in lipid metabolism. Pacific Islanders and other minority groups also face disproportionate burdens, underscoring the need for equity-focused public health approaches.\n\nFamily history and genetic factors play a key role in stroke susceptibility, with individuals having a first-degree relative with stroke facing up to a twofold increased risk. Heritable conditions like sickle cell disease, which predominantly affects Black populations, substantially elevate stroke likelihood—particularly ischemic strokes in children—due to abnormal hemoglobin causing vascular occlusion. Genome-wide association studies have identified specific loci, such as those influencing blood pressure regulation and coagulation, that contribute to familial clustering of stroke events. These genetic elements often interact with age to amplify overall risk, as seen in how advancing age intensifies the impact of hypertension in genetically predisposed individuals. Recent data as of 2025 also highlight emerging non-modifiable risks like prior COVID-19 infection contributing to long-term vascular damage and increased stroke susceptibility in survivors.\n\n## Pathophysiology\n\n### Ischemic Mechanisms\n\nIschemic stroke primarily arises from the sudden occlusion of a cerebral artery, typically by a thrombus or embolus, which interrupts blood flow and initiates a sequential pathophysiological process known as the ischemic cascade. This begins with hypoperfusion, where reduced cerebral blood flow deprives brain tissue of oxygen and glucose, leading to rapid ATP depletion within minutes. The energy failure impairs the sodium-potassium-ATPase pump, causing ionic imbalances, cell swelling, and acidosis, which further exacerbate tissue damage.\n\nAs ATP levels drop, neurons release excessive glutamate, triggering excitotoxicity through overactivation of NMDA and AMPA receptors, resulting in massive calcium influx. This calcium overload activates destructive enzymes such as proteases, lipases, and endonucleases, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Ultimately, the cascade culminates in cell death: necrosis predominates in the severely ischemic core due to immediate energy collapse and membrane rupture, while apoptosis occurs in marginally affected regions via caspase activation and programmed pathways. These mechanisms highlight the time-sensitive nature of ischemic injury, where early intervention can interrupt the progression.\n\nCentral to ischemic stroke pathophysiology is the concept of the ischemic penumbra, defined as the viable but at-risk brain tissue surrounding the irreversibly damaged infarct core. Unlike the core, where necrosis occurs rapidly, the penumbra maintains some residual perfusion and ATP levels, rendering it potentially salvageable if blood flow is restored promptly. Advanced imaging, such as perfusion CT or MRI, identifies this mismatch between infarct core and penumbral tissue, guiding therapeutic decisions.\n\nThe therapeutic time window for penumbral salvage extends beyond the traditional 4.5-hour limit for intravenous thrombolysis, reaching up to 24 hours in select patients with favorable imaging profiles. For instance, the DEFUSE 3 trial demonstrated that endovascular thrombectomy in patients 6–16 hours post-onset, with evidence of salvageable penumbra, significantly improved functional outcomes compared to medical management alone. This extended window underscores the penumbra's role in prolonging opportunities for reperfusion therapies, though individual variability in collateral flow influences outcomes.\n\nCollateral circulation, particularly through leptomeningeal anastomoses, plays a critical role in mitigating ischemic damage by providing retrograde blood flow to hypoperfused areas. These pial vessels, connecting distal branches of major cerebral arteries like the anterior, middle, and posterior cerebral arteries, activate during occlusion to redistribute blood and sustain penumbral viability. Robust collaterals can significantly reduce infarct volume and extend the therapeutic window, as they maintain regional cerebral blood flow above critical thresholds.\n\nThe presence and efficiency of leptomeningeal collaterals vary based on factors such as age, genetics, and pre-existing vascular health, with angiographic grading (e.g., American Society of Interventional and Therapeutic Neuroradiology scale) predicting clinical outcomes. Patients with good collaterals exhibit smaller infarcts, lower National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores at presentation, and higher rates of recanalization following thrombolysis or thrombectomy. Enhancing collateral flow, such as through remote ischemic conditioning, has shown promise in preclinical models for further neuroprotection.\n\nWhile reperfusion therapies aim to restore blood flow, they can paradoxically induce reperfusion injury, characterized by oxidative stress upon reoxygenation. This involves a burst of ROS and reactive nitrogen species from activated neutrophils, dysfunctional mitochondria, and xanthine oxidase, leading to lipid peroxidation, protein nitration, and endothelial damage. Nitric oxide reacts with superoxide to form peroxynitrite, amplifying inflammation and blood-brain barrier disruption, which can convert salvageable penumbra into infarcted tissue.\n\nRecent research as of 2025 has advanced neuroprotective agents targeting reperfusion-induced oxidative stress. For example, edaravone dexborneol, a combination antioxidant, has demonstrated efficacy in phase III trials by activating the Nrf2/HO-1/GPX4 pathway to reduce ferroptosis and ROS accumulation, improving neurological scores in ischemia-reperfusion models. Similarly, gastrodin has been shown to attenuate oxidative damage and inflammation via modulation of NF-κB pathways, offering adjunctive benefits when combined with reperfusion therapies. These agents highlight emerging strategies to counteract reperfusion paradoxes, though clinical translation remains ongoing.\n\n### Hemorrhagic Mechanisms\n\nHemorrhagic stroke occurs when a cerebral blood vessel ruptures, leading to bleeding into the brain parenchyma or surrounding spaces, which disrupts normal brain function through direct mechanical and biochemical effects. This rupture often stems from underlying vascular weaknesses such as hypertension-induced arteriolopathy or amyloid angiopathy, resulting in the formation of a hematoma that exerts a mass effect on adjacent brain tissue. The expanding hematoma compresses vital structures, elevating intracranial pressure (ICP) and potentially causing cerebral herniation, a life-threatening shift of brain tissue that impairs blood flow and oxygenation.\n\nThe mass effect from the hematoma not only causes immediate tissue displacement but also contributes to secondary complications by increasing local pressure and disrupting the blood-brain barrier, which can lead to further vascular compromise. In severe cases, this pressure buildup reduces cerebral perfusion pressure, exacerbating neuronal damage beyond the initial bleed site. Unlike ischemic events, where a penumbra of salvageable tissue may exist, hemorrhagic strokes primarily inflict damage through the physical expansion of the hematoma rather than oxygen deprivation alone.\n\nFollowing the initial rupture, secondary injury mechanisms amplify tissue damage as blood components degrade within the brain. Erythrocytes lyse, releasing hemoglobin and its breakdown products, including heme and iron, which trigger oxidative stress, inflammation, and perihematomal edema. Iron, in particular, catalyzes free radical formation, promoting ferroptosis and necroptosis—iron-dependent cell death pathways that worsen neuronal loss and edema formation around the hematoma. This inflammatory cascade involves microglial activation and cytokine release, further expanding the zone of injury and contributing to long-term neurological deficits.\n\nCoagulation disruptions play a critical role in hematoma progression, often through an imbalance favoring fibrinolysis over clot stabilization. The release of tissue plasminogen activator from perihematomal cells promotes premature fibrinolysis, leading to clot instability and subsequent hematoma expansion in up to 38% of cases. This expansion is multifactorial, involving local pressure gradients and protease activity that degrade the fibrin matrix, allowing further bleeding from fragile vessels. Anticoagulant use or underlying coagulopathies exacerbate this process by impairing hemostasis, increasing the risk of early neurological deterioration.\n\nRecent research as of 2025 highlights the role of cerebral microbleeds (CMBs)—small, subclinical hemorrhages visible on MRI—in the progression to larger intracerebral hemorrhages. CMBs, often linked to small vessel disease, indicate chronic vascular fragility and are associated with increased inflammation and blood-brain barrier leakage, predisposing individuals to symptomatic hemorrhage expansion. Studies show that higher CMB burdens predict recurrent small vessel events and correlate with worse outcomes in acute hemorrhage, emphasizing their utility as imaging biomarkers for risk stratification. Accumulating evidence from 2024-2025 cohorts suggests that addressing modifiable factors like hypertension may mitigate CMB progression and reduce the likelihood of macrohemorrhages.\n\n## Diagnosis\n\n### Physical Examination\n\nThe physical examination in suspected stroke begins with an assessment of vital signs to identify immediate threats and potential underlying causes. Blood pressure is frequently elevated in acute stroke due to cerebral autoregulation or stress responses, with systolic pressures often exceeding 180 mmHg requiring careful monitoring to avoid exacerbating ischemia or hemorrhage. Blood glucose level is also measured via fingerstick to exclude hypoglycemia as a stroke mimic. Pulse assessment may reveal irregularities suggestive of atrial fibrillation, a common cardioembolic source, occurring in up to 20-30% of ischemic strokes. Temperature, oxygen saturation, and respiratory rate are also evaluated to rule out concurrent infections or hypoxia that could mimic or complicate stroke symptoms.\n\nA core component of the bedside evaluation is the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), a standardized 15-item tool scoring stroke severity from 0 (normal) to 42 (severe deficits), widely used to guide triage and prognosis. It evaluates key domains including level of consciousness (assessed via alertness and responsiveness, scored 0-3), motor function (arm and leg drift or paralysis, scored 0-4 per limb), and other elements like facial palsy and sensory loss. Higher scores correlate with larger infarct volumes and worse outcomes, with scores above 16 indicating severe stroke warranting urgent intervention.\n\nThe comprehensive neurological examination focuses on focal deficits to localize the lesion. Cranial nerve testing reveals asymmetries such as horizontal gaze deviation toward the lesion in hemispheric strokes or facial weakness (central versus peripheral patterns). Motor examination assesses tone, strength, and coordination, often showing hemiparesis or hemiplegia contralateral to the lesion. Sensory testing identifies hemisensory loss, while reflexes may demonstrate hyperreflexia and a positive Babinski sign—an upward great toe response with fanning—indicating upper motor neuron involvement typical in corticospinal tract disruption from stroke.\n\nAccording to American Heart Association/American Stroke Association guidelines, physical examination can integrate with tele-stroke systems for remote assessment in underserved areas, enabling real-time NIHSS administration via audiovisual consultation to expedite thrombolysis decisions. This approach, supported by the American Telemedicine Association, ensures standardized evaluation without delaying confirmatory imaging.\n\n### Imaging Modalities\n\nComputed tomography (CT) scanning serves as the first-line imaging modality in the acute evaluation of suspected stroke, primarily to detect intracranial hemorrhage and differentiate it from ischemic events. Non-contrast CT is particularly valued for its rapid acquisition, widespread availability, and high sensitivity in identifying hyperdense areas indicative of acute hemorrhage, which appear as bright regions against the surrounding brain tissue. This modality effectively rules out contraindications to thrombolytic therapy, such as bleeding, with guidelines recommending its use within minutes of patient arrival to facilitate timely intervention.\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides superior sensitivity for detecting early ischemic changes compared to CT, making it essential for confirming infarction in non-hemorrhagic cases. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) sequences are highly effective at identifying cytotoxic edema within minutes of ischemia onset, appearing as hyperintense areas that correspond to restricted water diffusion in affected tissue. Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) complements DWI by suppressing cerebrospinal fluid signals to better visualize subacute or chronic lesions, such as gliosis or old infarcts, and helps assess the timing of stroke through DWI-FLAIR mismatch, where DWI positivity without FLAIR changes indicates an acute event within 4.5 hours.\n\nCT and MR angiography enable detailed visualization of vascular occlusions, guiding decisions for endovascular therapies. CT angiography (CTA) rapidly assesses large vessel patency by injecting iodinated contrast to highlight blockages, such as in the middle cerebral artery, with high accuracy for identifying candidates for thrombectomy. Similarly, MR angiography (MRA) offers non-invasive vessel imaging without radiation, though it is less commonly used acutely due to longer scan times. Perfusion imaging, available via CT or MR, maps cerebral blood flow to delineate the ischemic penumbra—the viable but hypoperfused tissue surrounding the infarct core—using parameters like cerebral blood volume and mean transit time to quantify salvageable brain regions.\n\nBy 2025, artificial intelligence (AI) enhancements have significantly accelerated stroke imaging interpretation, integrating automated detection of hemorrhages, vessel occlusions, and perfusion mismatches to streamline workflows. AI tools, such as those from Viz.ai and RapidAI, analyze non-contrast CT and perfusion scans in real-time, alerting clinicians to abnormalities and reducing door-to-needle times for thrombolysis from averages of 44 minutes to as low as 42 minutes in equipped centers. These systems improve diagnostic accuracy for large vessel occlusions by up to 90% while minimizing human error, particularly in high-volume settings, thereby expanding access to time-sensitive treatments.\n\n### Identifying Underlying Causes\n\nIdentifying the underlying cause of a stroke is essential for guiding secondary prevention strategies and reducing the risk of recurrence. After initial diagnosis, a comprehensive etiological evaluation targets potential cardioembolic, atherothrombotic, and other sources, particularly in cases of ischemic stroke or cryptogenic events. This process involves targeted cardiac, vascular, and laboratory assessments to classify the stroke subtype according to frameworks like the TOAST criteria, enabling tailored therapies such as anticoagulation or antiplatelet agents.\n\n**Cardiac evaluation** begins with an electrocardiogram (ECG) to detect atrial fibrillation (AFib) and other arrhythmias, identifying AFib in approximately 7.7% of patients (95% CI, 5.0–10.8). Transthoracic echocardiography is recommended to identify structural abnormalities like left ventricular thrombus or valvular disease, with transesophageal echocardiography preferred for detecting atrial thrombi or tumors, potentially altering management in about 1 in 7 patients with embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS). For paroxysmal AFib, which may be missed on standard ECG, prolonged monitoring with Holter devices or insertable cardiac monitors is advised, detecting occult AFib in up to 16.1% of cryptogenic cases over 30 days compared to 3.2% with routine care (95% CI, 8.0–17.6; P\\u003c0.001).\n\n**Vascular studies** focus on assessing extracranial and intracranial arteries for atherosclerosis or dissection. Noninvasive carotid ultrasound with Doppler is routinely recommended to evaluate for stenosis, offering 38.8% sensitivity and 91.6% specificity for ≥70% carotid stenosis, which informs decisions on carotid endarterectomy or stenting in symptomatic patients. This modality is particularly useful in identifying large-artery atherosclerosis as the stroke mechanism, especially when combined with clinical features like cortical infarcts greater than 1.5 cm.\n\n**Blood tests** provide insights into coagulopathy, metabolic risks, and rare inherited disorders. A coagulation profile, including prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and international normalized ratio, screens for hypercoagulable states or bleeding risks, with further thrombophilia testing (e.g., protein C/S, antithrombin) considered in younger patients without evident causes, ideally delayed 4-6 weeks post-event. Lipid profiling assesses dyslipidemia, targeting low-density lipoprotein cholesterol below 70 mg/dL in atherosclerotic cases, while hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) detects undiagnosed diabetes in about 11.5% of stroke patients. For rare monogenic causes like Fabry disease or cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), genetic testing is recommended in young adults with cryptogenic stroke or family history, identifying actionable variants in up to 7% of selected cases.\n\nAs of 2025, extended monitoring with wearable devices has emerged as a practical advancement for detecting paroxysmal AFib in stroke survivors. Devices like wireless patch ECG systems (e.g., Duranta) enable continuous 7-day monitoring, identifying new AFib in 8.7% of ischemic stroke patients without prior diagnosis (95% CI, 5.4–12.4), facilitating prompt anticoagulation and reducing recurrence risk with minimal adverse events (0.4% incidence of skin irritation). These tools complement traditional Holter monitoring by offering outpatient convenience and higher compliance in cryptogenic stroke populations.\n\n## Prevention\n\n### Lifestyle Modifications\n\nAdopting healthy lifestyle modifications plays a crucial role in primary prevention of stroke by addressing modifiable risk factors such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, and inflammation. These behavioral changes, when implemented consistently, can substantially lower stroke incidence through improvements in vascular health and overall cardiovascular function. Evidence from large-scale cohort studies and meta-analyses supports targeted interventions in diet, physical activity, smoking cessation, weight management, and alcohol consumption as effective strategies.\n\n**Dietary patterns** like the Mediterranean diet, rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, and olive oil, have been shown to reduce stroke risk by approximately 28-30%. In the PREDIMED trial, participants following a Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil or nuts experienced a 30% (HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.54-0.92) and 28% (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.54-0.96) lower risk of stroke, respectively, compared to a control group advised on low-fat diets. Similarly, the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet, emphasizing fruits, vegetables, low-fat dairy, and reduced saturated fats, is associated with a 14% reduction in ischemic stroke risk (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.78-0.94) for high versus low adherence. Limiting sodium intake to less than 2 g per day further supports stroke prevention by lowering blood pressure; guidelines recommend this reduction, as a 1 g daily decrease in sodium can yield a 20% drop in cardiovascular events, including stroke (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.66-0.97).\n\n**Regular aerobic exercise** lowers blood pressure and enhances endothelial function, contributing to stroke risk reduction. A 2024 systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis indicates that higher levels of leisure-time physical activity are linked to approximately 17% lower stroke risk compared to sedentary behavior (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.79-0.88), with a 9% risk reduction per 20 MET-hours/week increase. For instance, engaging in at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity per week, such as brisk walking or cycling, aligns with these benefits.\n\n**Smoking cessation** provides immediate and long-term vascular benefits, dramatically cutting stroke risk. Within 8 hours of quitting, oxygen levels normalize and carbon monoxide halves, improving circulation; by 5 years, stroke risk equals that of never-smokers. Programs incorporating nicotine replacement therapy, such as patches or gum, double quit rates and are safe for cardiovascular patients, facilitating these rapid improvements without increasing acute events. Smokers face nearly three times the stroke risk, making cessation a high-impact intervention.\n\n**Weight management** targeting a BMI below 25 kg/m² helps control stroke risk by mitigating obesity-related factors like hypertension and diabetes. In middle-aged and elderly men, maintaining BMI under 25.94 kg/m² is associated with a 7.6% lower stroke risk per unit decrease below this threshold (HR 1.076 per 1 kg/m² increase, 95% CI 1.034-1.119). Incorporating sleep hygiene practices, such as aiming for 7-8 hours of quality sleep nightly through consistent routines and a conducive environment, further aids weight control and reduces stroke risk; deviations (≤5 or ≥10 hours) elevate risk by 10-12%.\n\n**Alcohol moderation** is essential, as excessive consumption raises blood pressure and stroke risk. Guidelines recommend limiting intake to no more than 1 standard drink per day for women and 2 for men to minimize risk, with abstinence advised for those with contraindications like liver disease.\n\n### Medical Interventions\n\nMedical interventions for stroke prevention primarily involve pharmacological agents targeting modifiable risk factors such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and thromboembolic conditions, alongside select procedural options for high-risk vascular stenoses. These strategies are guided by evidence from large-scale clinical trials and professional society recommendations, emphasizing individualized risk assessment using tools like the PREVENT calculator to prioritize therapy initiation.\n\nHypertension management remains a cornerstone of stroke prevention, with guidelines recommending a target blood pressure of less than 130/80 mm Hg for all adults, including those at elevated stroke risk. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, such as lisinopril, are first-line agents, particularly for patients with comorbid diabetes or chronic kidney disease, due to their renoprotective effects and demonstrated reduction in recurrent stroke risk by approximately 20-30% in secondary prevention trials. Beta-blockers, like metoprolol, are reserved for specific indications such as post-myocardial infarction or heart failure but are not preferred as monotherapy for isolated hypertension owing to less robust evidence for stroke risk reduction compared to other classes. In 2024 guideline updates, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, including semaglutide, are incorporated into targets for patients with comorbid diabetes and obesity, providing modest systolic blood pressure reductions of 5-8 mm Hg alongside cardiovascular benefits, though they serve as adjuncts rather than primary antihypertensives.\n\nFor hyperlipidemia, statin therapy is recommended to lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels and mitigate atherothrombotic stroke risk. High-intensity statins, such as atorvastatin 40-80 mg daily, are indicated for patients with clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or high 10-year risk (≥7.5%), aiming for an LDL target of less than 70 mg/dL to achieve at least a 50% reduction from baseline, which correlates with a 20-25% relative risk reduction in stroke events based on meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials. This approach is supported for both primary and secondary prevention, with addition of ezetimibe if LDL goals are not met on maximal statin dosing.\n\nAntiplatelet therapy with low-dose aspirin (81 mg daily) is considered for primary stroke prevention in select high-risk groups without elevated bleeding risk, such as adults aged 40-59 years with a 10-year cardiovascular disease risk of 10% or greater, though routine use is not recommended due to net harm from bleeding in broader populations. This selective application stems from trials like ASPREE and ARRIVE, which showed minimal ischemic benefit outweighed by hemorrhage risks in low-risk individuals.\n\nDirect oral anticoagulants (DOACs), including apixaban and rivaroxaban, are the preferred agents for stroke prevention in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, offering superior efficacy and safety over vitamin K antagonists like warfarin, with a 19% relative risk reduction in stroke or systemic embolism and lower intracranial hemorrhage rates in pivotal trials such as ARISTOTLE and ROCKET AF. Dosing is adjusted based on renal function and CHA2DS2-VASc score, with initiation recommended for scores ≥2 in men or ≥3 in women. For carotid artery stenosis exceeding 70%, carotid endarterectomy is indicated in symptomatic patients to reduce ipsilateral stroke risk by 65% over two years, as evidenced by the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET), with procedural benefits persisting in contemporary analyses.\n\nLifestyle modifications, such as the DASH diet, can enhance the efficacy of these interventions by further lowering blood pressure and LDL levels when combined with pharmacotherapy.\n\n### Special Populations\n\nPrevention strategies for stroke must be tailored to special populations with unique risk profiles. In women, hormonal factors significantly influence stroke risk. Combined oral contraceptives (COCs), particularly those with high estrogen doses (≥50 μg), are associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke, though the absolute risk remains low for most low-risk women and is generally lower than the stroke risk during pregnancy. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT), especially oral estrogen plus progestin or estrogen alone in postmenopausal women, also elevates the risk of ischemic stroke, with clinical trials indicating a heightened incidence during use. Pregnancy-related strokes, including those from preeclampsia or peripartum cardiomyopathy, represent a critical period of vulnerability, necessitating preconception counseling and close monitoring of blood pressure and clotting factors in at-risk women.\n\nFor individuals with a previous transient ischemic attack (TIA) or minor ischemic stroke, secondary prevention focuses on intensified antithrombotic regimens. The American Heart Association/American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) guidelines recommend dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and clopidogrel for 21 days in patients with high-risk TIA or minor noncardioembolic stroke, followed by monotherapy to reduce recurrent events, as longer-term DAPT beyond 90 days is not advised due to bleeding risks. This approach has demonstrated a reduction in stroke recurrence at 90 days compared to aspirin alone when initiated within 72 hours of symptom onset.\n\nEthnic disparities in stroke burden require targeted screening and interventions in high-risk groups. African Americans and Hispanics face a higher incidence of stroke, driven by greater prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, and socioeconomic barriers to care, with Black individuals experiencing nearly double the stroke mortality rate compared to Whites. The American Heart Association's 2023 scientific statement emphasizes community-based screening programs and culturally tailored education to address these inequities, including mobile clinics for blood pressure monitoring in underserved ethnic communities. Such initiatives aim to improve early detection and risk factor control in populations with disproportionate stroke rates.\n\nIn children and young adults, stroke prevention prioritizes non-modifiable and rare etiologies distinct from adult profiles. Genetic screening is crucial for identifying hereditary conditions like sickle cell disease, moyamoya syndrome, or thrombophilias, which account for up to 20% of pediatric arterial ischemic strokes, enabling family counseling and targeted therapies such as anticoagulation or surgery. Trauma prevention is equally vital, as head or neck injuries from accidents or sports are independent risk factors for childhood stroke, with population-based strategies recommending helmet use, seatbelt enforcement, and avoidance of high-risk activities to mitigate cervical artery dissection. Acute infections should also be promptly managed, as they independently elevate stroke risk in this age group.\n\n## Management\n\n### Acute Ischemic Stroke\n\nAcute ischemic stroke, characterized by sudden occlusion of a cerebral artery leading to brain tissue ischemia, requires urgent interventions aimed at restoring cerebral blood flow to minimize neuronal damage and improve outcomes. The primary treatments focus on reperfusion therapies, including intravenous thrombolysis and endovascular thrombectomy, alongside supportive measures such as blood pressure control and early antiplatelet administration. These approaches are time-sensitive, with efficacy diminishing rapidly after symptom onset, emphasizing the need for rapid diagnosis and triage in specialized stroke centers.\n\nIntravenous thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA), specifically alteplase, is the cornerstone of acute reperfusion therapy for eligible patients presenting within 4.5 hours of symptom onset. Administered at a dose of 0.9 mg/kg (maximum 90 mg), with 10% as a bolus followed by infusion over 60 minutes, alteplase dissolves fibrin in the occluding thrombus to recanalize the vessel. Clinical trials such as the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) study demonstrated a 30% increased likelihood of minimal or no disability at 3 months with this treatment, though it carries a 6% risk of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. Eligibility requires a clinical diagnosis of ischemic stroke with measurable neurologic deficit, confirmed absence of hemorrhage on non-contrast CT, and adherence to age and time criteria; extended use up to 9 hours may apply in select cases with advanced imaging showing salvageable tissue.\n\nTenecteplase, a genetically engineered mutant of tPA, is an alternative thrombolytic agent approved by the FDA in March 2025 for acute ischemic stroke. Administered as a single intravenous bolus of 0.25 mg/kg (maximum 25 mg) within 4.5 hours of symptom onset, it offers simpler administration and potentially faster recanalization compared to alteplase. Multiple 2025 randomized trials and meta-analyses, including comparisons in patients with large vessel occlusion, have demonstrated non-inferiority to alteplase for achieving excellent functional outcomes (modified Rankin Scale 0-1 at 90 days), with similar safety profiles regarding symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, and signals of superiority in neurological improvement for more severe strokes. Eligibility criteria are generally similar to those for alteplase, with ongoing guidelines evaluating its role in extended time windows and combination with thrombectomy.\n\nExclusion criteria for alteplase are stringent to mitigate bleeding risks and include active internal bleeding, recent intracranial or intraspinal surgery within 3 months, severe uncontrolled hypertension (systolic \\u003e185 mmHg or diastolic \\u003e110 mmHg despite treatment), known intracranial neoplasm or arteriovenous malformation, and recent major trauma or gastrointestinal/genitourinary hemorrhage within 21 days. Additional relative exclusions encompass platelet count \\u003c100,000/mm³, anticoagulant use with elevated INR \\u003e1.7 or PT \\u003e15 seconds, or current use of direct oral anticoagulants without reversal. For patients aged \\u003e80 years, severe stroke (NIHSS \\u003e25), oral anticoagulant use, or history of diabetes and prior stroke, treatment between 3-4.5 hours is considered only if benefits outweigh risks, as supported by the European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study III (ECASS III) trial. These criteria ensure safer application, with overall guidelines recommending treatment in approximately 10-15% of acute ischemic stroke presentations.\n\nEndovascular thrombectomy represents a highly effective mechanical reperfusion strategy for patients with large vessel occlusion (LVO), involving catheter-based retrieval of the clot to achieve recanalization. Indicated for anterior circulation LVO (e.g., internal carotid or middle cerebral artery) in patients up to 6 hours from onset based on trials like MR CLEAN, ESCAPE, and EXTEND-IA, which showed improved 90-day functional independence (modified Rankin Scale 0-2) in 46-71% of treated patients versus 17-30% with medical management alone. For later presentations (6-24 hours), thrombectomy is recommended in select cases with favorable imaging profiles, such as small infarct core and mismatch between core and penumbra on CT or MRI perfusion, as established by the DAWN and DEFUSE 3 trials, which reported absolute risk reductions of 20-30% in disability. Devices like stent retrievers (e.g., Solitaire) or aspiration catheters (e.g., Penumbra) are used, often following or in combination with IV thrombolysis when feasible.\n\nRecent advancements extend thrombectomy benefits to posterior circulation strokes, particularly basilar artery occlusion, where recent trials such as the BASICS (2020) and ATTENTION (2022), along with updated guidelines, support intervention up to 24 hours in eligible patients with LVO and salvageable tissue. These trials demonstrated superior outcomes with thrombectomy over medical therapy alone, achieving successful reperfusion in 80-90% of cases and reducing mortality by 20-30%, prompting European Stroke Organisation (ESO) and American Heart Association (AHA) endorsements for routine use in this high-mortality subgroup (up to 80% untreated). Selection relies on multimodal imaging to identify patients with moderate-to-severe deficits (NIHSS ≥6 or posterior circulation-specific scores) and limited baseline infarction.\n\nBlood pressure management in acute ischemic stroke adopts a permissive hypertension approach to maintain cerebral perfusion in the ischemic penumbra, targeting \\u003c220/120 mmHg in untreated patients without reperfusion therapy. However, prior to thrombolysis, hypertension must be controlled to \\u003c185/110 mmHg to reduce hemorrhage risk, using short-acting agents like labetalol (10-20 mg IV) or nicardipine infusion (5-15 mg/h) if needed. Post-thrombolysis or thrombectomy, the target shifts to \\u003c180/105 mmHg for the first 24 hours, after which permissive levels resume unless comorbid conditions (e.g., myocardial ischemia) necessitate tighter control. This strategy, derived from observational data and randomized trials like INTERACT2, balances autoregulation preservation with reperfusion safety, avoiding aggressive lowering that could exacerbate ischemia.\n\nAntiplatelet therapy with aspirin (160-325 mg orally or rectally) is initiated within 24-48 hours of stroke onset in non-thrombolyzed patients to prevent early recurrent ischemic events, reducing 14-day risk by 12% as shown in the International Stroke Trial (IST). For those receiving IV alteplase, aspirin is deferred for at least 24 hours post-treatment, pending follow-up imaging to exclude hemorrhage, per AHA/ASA recommendations. Dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin plus clopidogrel) may be considered for 21 days in minor stroke or high-risk TIA, based on the POINT and CHANCE trials, which reported 30-32% relative risk reductions in recurrent stroke without significant bleeding excess. Long-term secondary prevention follows separate guidelines.\n\n### Acute Hemorrhagic Stroke\n\nAcute hemorrhagic stroke, primarily intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) or subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), demands immediate interventions to halt bleeding expansion, mitigate intracranial pressure (ICP), and prevent secondary brain injury. Unlike ischemic stroke, where restoring blood flow within specific time windows is paramount, hemorrhagic stroke prioritizes rapid hemostasis to limit hematoma growth and associated mass effect. Management begins with stabilizing vital signs, securing airway if needed, and transferring to a specialized neurointensive care unit for continuous monitoring.\n\nBlood pressure management is a cornerstone of acute therapy, as hypertension exacerbates hematoma expansion. Current guidelines recommend lowering systolic blood pressure to a target of less than 140 mmHg in patients with mild to moderate ICH to reduce bleeding risk without compromising cerebral perfusion. Intravenous agents such as nicardipine or labetalol are preferred for their titratable effects and ability to achieve smooth reduction while minimizing variability. This approach, supported by randomized trials like INTERACT2 and ATACH-2, has shown a modest reduction in hematoma growth and improved functional outcomes when initiated within hours of symptom onset.\n\nFor patients on anticoagulation, prompt reversal is critical to restore hemostasis and limit hematoma progression. In warfarin-associated ICH, prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) is administered to rapidly normalize the international normalized ratio (INR), typically achieving correction within minutes. For direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), idarucizumab serves as the specific reversal agent for dabigatran, binding and neutralizing it effectively. For factor Xa inhibitors like rivaroxaban or apixaban, andexanet alfa is the recommended antidote, with 2025 studies and meta-analyses demonstrating its efficacy in reducing hematoma expansion and potential mortality benefits compared to alternatives like PCC, including fixed dosing regimens for improved accessibility in emergency settings.\n\nSurgical interventions are reserved for select cases to evacuate hematoma and relieve pressure. Craniotomy with open hematoma evacuation is indicated for patients with deteriorating neurological status, particularly those with cerebellar hemorrhages greater than 3 cm or brainstem compression, where it can prevent herniation. Minimally invasive techniques, such as stereotactic aspiration, may be considered for supratentorial ICH in stable patients, but evidence from trials like STICH II supports surgery primarily in those with significant midline shift or clinical decline. Outcomes improve when surgery occurs within 24-48 hours, though overall mortality remains high.\n\nVentriculostomy via external ventricular drain (EVD) placement is essential for managing acute hydrocephalus caused by intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), which obstructs cerebrospinal fluid pathways and elevates ICP. This procedure allows continuous drainage of blood-tinged CSF, reducing ICP and facilitating ICP monitoring, with guidelines recommending it for patients with Glasgow Coma Scale scores below 13 or radiographic evidence of ventricular dilation. Complications like infection occur in up to 10% of cases, but EVD combined with intraventricular thrombolysis has been associated with lower mortality in severe IVH.\n\n### Supportive and Hospital Care\n\nSupportive care during acute hospitalization for stroke patients focuses on stabilizing vital functions, preventing secondary complications, and optimizing recovery potential through structured, multidisciplinary interventions. This approach emphasizes close monitoring in specialized environments to address common post-stroke risks such as neurological deterioration, infections, and metabolic imbalances.\n\nStroke units provide organized, multidisciplinary care involving neurologists, nurses, therapists, and pharmacists, which has been shown to reduce mortality by approximately 20% compared to general wards. These units enable continuous monitoring for complications, including aspiration, through protocols that integrate vital sign surveillance, neurological assessments, and early intervention for issues like elevated intracranial pressure or seizures. In addition to supportive measures, stroke units facilitate rapid administration of subtype-specific treatments, such as thrombolysis for ischemic stroke.\n\nSwallowing assessment is a critical early component of supportive care, typically performed within four hours of hospital arrival using standardized screening tools to identify dysphagia and prevent aspiration pneumonia, a leading cause of morbidity in stroke patients. If swallowing is impaired, nasogastric (NG) tube feeding is initiated promptly to ensure nutritional support and reduce the risk of dehydration or malnutrition while avoiding oral intake.\n\nGlycemic control is essential in the acute phase, with insulin therapy recommended for patients exhibiting hyperglycemia above 180 mg/dL to mitigate risks of worse neurological outcomes and increased infection rates. This involves frequent blood glucose monitoring and intravenous insulin infusion titrated to maintain levels between 140 and 180 mg/dL, balancing the avoidance of both hypo- and hyperglycemia.\n\nAs of late 2025, following the expiration of broader Medicare telehealth flexibilities on September 30, 2025, stroke care protocols continue to support telemedicine integration, particularly for rural access, enabling remote specialist consultations via telestroke networks to expedite diagnosis and supportive management in underserved areas. These protocols emphasize real-time video assessments and data sharing to support timely transfers or interventions, reducing disparities in care quality.\n\n## Rehabilitation\n\n### Physical and Occupational Therapy\n\nPhysical and occupational therapy play crucial roles in stroke rehabilitation by targeting motor recovery and functional independence, focusing on restoring movement, balance, and the ability to perform everyday activities. These therapies are typically initiated early in the recovery process, often within days of the acute phase, and are tailored to the individual's deficits, such as hemiparesis or impaired coordination. Evidence from systematic reviews indicates that intensive, repetitive practice in these domains leads to measurable improvements in mobility and self-care, with gains persisting for months post-intervention when combined with multidisciplinary care.\n\nConstraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) is a specialized physical therapy approach designed to enhance upper limb recovery after stroke by promoting intensive use of the affected arm. In CIMT, the unaffected arm is restrained—often with a mitt or sling—for several hours daily, forcing patients to perform repetitive, task-oriented exercises with the paretic limb to overcome learned non-use. This method, derived from neuroplasticity principles, involves massed practice of functional movements like grasping objects or reaching, typically over 2-6 weeks. Clinical trials have demonstrated that CIMT significantly improves motor function and daily arm use in patients with mild to moderate upper extremity impairments, with effects lasting up to a year. Modified versions of CIMT, adapted for acute and subacute stages, further enhance upper limb strength and dexterity without increasing fatigue.\n\nGait training forms a cornerstone of physical therapy for lower limb recovery, aiming to restore walking ability and reduce fall risk in stroke survivors. Techniques often include treadmill training with partial body-weight support, where a harness unloads the patient's weight to facilitate stepping patterns without full postural demands, allowing for higher repetition of gait cycles. Robotic-assisted systems, such as the Lokomat, provide guided leg movements on a treadmill, simulating natural walking kinematics while adjusting for patient progress. These interventions improve walking speed, endurance, and balance, with studies showing outcomes comparable to or better than conventional therapy, particularly for those with severe impairments. Lokomat training, for instance, enables prolonged sessions at physiological speeds, promoting neural reorganization and functional gait recovery.\n\nOccupational therapy emphasizes retraining for activities of daily living (ADLs) to foster independence in self-care and household tasks post-stroke. Therapists guide patients through simulated or real-life practice of skills like dressing, using utensils, or preparing simple meals, adapting environments with tools such as reachers or one-handed cutting boards. This client-centered approach builds fine motor skills, sequencing, and problem-solving for instrumental ADLs like cooking, often integrating sensory re-education to address neglect or apraxia. Research supports that occupation-based interventions significantly boost ADL performance and social participation, with patients gaining confidence in home management.\n\nRecent evidence from 2025 underscores the efficacy of task-specific training in these therapies, with task-oriented approaches like circuit training improving functional independence in a substantial proportion of stroke patients. For example, guidelines highlight that repetitive, goal-directed practice in physical and occupational sessions enhances motor performance and ADL autonomy, often achieving clinically meaningful gains in over half of participants when delivered intensively. These methods may briefly overlap with cognitive demands, such as sustained attention during complex tasks, but prioritize physical execution.\n\n### Speech and Cognitive Therapy\n\nSpeech and cognitive therapy plays a crucial role in stroke rehabilitation, targeting impairments in language, memory, attention, executive function, and spatial awareness that affect up to 70% of survivors. These interventions, often delivered by speech-language pathologists, neuropsychologists, and occupational therapists, aim to restore or compensate for deficits through structured exercises and compensatory strategies, improving quality of life and independence. Early initiation, ideally within the first few weeks post-stroke, has been shown to enhance outcomes, with multidisciplinary approaches integrating these therapies into comprehensive care plans.\n\nSpeech-language pathology focuses on addressing aphasia, a common language disorder affecting comprehension, expression, and reading in approximately 25-40% of stroke patients, particularly those with left-hemisphere damage. Melodic intonation therapy (MIT), a seminal technique developed in the 1970s and refined through subsequent studies, leverages the preserved musical abilities in the right hemisphere to facilitate speech production; it involves singing simple phrases with hand-tapping rhythms to build verbal fluency. Clinical trials have demonstrated MIT's efficacy in improving naming and sentence production, with gains persisting up to six months post-treatment in non-fluent aphasia cases.\n\nCognitive rehabilitation employs targeted programs to mitigate deficits in memory, attention, and problem-solving, which occur in over 50% of stroke survivors and contribute to functional limitations. Computer-based interventions, such as those using software like RehaCom or CogniFit, deliver adaptive exercises that train divided attention and working memory through gamified tasks, with sessions typically lasting 30-60 minutes several times weekly. A 2025 meta-analysis of 19 randomized controlled trials involving 875 participants found these programs significantly improved attention (SMD=0.45) and general cognitive function compared to standard care, with a moderate effect on memory (SMD=0.42), though benefits are more pronounced in mild-to-moderate impairments and when combined with real-world application.\n\nPsychological support is integral to addressing post-stroke depression and anxiety, which affect about 30% of patients and exacerbate cognitive decline if untreated. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) adapted for stroke survivors, often in group or individual formats, helps reframe negative thought patterns and build coping skills, with evidence from systematic reviews showing a 20-30% reduction in depressive symptoms after 8-12 sessions. These interventions also incorporate mindfulness techniques to manage anxiety related to cognitive changes.\n\nMirror therapy addresses visuospatial neglect syndromes, prevalent in 20-30% of right-hemisphere stroke cases, where patients ignore one side of space despite intact vision. By placing a mirror in the midsagittal plane to reflect the unaffected limb, this non-invasive method creates an illusion of bilateral movement, promoting awareness and attention to the neglected side through visual feedback during simple gestures. Randomized studies report significant improvements in neglect scores on standardized tests like the Behavioral Inattention Test after 4-6 weeks of daily 30-minute sessions. In some protocols, brief integration with physical therapy enhances overall spatial reintegration without shifting focus to motor recovery.\n\n### Emerging Rehabilitation Techniques\n\nEmerging rehabilitation techniques for stroke leverage advanced technologies and biological interventions to promote neural recovery and functional restoration beyond traditional therapies. These approaches aim to harness brain plasticity, repair damaged neural tissue, or facilitate motor control through innovative interfaces, often showing promising results in clinical trials.\n\nBrain-computer interfaces (BCIs) represent a cutting-edge method for addressing post-stroke paralysis, particularly in restoring upper limb function. These systems utilize electroencephalography (EEG) to detect and interpret brain signals, enabling patients to control external devices such as robotic prosthetics or exoskeletons without physical movement. A 2025 systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials demonstrated that BCI-based interventions significantly improved motor recovery in stroke survivors, with moderate effect sizes on upper extremity function as measured by the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA-UE) scale, where participants showed gains of 5-10 points on average after 20-30 sessions. Recent trials in 2025, including multimodal assessments combining EEG with functional near-infrared spectroscopy, further confirmed motor gains, with improvements in cortical activation patterns and daily living activities, attributing these to enhanced neuroplasticity in the affected hemisphere.\n\nStem cell therapy offers an experimental avenue for neural repair by transplanting cells to regenerate damaged brain tissue following ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke. This approach involves administering mesenchymal or neural stem cells intravenously or directly into the lesion site to modulate inflammation, promote angiogenesis, and differentiate into neural lineages. Phase II clinical trials in 2024, such as the randomized evaluation of allogeneic MultiStem cells, reported safety with no significant adverse events compared to placebo, though efficacy varied; the TREASURE trial showed no significant superiority in functional outcomes, with similar proportions achieving excellent recovery on combined measures (mRS ≤1, NIHSS ≤1, Barthel Index ≥95) at 90 days (11.5% treated vs. 9.8% control). A 2025 meta-analysis corroborated these findings, indicating that bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells improved neurological scores in subacute stroke phases, with neural repair mechanisms including paracrine effects that enhance endogenous plasticity.\n\nVirtual reality (VR) systems provide immersive environments for gait training, targeting balance and mobility deficits that contribute to fall risk after stroke. By simulating real-world scenarios on treadmills or in free-standing setups, VR encourages repetitive, task-specific practice that boosts engagement and neuroplasticity in the motor cortex. A 2025 randomized controlled trial of VR-based treadmill training in chronic stroke patients reported significant reductions in fall risk, as assessed by the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test (mean improvement of 3-5 seconds) and Berg Balance Scale (gains of 4-6 points), alongside enhanced gait symmetry and speed. Meta-analyses from the same year support these outcomes, showing VR interventions decrease fall incidence by 20-30% over 12 weeks, attributed to improved proprioceptive feedback and cortical reorganization.\n\nNon-invasive brain stimulation techniques, such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), modulate cortical excitability to augment plasticity during rehabilitation. tDCS applies low-intensity currents via scalp electrodes to the primary motor cortex, facilitating synaptic strengthening in the ipsilesional hemisphere while suppressing contralesional overactivity. A 2025 study on dual-target tDCS combined with motor training demonstrated enhanced neuroplasticity, with EEG measures showing increased event-related desynchronization in the beta band and functional improvements in hand dexterity (FMA-UE gains of 7 points post-10 sessions). Recent reviews highlight tDCS's role in stroke recovery, noting its ability to boost long-term potentiation-like effects, leading to better motor outcomes in 60-70% of participants across phase II trials.\n\n## Prognosis\n\n### Immediate Outcomes\n\nThe immediate outcomes following a stroke are characterized by high short-term mortality and variable functional recovery, influenced by stroke type, timeliness of intervention, and patient factors. Globally, the 30-day case fatality rate for stroke ranges from 10% to 20%, with estimates varying by region and healthcare access; for instance, a worldwide analysis reported a 13.5% one-month case fatality for ischemic stroke. Hemorrhagic stroke carries a higher mortality risk, with 30-day rates often exceeding 30%, such as 29.7% to 54.6% for intracerebral hemorrhage depending on age, compared to around 5-16% for ischemic stroke. Recent 2025 data from the World Stroke Organization indicate that stroke accounts for over 7.25 million annual deaths globally, with projections suggesting a 50% increase by 2050, underscoring the persistent acute burden.\n\nFunctional recovery in the immediate post-stroke period is commonly assessed using the Modified Rankin Scale (mRS), a 7-point ordinal scale (0-6) measuring disability, with evaluations typically at 90 days. A good outcome, defined as mRS ≤2 (indicating slight or no disability), is achieved in approximately 50% of patients receiving timely reperfusion therapy, such as intravenous thrombolysis or endovascular thrombectomy within the recommended time windows. For example, in acute ischemic stroke trials, early intervention has been associated with favorable 90-day mRS scores in 40-60% of cases, highlighting the impact of rapid treatment on short-term prognosis.\n\nCommon early complications include seizures and infections, which can worsen outcomes. Early seizures occur in 5-10% of stroke patients, typically within the first two weeks, and are more frequent in hemorrhagic cases or those with cortical involvement. Post-stroke infections, such as pneumonia or urinary tract infections, affect approximately 9% of patients in the acute phase (with pneumonia in 12% and urinary tract infections in 8%), contributing to increased mortality and disability; a 2024 meta-analysis reported an overall infection rate of 9.14% among acute stroke cases.\n\nDischarge disposition is influenced by age and stroke severity, with older patients and those with more severe deficits less likely to return home. Advanced age (e.g., ≥85 years) increases the odds of discharge to a skilled nursing facility by 37% compared to home, while higher stroke severity on admission predicts institutional care over community discharge in up to 25% of cases. These factors guide post-acute care planning to optimize recovery.\n\n### Long-Term Effects\n\nApproximately 50% of stroke survivors experience permanent physical deficits, such as hemiparesis, aphasia, or sensory impairments, which significantly limit daily functioning and independence. These disabilities often persist for years, with studies indicating that one-third of long-term survivors remain moderately to severely disabled five years post-event. The risk of recurrent stroke compounds these challenges, occurring at a rate of about 10% per year among survivors without optimal secondary prevention.\n\nCognitive decline is a common long-term consequence, with 20-30% of ischemic stroke survivors developing vascular dementia, characterized by impairments in memory, executive function, and processing speed. Emotional sequelae, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), affect up to 25% of survivors, manifesting as intrusive memories of the event, hypervigilance, and avoidance behaviors that hinder recovery.\n\nQuality of life diminishes for many survivors due to these effects, with caregiver burden emerging as a key issue; recent analyses show that 67% of primary caregivers report some level of burden (61% mild to moderate and 6% severe) from managing physical and emotional needs. Studies from 2025 highlight increased social isolation among survivors, particularly in younger cohorts, where stigma and reduced participation exacerbate loneliness and correlate with poorer rehabilitation outcomes.\n\nAdherence to secondary prevention strategies, such as antihypertensive therapy, antiplatelet agents, and lifestyle modifications, is crucial for mitigating recurrence and preserving function, yet up to 20% of survivors exhibit poor compliance, underscoring the need for targeted interventions.\n\n## Epidemiology\n\n### Global Burden\n\nStroke imposes a substantial burden on global health systems and economies, manifesting as a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. In 2021, there were an estimated 11.9 million incident strokes globally, marking a 70% increase from 1990 levels, with projections suggesting this figure could approach 13 million new cases by 2025 due to ongoing demographic shifts. Stroke is the second leading cause of death and the primary contributor to disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost from non-communicable diseases, affecting one in four individuals over age 25 during their lifetime.)\n\nMortality from stroke reached 7.3 million deaths in 2021, a 44% rise since 1990, with 87% of these occurring in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This escalation is largely driven by population aging and rising prevalence of modifiable risk factors in LMICs, where healthcare access remains limited. Globally, stroke accounts for approximately 11% of all deaths, underscoring its position as a major public health challenge.00369-7/fulltext)\n\nThe disability burden is profound, with stroke responsible for 160.5 million DALYs in 2021—a 32% increase over three decades—predominantly from long-term neurological impairments. Economically, the global cost exceeds $890 billion annually, equivalent to 0.66% of world GDP, encompassing direct medical expenses, rehabilitation, and productivity losses; this figure is projected to nearly double by 2050 without intensified interventions.\n\nTrends reveal a divergence: age-standardized incidence and mortality rates have declined in high-income countries due to effective prevention strategies, such as blood pressure control and smoking cessation programs, yet absolute numbers continue to rise globally, particularly in LMICs where 89% of DALYs are concentrated. These patterns highlight the urgent need for equitable resource allocation to mitigate the escalating impact in resource-constrained regions.\n\n### Trends and Disparities\n\nIn high-income countries, age-standardized stroke incidence rates have declined by approximately 20% from 1990 to 2025, primarily attributable to improved control of modifiable risk factors such as hypertension, smoking, and dyslipidemia through public health initiatives and medical advancements. This downward trend reflects broader successes in primary prevention, including widespread adoption of antihypertensive therapies and lifestyle interventions, which have contributed to a 42% reduction in stroke incidence since the 1970s in these regions.\n\nIn contrast, low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) have experienced rising stroke burdens, driven by rapid urbanization, inadequate hypertension management, and increasing prevalence of obesity and diabetes. Projections indicate a 67% increase in global stroke deaths by 2050, with over 90% of these occurring in LMICs due to aging populations and limited access to preventive care. For context, the global incidence of stroke reached 11.9 million cases in 2021, underscoring the shifting epicenter toward LMICs.\n\nRacial and ethnic disparities exacerbate stroke risks, with Black Americans facing roughly twice the incidence rate of first-ever stroke compared to White Americans, linked to higher prevalence of hypertension and socioeconomic barriers to care. Gender disparities further compound these inequalities, as women often encounter delays in access to acute stroke treatment and rehabilitation services, resulting in worse outcomes and higher post-stroke disability rates.\n\nAs of 2025, the lingering effects of COVID-19 have amplified vascular risks, with SARS-CoV-2 infection associated with accelerated vascular aging—equivalent to five years of additional damage—and a threefold elevated likelihood of stroke up to 14 weeks post-infection. This legacy includes persistent endothelial dysfunction and heightened thrombotic tendencies, particularly among those with severe prior infections, contributing to a sustained increase in cardiovascular events including stroke.\n\n## History\n\n### Early Discoveries\n\nThe earliest documented descriptions of stroke-like symptoms appear in ancient Greek medicine, where the condition was termed \"apoplexy,\" derived from the Greek word meaning \"struck down\" or \"disabled by a stroke.\" Around 460–370 BCE, Hippocrates, often regarded as the father of medicine, provided one of the first clinical accounts in the Hippocratic Corpus, characterizing apoplexy as a sudden onset of paralysis, often one-sided, accompanied by loss of sensation, speech difficulties, and coma, which he attributed to an overflow of phlegm or blood into the brain or its vessels. This humoral theory dominated medical thought for centuries, framing apoplexy as a result of imbalances in bodily fluids rather than vascular pathology.\n\nIn the 17th century, advances in autopsy techniques began to reveal the underlying mechanisms of apoplexy. Swiss physician Johann Jakob Wepfer, in his 1658 work *Observationes Anatomicae*, conducted postmortem examinations that identified cerebral hemorrhage as a primary cause, describing ruptured blood vessels and extravasated blood in the brains of apoplexy victims, thus shifting focus from humoral imbalances to vascular rupture. Wepfer's observations, including cases of carotid artery thrombosis, marked a pivotal step toward recognizing stroke as a cerebrovascular event, though he still invoked some humoral elements in his explanations.\n\nThe 19th century brought further refinements in understanding stroke through pathological and clinical studies. In the 1840s, German pathologist Rudolf Virchow introduced the concept of thrombosis as a key factor in cerebrovascular occlusion, describing how blood clots could form in vessels and lead to ischemic brain damage; he also coined the term \"embolism\" for detached thrombi traveling to the brain, establishing a foundational framework for non-hemorrhagic strokes. Concurrently, in 1861, French surgeon Paul Broca reported on patients with aphasia following left-hemisphere lesions, localizing language production to the posterior inferior frontal gyrus (now known as Broca's area) through autopsy correlations, thereby linking specific stroke sites to focal neurological deficits like expressive aphasia.\n\nEarly treatments for stroke, spanning the 17th and 18th centuries, were largely symptomatic and rooted in humoral theory, with bloodletting being a predominant intervention to restore fluid balance and reduce intracranial pressure. Physicians frequently employed venesection or leeches to withdraw blood, often up to several pints, believing it alleviated congestion; however, this practice proved largely ineffective and potentially harmful, exacerbating weakness in already compromised patients. Such approaches persisted until the late 19th century, when pathological insights began to inform more targeted care, contrasting sharply with modern imaging and thrombolytic therapies.\n\n### Modern Developments\n\nThe development of computed tomography (CT) in the early 1970s revolutionized stroke diagnosis by enabling rapid, non-invasive imaging to differentiate ischemic from hemorrhagic strokes, a critical distinction for treatment decisions. Invented by Godfrey Hounsfield and Allan Cormack, the first CT scanner produced images in 1971, allowing physicians to visualize brain infarcts and bleeds within minutes, which previously relied on invasive procedures like lumbar punctures. This advancement dramatically reduced diagnostic delays and improved patient outcomes by facilitating timely interventions.\n\nIn the 1990s, the pivotal NINDS trial established intravenous thrombolysis as a standard treatment for acute ischemic stroke. Published in 1995, the trial demonstrated that recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), administered within three hours of symptom onset, significantly improved clinical outcomes at three months compared to placebo, with 11-13% absolute risk reduction in disability. This double-blind, randomized study involved 624 patients and marked the first FDA-approved therapy for stroke, shifting paradigms from supportive care to active clot dissolution despite risks like intracranial hemorrhage.\n\nThe 2010s saw endovascular thrombectomy emerge as a transformative intervention through landmark trials like MR CLEAN in 2015. This multicenter randomized trial showed that intra-arterial mechanical clot retrieval, combined with standard care, improved functional independence in 32.6% of patients with proximal intracranial occlusions versus 19.1% with medical therapy alone, even up to six hours post-onset. Building on earlier failures of catheter-based approaches, MR CLEAN's success—reducing disability by 1.67 odds on the modified Rankin Scale—led to guideline expansions for extended treatment windows and inspired subsequent trials like ESCAPE and EXTEND-IA.\n\nBy 2025, artificial intelligence (AI) diagnostics and regenerative medicine trials represent the current era's frontiers in stroke care. AI algorithms enhance imaging analysis for detecting large vessel occlusions on CT angiography with high accuracy, often exceeding 90% in studies, enabling faster triage in emergency settings and reducing door-to-needle times. Concurrently, regenerative trials using stem cell therapies have shown promise; for instance, a September 2025 Zurich study demonstrated that transplanted neural stem cells regenerated neurons and restored motor function in preclinical mouse models. These developments, rooted in earlier diagnostic and therapeutic milestones, continue to expand recovery potential beyond traditional timelines.\n\n## Research\n\n### Current Advances\n\nRecent advances in stroke treatment have focused on expanding therapeutic windows and optimizing thrombolytic agents. The SELECT2 trial, published in 2023 with 2024 follow-up data, demonstrated that endovascular thrombectomy provides significant benefits for patients with large-core ischemic strokes up to 24 hours after symptom onset, improving functional outcomes at 90 days and sustaining gains at one year compared to medical management alone. In this multicenter randomized trial involving 252 patients, thrombectomy reduced mortality and enhanced modified Rankin Scale scores, with 24% of treated patients achieving independence at one year versus 6% in the control group. These findings build on earlier trials like NINDS by extending eligibility to larger infarcts previously considered ineligible.\n\nIn neuroprotection, comparisons between tenecteplase (TNK) and alteplase have shown TNK's potential as a superior thrombolytic. A 2025 meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials indicated that TNK, administered within 4.5 hours, achieved better recanalization rates compared to alteplase, with no increase in symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage and no difference in 90-day mortality. Specifically, in the NOR-TEST and EXTEND trials integrated into 2025 analyses, TNK at 0.25 mg/kg dosing showed a modest improvement in excellent functional outcomes (RR 1.06). Further 2025 results from trials assessing extended windows confirmed TNK's non-inferiority and signals of efficacy up to 24 hours.\n\nPrecision medicine approaches are advancing through genetic profiling to tailor anticoagulant therapy, particularly for secondary stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation patients. Recent studies from 2020-2025 highlight pharmacogenomic testing for variants like CYP2C9 and VKORC1, which influence warfarin dosing and reduce bleeding risks by up to 30% in genetically guided regimens. A 2025 review in cardiovascular pharmacogenomics emphasized integrating genomic data with AI to personalize direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), minimizing adverse events while enhancing efficacy in high-risk stroke populations. These strategies, informed by genome-wide association studies, enable risk stratification and drug selection based on individual polygenic scores.\n\nTele-stroke programs have seen widespread adoption, significantly reducing treatment disparities as reported in 2025 American Heart Association (AHA) analyses. AHA data indicate that telestroke networks, now integrated into over 70% of U.S. stroke centers, have increased thrombolytic administration in rural and underserved areas by 55%, narrowing racial and geographic gaps in timely care. A 2025 AHA advisory on digital health noted that these programs lowered door-to-needle times by 20 minutes on average in low-resource settings, improving outcomes for minority populations disproportionately affected by stroke. This expansion has contributed to a 15% reduction in disparities for acute interventions per recent cohort studies.\n\n### Future Directions\n\nOngoing research in stroke therapy is increasingly focusing on regenerative approaches to restore damaged neural tissue, with stem cell therapies showing particular promise in preclinical models. Neural stem cell transplants have demonstrated the ability to regenerate neurons and reverse motor function deficits in animal models of ischemic stroke, as evidenced by studies where transplanted cells integrated into the brain and promoted functional recovery even weeks after injury. Similarly, advancements in gene editing technologies, such as CRISPR-Cas9, are being explored to precisely correct genetic factors contributing to neuronal damage and inflammation post-stroke, with preclinical investigations indicating potential for mitigating neurodegeneration and enhancing tissue repair. These 2025 preclinical successes highlight a shift toward therapies that not only limit initial damage but actively reverse it, though clinical translation remains a key challenge due to issues like immune rejection and long-term efficacy.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning are poised to transform stroke management through predictive analytics for risk assessment and outcome forecasting, integrated with wearable technologies. AI algorithms analyzing data from smartwatches and sensors have achieved high accuracy in early stroke detection, with systematic reviews reporting predictive performances exceeding 90% in identifying at-risk individuals via biometric patterns like heart rate variability and movement. Wearable integration enables real-time monitoring, allowing for personalized risk stratification and timely interventions, particularly in atrial fibrillation-related strokes where explainable AI models improve equity in care delivery. By 2025, these tools are advancing toward distributed precision care, combining smartphone apps and sensors to predict outcomes like modified Rankin Scale scores from accelerometry data, potentially reducing disparities in remote or underserved populations.\n\nNanotechnology offers innovative solutions for targeted drug delivery to the ischemic penumbra, the salvageable brain tissue surrounding the core infarct. Recent nanosystems, such as biomimetic nanoparticles coated with cell membranes, enhance blood-brain barrier penetration and selectively release neuroprotective agents like neurotrophins directly to the penumbra, minimizing off-target effects and improving therapeutic windows. These multifunctional carriers, including liposomes and polymeric nanoparticles, have shown in preclinical models to reduce infarct size by up to 40% through sustained release of anti-inflammatory drugs, addressing the limitations of systemic administration. As of 2025, ongoing developments emphasize stimuli-responsive nanocarriers that respond to the hypoxic penumbral environment, paving the way for more effective reperfusion adjuncts.\n\nPrevention strategies are evolving with vaccine-like immunotherapies targeting atherosclerosis, a primary driver of ischemic stroke. Experimental vaccines against oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) and other plaque antigens have demonstrated preclinical efficacy in reducing arterial inflammation and plaque buildup, with 2025 studies in animal models showing up to 50% decrease in atherosclerotic lesion progression. A novel nanovaccine developed by Chinese researchers targets plaque formation to prevent cardiovascular events, including stroke, by modulating immune responses without broad immunosuppression. To address global disparities, international trials are incorporating equity-focused designs, prioritizing enrollment from low-resource settings to evaluate these interventions' accessibility and impact on high-burden populations.",
