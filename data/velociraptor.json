  "content": "# _Velociraptor_\n\n*Velociraptor* is a genus of small dromaeosaurid theropod dinosaurs that lived during the Late Cretaceous epoch, approximately 75 to 71 million years ago, in what is now Mongolia and northern China. The genus comprises two species: the type species *V. mongoliensis*, discovered in the Gobi Desert of Mongolia, and *V. osmolskae*, found in Inner Mongolia. These bipedal carnivores were about 1.8 meters (6 feet) long, weighed approximately 15 kilograms (33 pounds), and featured a long, stiff tail for balance, approximately 28 serrated teeth, and enlarged sickle-shaped claws on their second toes, which were likely used to slash and grip prey.\n\nThe first *Velociraptor* fossils were unearthed in 1923 during expeditions to the Gobi Desert by the American Museum of Natural History, with the genus formally described in 1924 by Henry Fairfield Osborn based on a skull and partial skeleton from the Djadokhta Formation. Subsequent discoveries, including well-preserved specimens showing evidence of feathers, have revealed *Velociraptor* as a feathered dinosaur with proto-wing-like arms, though incapable of flight. Notable fossils include the famous \"Fighting Dinosaurs\" specimen, capturing *V. mongoliensis* locked in combat with a *Protoceratops andrewsi*.\n\nPaleobiological studies indicate that *Velociraptor* was an agile predator, capable of detecting a wide range of sound frequencies (2,368–3,965 Hz) similar to modern ravens, which aided in tracking prey through keen hearing and balance. It likely hunted small mammals, lizards, and possibly scavenged, using its claws and jaws to subdue victims, though there is no strong evidence for pack hunting as popularized in media. Endocranial reconstructions show bird-like brain features, supporting high agility and sensory acuity in its arid, desert-like habitat.\n\n## Discovery and Research History\n\n### Initial Discoveries\n\nThe holotype specimen of *Velociraptor mongoliensis* (AMNH 6515), consisting of a crushed but complete skull, lower jaws, and a raptorial claw with associated phalanges, was discovered on August 11, 1923, by expedition member Peter C. Kaisen at the Flaming Cliffs (Ukhaa Tolgod, also known as Shabarakh Usu) in Mongolia's Gobi Desert. This find occurred during the second Central Asiatic Expedition (1922–1923) organized by the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) under the leadership of Roy Chapman Andrews, aimed at exploring the paleontological riches of Central Asia. The specimen was collected from the Djadochta Formation in the Protoceratops zone, a Late Cretaceous deposit renowned for its well-preserved dinosaur fossils.\n\nIn 1924, AMNH president Henry Fairfield Osborn formally named and described the genus and species *Velociraptor mongoliensis* based on this partial material, emphasizing its diminutive skull (approximately 176 mm long) and serrated, recurved teeth as indicative of a carnivorous theropod. Osborn classified it within the Megalosauridae family, then a broad grouping for many carnivorous dinosaurs, and highlighted its raptorial adaptations, including the large, curved claw initially interpreted as from the manus (hand). The early 1920s expeditions by the AMNH, including the 1923 trip, played a pivotal role in revealing the Gobi's theropod diversity, yielding multiple small carnivorous dinosaur fossils from the Djadochta Formation alongside ceratopsians like *Protoceratops*.\n\nDue to the limited and fragmentary nature of the initial material—primarily the damaged skull—early interpretations portrayed *Velociraptor* as a small, agile predator adapted for swift movement and prey seizure, though with an incomplete understanding of its full skeletal posture and locomotor dynamics. These foundational discoveries laid the groundwork for later finds, such as the iconic \"Fighting Dinosaurs\" specimen preserving a *Velociraptor* in combat with a *Protoceratops*.\n\n### Key Specimens and Species Recognition\n\nOne of the most iconic specimens of *Velociraptor mongoliensis* is the \"Fighting Dinosaurs\" fossil (MPC-D 100/25, formerly GIN 100/25), discovered on August 3, 1971, during a joint Polish-Mongolian paleontological expedition at the Tugrik locality in the Djadokhta Formation of Mongolia's Gobi Desert. This exceptionally preserved specimen captures an adult *V. mongoliensis* in a dynamic death struggle with a *Protoceratops andrewsi*, with the theropod's sickle claw embedded in the ceratopsian's neck and the latter gripping the raptor's arm, suggesting a predatory encounter interrupted by rapid burial, likely from a collapsing sand dune or storm. The find provides direct evidence of behavioral interactions between these taxa, including potential hunting strategies, and has been housed at the Mongolian Natural History Museum since its recovery.\n\nIn 2008, a second species, *V. osmolskae*, was named based on associated cranial elements including paired maxillae (IGM 100/986) and a left lacrimal (IGM 100/987), collected in 1999 from the Bayan Mandahu Formation (Campanian stage) near Bayn Mandahu, Inner Mongolia, China.28[432:ANSOVD]2.0.CO;2/10.1671/0272-4634(2008)28[432:ANSOVD]2.0.CO;2.full) These specimens are distinguished from *V. mongoliensis* primarily by a deeper maxilla with a more elongate rostral process and differences in the antorbital fenestra shape, indicating subtle morphological variation within the genus during the Late Cretaceous.28[432:ANSOVD]2.0.CO;2/10.1671/0272-4634(2008)28[432:ANSOVD]2.0.CO;2.full) The naming honors paleontologist Halszka Osmólska, and the material represents the only known *Velociraptor* fossils from outside Mongolia, expanding the geographic range of the genus.\n\nA partial skull (MPC-D 100/982), recovered in 1992 from the Djadokhta Formation at Bayn Dzak, Mongolia, was analyzed in a 2020 master's thesis using morphometric methods, revealing features such as a shallow maxilla and distinct neuroanatomical traits that suggest it may represent a third, unnamed species of *Velociraptor* (provisionally *V. vadarostrum*, though a nomen nudum). This specimen differs from *V. mongoliensis* in pelvic morphology and from *V. osmolskae* in cranial depth, highlighting intraspecific or interspecific diversity in the Djadokhta fauna.\n\nSpecimen IGM 100/3503, consisting of a feathered right arm from the Zos Wash locality in the Djadokhta Formation, has been tentatively referred to *Velociraptor mongoliensis* based on comparative postcranial features, though its assignment remains under review pending more comprehensive study. This referral supports evidence of integumentary structures in the genus but requires verification against other dromaeosaurids from the region. In contrast, a related dromaeosaurid skull from the Bayan Mandahu Formation was described in 2021 as *Shri devi* (ZPAL MgD-I/97), a distinct taxon outside *Velociraptor* characterized by unique cranial proportions convergent with North American forms.\n\nRecent advancements in imaging, including CT scans of specimens like MPC-D 100/976 from 2020, have enabled 3D reconstructions of internal anatomy, such as the endocranium and inner ear, revealing details of sensory capabilities like a wide range of sound frequencies (2,368–3,965 Hz) and enhanced olfaction. These non-destructive techniques, combined with photogrammetric modeling (e.g., of holotype AMNH FARB 6515 using 186 photographs), have improved taphonomic interpretations by visualizing burial dynamics and preserving fragile structures without physical preparation.\n\n## Anatomy and Morphology\n\n### Cranial Features\n\nThe skull of *Velociraptor mongoliensis* measured up to 23 cm in length, characterized by a long, low profile that comprised approximately 60% preorbital region, with a narrow and shallow snout adapted for precise predatory strikes. This structure included a prominent premaxillary fenestra positioned rostrally and a large, teardrop-shaped antorbital fenestra, the latter bordered by the maxilla and nasal bones, which contributed to the lightweight yet robust cranial architecture typical of dromaeosaurids. The premaxilla bore four teeth, with the first two being notably larger and weakly curved, facilitating initial prey engagement.\n\nKey osteological features included narrow and depressed nasal bones, which formed an L-shaped cross-section and exhibited loose internasal contact, enhancing the skull's flexibility and reducing overall mass. The lacrimal bones were prominent, featuring T-shaped horns with a slender rostral process extending to the mid-nasal region and no separate prefrontal element, a configuration that reinforced the orbital margin for structural integrity during rapid head movements. The quadrate bone was non-pneumatic with a single head, a caudally bowed shaft, and a mandibular process featuring a larger lateral condyle, indicative of strong jaw-closing mechanics capable of withstanding torsional stresses.\n\nDentition consisted of 27–30 serrated, recurved teeth overall, designed for slicing flesh, with a formula of 4 premaxillary, 11 maxillary, and 14–15 dentary teeth; the maxillary teeth were slender and increasingly curved caudally, bearing fine serrations (approximately 9 denticles per 2 mm distally) that optimized tearing efficiency. A phylogenetic analysis of jaw adductor muscle cross-sections estimated *Velociraptor*'s bite force at up to 304 N, with finite element modeling revealing high cranial resistance to such loads, potentially suited for scavenging tougher tissues or intraspecific interactions.\n\n### Postcranial Skeleton\n\nThe postcranial skeleton of *Velociraptor mongoliensis* is characterized by adaptations that supported its agile, predatory lifestyle, including a flexible neck, powerful limbs for grasping and slashing, and a stiffened tail for balance. The axial skeleton features 10 cervical vertebrae that are elongated relative to the trunk, providing neck flexibility for maneuvering during hunts, with wide neural arches and prominent epipophyses enhancing range of motion. Cervical ribs are short and fused to their vertebrae in some specimens, contributing to structural integrity without adding excess weight. The ribcage consists of robust dorsal ribs that are pneumatic in proximal portions, lightening the torso while maintaining rigidity, and paired gastralia that reinforced the abdominal wall, collectively supporting a lightweight build suited for rapid movements.\n\nThe forelimbs are robust and well-developed, emphasizing their role in prey restraint. The humerus is sturdy with a prominent deltopectoral crest for muscle attachment, while the ulna exhibits posteriorly curved shafts and distinct quill knobs on its posterior surface, indicating attachment sites for integumentary structures. The manus comprises three elongated digits, with digit II bearing the largest retractable sickle-shaped claw, measuring up to 6.5 cm along the dorsal curve, enabling precise gripping and tearing actions during predation. Digit III is subequal in length to digit II but with a smaller ungual, and digit I is the shortest, forming a functional three-fingered hand optimized for manipulation.\n\nHindlimbs display powerful proportions adapted for speed and lethal strikes, with a robust femur featuring a trochanteric crest and globular head for strong propulsion, paired with a slightly longer, equally sturdy tibia. The foot exhibits an arctometatarsal structure, where metatarsal III is pinched proximally between II and IV, reducing weight and enhancing cursorial efficiency for high-speed pursuits. The hypertrophied second pedal ungual forms a prominent sickle claw up to 9 cm in length, used for slashing and immobilizing prey by embedding into flesh. The slender fibula complements this setup, allowing flexion at the knee and ankle for agile foot placement.\n\nThe pelvis and tail further underscore *Velociraptor*'s balance and stability during dynamic activities. The ilium is dolichoiliac with a sigmoid profile, the pubis is retroverted at approximately 155°, and the ischia are T-shaped and about half the pubis length, forming a configuration that accommodated powerful leg muscles. The tail consists of around 25 caudal vertebrae, with proximal segments stiffened by elongated, overlapping pre- and postzygapophyses along with ossified tendons that form rigid rods, preventing lateral flexure and aiding counterbalance in high-speed turns or leaps. This stiff tail structure, transitioning to more flexible distal portions, was crucial for maintaining postural control during predatory chases.\n\n### Size and Proportions\n\nVelociraptor mongoliensis exhibited a compact yet agile physique typical of mid-sized dromaeosaurids, with adult specimens measuring 1.5–2.07 m in total body length from the snout to the tail tip. Hip height reached approximately 0.5 m, contributing to its low-slung posture suited for swift maneuvers. Weight estimates, based on volumetric reconstructions of key fossils like the holotype AMNH 6515, fall between 14.1 and 19.7 kg, reflecting a lightweight frame optimized for predation in arid environments.\n\nThe dinosaur's proportions emphasized a slender, elongated build, with the tail extending up to 1 m and accounting for nearly 50% of the overall length; this rigid structure, supported by ossified tendons across about 25 caudal vertebrae, provided counterbalance during rapid movements. Hindlimbs featured elongated femora, tibiae, and metatarsi that enhanced cursorial capabilities without excessive bulk.\n\nEvidence for sexual dimorphism is tentative, potentially manifested in subtle variations in pedal claw size across specimens, but remains unconfirmed owing to the scarcity of complete skeletons for comparative analysis. Relative to other dromaeosaurids, Velociraptor was diminutive compared to Deinonychus antirrhopus, which attained lengths of 3–3.4 m and masses up to 73 kg, highlighting scaling differences within the clade.\n\n## Taxonomy\n\n### Classification and Naming\n\nVelociraptor is a genus of small dromaeosaurid theropod dinosaur, classified within the clade Theropoda, specifically in the subgroup Coelurosauria, which encompasses advanced carnivorous dinosaurs closely related to birds. It belongs to the clade Maniraptora, characterized by bird-like adaptations such as elongated forelimbs, and is further nested in the family Dromaeosauridae, known for their sickle-shaped foot claws and cursorial build. Within Dromaeosauridae, Velociraptor is placed in the subclade Eudromaeosauria, comprising more derived Laurasian forms, and the subfamily Velociraptorinae, defined as dromaeosaurids more closely related to Velociraptor than to Dromaeosaurus.\n\nThe genus name Velociraptor was coined by paleontologist Henry Fairfield Osborn in 1924, derived from the Latin *velox* meaning \"swift\" or \"speedy,\" and *raptor* meaning \"seizer\" or \"thief,\" alluding to the animal's presumed agile predatory habits. The type species is *V. mongoliensis*, formally described by Osborn based on the holotype specimen AMNH 6515, consisting of a partial skull and right manus (hand) from the Djadokhta Formation in Mongolia's Gobi Desert. A second species, *V. osmolskae*, was named in 2008 by Pascal Godefroit and colleagues, honoring Polish paleontologist Halszka Osmólska; its holotype is IMM 99NM-BYM-3/3, comprising associated paired maxillae and a left lacrimal bone from the Bayan Mandahu Formation in Inner Mongolia, China. Specimen IGM 100/986, a partial skeleton including postcranial elements from the Djadokhta Formation, has been referred to *V. osmolskae* in some analyses due to shared features like maxillary tooth morphology, serving as a key comparative specimen though not formally designated as a neotype.\n\nUpon its initial description, Osborn placed Velociraptor in the family Megalosauridae, a broad and poorly defined group for many carnivorous theropods of the era lacking refined phylogenetic context. This classification persisted until the mid-20th century, when the 1969 description of *Deinonychus antirrhopus* by John H. Ostrom highlighted anatomical similarities, including the enlarged sickle claw and cursorial adaptations, prompting its reclassification into Dromaeosauridae—a family originally erected in 1922 for *Dromaeosaurus*. Subsequent cladistic analyses in the 1980s and 1990s, building on Jacques Gauthier's foundational work, solidified its position within Coelurosauria and Maniraptora, emphasizing shared derived traits like a flexible wrist and quill knobs indicative of feathering.\n\n### Phylogenetic Relationships\n\nVelociraptor is positioned within the clade Velociraptorinae, a subgroup of Eudromaeosauria, where *V. mongoliensis* is often recovered as the sister taxon to Deinonychus based on shared derived traits such as the enlarged, sickle-shaped pedal ungual on digit II for prey grasping and ulnar quill knobs indicating feathered forelimbs; however, recent analyses show varying topologies.\n\nIn broader phylogenetic analyses, Velociraptor forms part of the Dromaeosauridae radiation during the Late Cretaceous, with its closest relatives including Tsaagan and Linheraptor, both Asian taxa also nested within Velociraptorinae.\n\nCladistic studies, including character matrices from Norell and Makovicky (2004) that highlighted dromaeosaurid skeletal features supporting Velociraptorine monophyly, and subsequent updates in Turner et al. (2012) incorporating additional taxa and characters, consistently recover Eudromaeosauria as a well-supported clade encompassing Velociraptorinae, Dromaeosaurinae, and Saurornitholestinae. Recent work, such as Czepiński (2023), further refines relationships within Velociraptorinae but notes inconsistencies in placements of referred material.\n\nThe evolutionary origins of Dromaeosauridae trace back to approximately 80 million years ago in the Late Cretaceous, with Velociraptor diverging around 75 million years ago in Asia, as evidenced by its fossils from the Campanian-aged Djadokhta Formation.\n\n### Species Validity and Debates\n\nThe validity of *Velociraptor osmolskae* has been debated since its description, primarily due to significant morphological overlap with the type species *V. mongoliensis*. A comprehensive phylogenetic analysis questioned its distinctiveness, noting that the limited cranial material shows features within the variation range of *V. mongoliensis*, and excluding *V. osmolskae* could render the genus paraphyletic. However, more recent phylogenetic analyses, including a 2025 review, continue to question its placement within Velociraptor and support erecting a new genus for it, as it is recovered closer to Linheraptor than to *V. mongoliensis* in some studies (e.g., Evans et al., 2013; Czepiński, 2023).\n\nIn 2020, a detailed morphometric study of the isolated maxilla MPC-D 100/982 proposed it as a third species of *Velociraptor*, distinguished by a deeper maxilla and narrower narial opening compared to known specimens of *V. mongoliensis* and *V. osmolskae*. This assessment utilized landmark-based geometric morphometrics to quantify snout shape variation, suggesting ecological implications for predatory behavior within the genus. However, as this remains an unpublished master's thesis, formal naming and broader phylogenetic integration are pending further verification, and it is currently considered a nomen nudum, sometimes informally referred to as *V. vadarostrum*.\n\nThe referral of the feathered partial skeleton IGM 100/3503 to *Velociraptor* has also faced scrutiny. While initially assigned to the genus based on ulnar quill knobs indicating integument similar to other dromaeosaurids, the specimen number was corrected to IGM 100/3503 in 2021, and while it exhibits some differences from other *V. mongoliensis* specimens, such as relative manual phalanges length, it remains referred to the species, though its assignment may require further evaluation.\n\nThe erection of the new genus *Shri devi* in 2021 from the Barun Goyot Formation further refined taxonomic boundaries for *Velociraptor* in correlative strata like the Bayan Mandahu Formation. This velociraptorine exhibits a unique combination of robust forelimbs and cranial features overlapping with *V. osmolskae*, but phylogenetic analyses position it outside *Velociraptor*, reducing potential synonymy and clarifying species-level distinctions in the region.\n\n## Paleobiology\n\n### Feathers and Integument\n\nDirect evidence for feathers in *Velociraptor mongoliensis* comes from the discovery of quill knobs on the ulna of specimen IGM 100/981, a referred forearm bone from the Djadochta Formation of Mongolia. These six evenly spaced, tubercular projections on the posterior surface of the ulna are homologous to those in modern birds, where they anchor the bases of large secondary flight feathers. The presence of such knobs indicates that *Velociraptor* bore pennaceous (vane-structured) feathers on its arms, likely forming a wing-like arrangement similar to those in other dromaeosaurids, though not adapted for powered flight.\n\nNo direct fossil evidence exists for the integument of the *Velociraptor* body or other regions, as skin impressions have not been preserved in known specimens. However, phylogenetic inference from closely related dromaeosaurids supports extensive feathering. For instance, the basal dromaeosaurid *Sinornithosaurus* preserved simple, filamentous protofeathers across much of its body, while more derived taxa like *Microraptor* exhibited vaned feathers on the limbs and trunk. This suggests *Velociraptor*, as a mid-sized eudromaeosaur, was likely covered in protofeathers or short filaments on the torso and tail for insulation, with longer, vaned pennaceous feathers concentrated on the forelimbs and possibly hindlimbs for display purposes.\n\nInsights into potential feather coloration in *Velociraptor* derive from melanosome analyses in related paravians. In *Microraptor*, electron microscopy revealed densely packed, spherical melanosomes consistent with iridescent black plumage, akin to modern corvids. Similarly, *Sinosauropteryx* (a close coelurosaur relative) showed elongated melanosomes indicating reddish-brown hues with possible stripe patterns. These findings imply *Velociraptor* feathers may have featured iridescent or camouflaged pigmentation for signaling or concealment, though direct evidence is absent.\n\nThis feathered, turkey-sized appearance (approximately 2 meters long and 14-20 kg) starkly contrasts with media portrayals, such as the larger, scaly *Velociraptor* in *Jurassic Park*, which was modeled after the bigger *Deinonychus* without feathers.\n\n### Sensory and Locomotor Adaptations\n\nVelociraptor's visual system featured adaptations for enhanced acuity and depth perception, as evidenced by its large orbits positioned forward on the skull, which facilitated stereoscopic or binocular vision essential for tracking prey in three dimensions. CT scans of the braincase, such as those from specimen IGM 100/976, reveal an overall cranial structure supporting high visual reliance, though the optic lobes themselves were not preserved in this individual. Additionally, the sclerotic rings—bony structures encircling the eye—indicate that Velociraptor was at least partially nocturnal or cathemeral (active during both day and night), with ring morphology suggesting an intermediate light-gathering capacity between fully diurnal and nocturnal archosaurs.\n\nThe sense of smell in Velociraptor was notably acute, with olfactory bulbs comprising approximately 35.7% of the cerebral hemisphere volume based on endocast measurements, a ratio exceeding expectations for theropods of its estimated 13 kg body mass. This proportionally large olfactory region implies a strong reliance on olfaction for detecting scents over distances, potentially aiding in locating carcasses for scavenging or navigating in dim conditions where vision might be limited.\n\nAuditory adaptations in Velociraptor included a relatively long and wide endosseous cochlear duct within the middle ear, measuring about 11.15 mm in length, which housed the basilar papilla and enabled detection of a broad frequency range from approximately 2,368 Hz to 3,965 Hz. This hearing profile, comparable to that of modern birds like ravens and penguins, suggests sensitivity to mid-range frequencies suitable for perceiving vocalizations or environmental cues during social or predatory activities.\n\nFor locomotion, Velociraptor's hindlimb proportions, including a high ratio of femur to tibia length, indicate cursorial adaptations for agile movement, with biomechanical models estimating a maximum running speed of around 40 km/h. Analogies from theropod trackways further support moderate sprinting capabilities, though recent analyses caution that such estimates may overestimate speeds by up to 2-4 times due to assumptions in stride length calculations. The tail, stiffened by elongated prezygapophyses and chevrons along much of its length, served as a counterbalance to stabilize the body during rapid turns and accelerations, enhancing maneuverability in pursuits or evasions.\n\n### Diet, Feeding, and Predatory Behavior\n\nVelociraptor was a carnivorous predator that primarily targeted small to medium-sized herbivores, with strong evidence indicating Protoceratops as a key prey species. Fossil associations, including bite marks on Protoceratops bones matching Velociraptor dentition, demonstrate direct trophic interactions between the two dinosaurs. These marks, often found on scattered skeletal elements, suggest Velociraptor fed on Protoceratops carcasses, reinforcing its role as an active carnivore in the Late Cretaceous ecosystem of Mongolia.\n\nThe feeding mechanics of Velociraptor were adapted for efficient prey dispatch and tissue consumption, featuring a flexible skull that permitted a wide jaw gape to accommodate struggling victims. Its dentition consisted of ziphodont teeth—curved, serrated blades with fine denticles—that facilitated slashing and puncturing of flesh rather than whole-prey ingestion. Recent biomechanical analyses indicate that the Velociraptor skull exhibited high resistance to bite forces, enabling it to withstand stresses during scavenging or feeding on tougher materials, though not to the extent of bone-crushing seen in larger theropods.\n\nPredatory behavior in Velociraptor likely involved close-quarters grappling, as evidenced by the iconic \"Fighting Dinosaurs\" specimen (MPC-D 100/25), which preserves a Velociraptor locked in combat with a Protoceratops, its sickle-shaped pedal claw embedded in the herbivore's neck. This posture suggests the use of enlarged second pedal claws for restraining and piercing vital areas, combined with manual claws for additional hold during attacks. Hunting was probably conducted solitarily or in small, opportunistic groups rather than coordinated packs, as no fossil evidence supports large-scale social predation, contrasting with popularized depictions.\n\nEvidence for scavenging includes tooth marks on Protoceratops bones indicative of late-stage feeding on already deceased or weakened individuals, with patterns suggesting Velociraptor opportunistically accessed marrow or remaining soft tissues. Additional support comes from a Velociraptor specimen (MPC 100/986) preserving a pterosaur bone in its abdominal cavity, interpreted as scavenged remains. Tooth wear patterns, characterized by polish and micro-abrasions consistent with processing desiccated or bone-adjacent tissues, further point to a mixed predatory-scavenging strategy that supplemented active hunts.\n\n### Physiology and Metabolism\n\nBone histology of Velociraptor and closely related dromaeosaurids, such as Deinonychus, reveals fibrolamellar bone tissue characterized by high vascularity and extensive secondary Haversian remodeling, features associated with rapid somatic growth and elevated metabolic rates typical of endothermic vertebrates. This remodeling process, involving the resorption and redeposition of bone to accommodate mechanical stress and nutrient supply, is rare in extant ectotherms but common in birds and mammals, supporting inferences of endothermy in these theropods. Such histological patterns indicate that Velociraptor maintained a high resting metabolic rate, enabling sustained activity levels beyond those of typical reptiles.\n\nGrowth trajectories in Velociraptor were rapid, with the transition from juvenile to adult size occurring within 2–3 years, as estimated from lines of arrested growth (LAGs) in long bone cross-sections of comparable small theropods from Gobi Desert formations. For instance, analyses of femoral and tibial sections from specimens like those in the Mongolian Paleontological Center collections show multiple LAGs accumulating early in ontogeny, followed by an external fundamental system signaling growth cessation at small adult body sizes around 14–20 kg. This accelerated pattern, intermediate between reptilian and avian rates, underscores efficient resource allocation for quick maturation in a predatory niche.\n\nThermoregulation in Velociraptor likely involved a combination of insulating integument and respiratory adaptations for heat conservation. Feathers provided thermal insulation, reducing heat loss in the arid Late Cretaceous environment of Mongolia, akin to modern birds. Additionally, the nasal cavity, while lacking preserved bony turbinates, may have housed cartilaginous structures for conditioning inhaled air, minimizing respiratory water and heat loss during high-activity pursuits—features convergent with those in extant endothermic archosaurs.\n\nCardiovascular adaptations further supported endothermic physiology, with evidence from related theropods indicating enlarged aortic arches that facilitated efficient systemic oxygen delivery to tissues under high metabolic demand. This configuration, homologous to the dual aortic system in crocodilians and refined in birds, would have enhanced aerobic capacity for predation and locomotion in Velociraptor.\n\nA 2025 review confirms these inferences on metabolism and growth, with no major revisions as of that date.\n\n### Pathologies and Injuries\n\nEvidence of pathologies and injuries in *Velociraptor* fossils is limited but provides insights into the physical stresses these dinosaurs endured during predation, intraspecific conflicts, and daily activities. The most iconic example is the \"Fighting Dinosaurs\" specimen (MPC-D 100/25), which preserves a *V. mongoliensis* locked in combat with a *Protoceratops andrewsi*. The *Protoceratops* displays broken ribs and possible bite wounds on its neck and frill, indicative of theropod-inflicted trauma during the struggle. The *Velociraptor* shows no fatal skeletal injuries but was positioned with its right arm embedded in the *Protoceratops*'s beak, suggesting acute trauma to the forelimb; both animals likely died from the encounter or rapid burial by a sand dune.\n\nOther specimens reveal non-fatal injuries that healed, demonstrating resilience in *Velociraptor*. A juvenile individual (MPC-D 100/54) preserves a partially healed fracture in one rib, with bone regrowth indicating survival for weeks or months post-injury, possibly from a predatory mishap or fight with conspecifics. Similarly, a healed fracture in a pedal phalanx of specimen IGM 100/982 (referred to *V. mongoliensis*) shows extensive callus formation, suggesting the dinosaur continued to ambulate despite impaired foot function after the trauma.\n\nInfections are documented in at least one case of potential osteomyelitis affecting the jaw of specimen MPC-D 100/405, characterized by bony proliferation and erosion consistent with bacterial invasion, possibly introduced via a bite wound or environmental contamination during feeding. This pathology highlights vulnerability to secondary infections in oral tissues, though the animal's fate remains unknown.\n\nDirect evidence of parasites in *Velociraptor* is absent, but inferences can be drawn from related theropods, where gut contents and coprolites preserve nematode eggs and protozoan cysts indicative of intestinal infestations. These findings suggest *Velociraptor* may have hosted similar endoparasites, acquired through prey consumption, though no such traces have been recovered in its fossils.\n\n## Paleoenvironment and Distribution\n\n### Geological Formations\n\nFossils of *Velociraptor mongoliensis* are primarily recovered from the Djadokhta Formation in southern Mongolia, a highly fossiliferous unit consisting of arid eolian dune sands interbedded with fluvial deposits and interdune pond mudstones. This formation, subdivided into the lower Bayn Dzak Member (reddish sands and mudstones) and upper Tugrugyin Member (paler sands), reflects a semi-arid paleoenvironment with periodic water sources that supported diverse vertebrate assemblages. The type locality for *V. mongoliensis* is at Bayn Dzak (Flaming Cliffs), where the holotype skull was discovered in 1923.\n\nThe age of the Djadokhta Formation is estimated at 75–71 million years ago (Ma), corresponding to the late Campanian stage of the Late Cretaceous, based on magnetostratigraphic correlation to marine chronologies. Recent U-Pb dating of detrital zircons and volcanic components supports this Campanian assignment, confirming the formation's position within the broader Nemegt Basin stratigraphy. Taphonomic evidence from localities like Ukhaa Tolgod reveals mass mortality events, likely triggered by seasonal droughts, where multiple individuals of various taxa accumulated in depressions and were rapidly buried by wind-blown sands, preserving articulated skeletons and even burrows.\n\nThe Bayan Mandahu Formation in Inner Mongolia, China, dated to approximately 75–71 Ma (late Campanian), yields fossils of *Velociraptor osmolskae*, including the holotype skull described in 2008, and represents a contemporaneous or closely equivalent unit to the Djadokhta Formation based on faunal similarities. Composed of redbed sandstones with eolian cross-bedding and fluvial channel fills, it indicates a comparable arid landscape with episodic fluvial activity and dune migration. U-Pb radiometric ages from associated volcanic tuffs affirm its late Campanian placement, correlating it closely with the Djadokhta. Preservation here often involves wind-deflated surfaces and sand-filled burrows, highlighting rapid aeolian burial similar to Mongolian sites.\n\n### Associated Biota and Ecology\n\nThe Djadokhta Formation preserves a diverse vertebrate assemblage indicative of a semi-arid desert ecosystem with eolian dunes, intermittent fluvial systems, and interdune ponds that supported a range of herbivores, predators, and smaller vertebrates. Herbivorous dinosaurs such as the ceratopsian *Protoceratops andrewsi* and the ankylosaur *Pinacosaurus grangeri* were abundant, forming the primary prey base in this environment, while smaller taxa including multituberculate mammals like *Kryptobaatar dashzevegi* and eutherian mammals such as *Zalambdalestes lechei* occupied lower trophic levels as potential scavengers or insectivores. Lizards, including *Isodontosaurus gracilis* and *Carusia intermedia*, and crocodyliforms like *Gobiosuchus kielanae* further contributed to the faunal diversity, likely inhabiting moist interdune areas.\n\nAmong theropods, *Velociraptor mongoliensis* coexisted with competitors such as the oviraptorid *Oviraptor philoceratops* and the troodontid *Saurornithoides mongoliensis*, both of which shared similar body sizes and predatory adaptations in this arid landscape. The alvarezsaurid *Shuvuuia deserti* also occurred in the upper Tugrugyin Member, adding to the variety of small, specialized carnivores. Plant remains, though rare and primarily preserved in mudstones, suggest a conifer-dominated flora with sparse angiosperm elements adapted to the dry conditions, evidenced by root traces and occasional petrified wood fragments near fluvial deposits that indicate localized riparian vegetation.\n\n*Velociraptor* filled a mid-tier predatory and scavenging niche within this ecosystem, targeting smaller vertebrates, eggs, and carrion in a community where larger herbivores like *Protoceratops* juveniles or juveniles of other taxa provided opportunities amid the dunes and oases. The overall biodiversity includes around a dozen recognized dinosaur genera across the formation, with *Velociraptor* representing a common element among small theropods based on fossil occurrences at key sites like Bayn Dzak. This faunal composition reflects a resilient desert biota sustained by episodic water sources and wind-blown nutrients.\n\n## Cultural and Scientific Impact\n\n### Depictions in Media\n\nVelociraptor achieved iconic status in popular culture through its portrayal in the 1993 film *Jurassic Park*, directed by Steven Spielberg, where it was depicted as a 3-meter-long, bipedal predator with scaly skin, enhanced intelligence, and pack-hunting behavior. This representation drew inspiration from the larger North American dromaeosaurid *Deinonychus*, which measured up to 3.4 meters in length, but retained the name *Velociraptor* for dramatic effect. Paleontologist Jack Horner served as a technical consultant on the film and its sequels, advocating for the pack-hunting trait based on his analysis of multiple *Deinonychus* specimens found in close proximity, suggesting group activity. The film's velociraptors, standing nearly as tall as humans and exhibiting coordinated tactics, starkly contrasted with the real animal's turkey-sized stature of about 2 meters in length and 15-20 kilograms in weight.\n\nSubsequent entries in the franchise, including *The Lost World: Jurassic Park* (1997), *Jurassic Park III* (2001), and the *Jurassic World* trilogy (2015-2022), perpetuated this oversized, featherless image, often emphasizing the creatures' cunning and social dynamics, such as training them for combat in *Jurassic World*. These depictions influenced public perception, embedding *Velociraptor* as a symbol of predatory menace in cinema.\n\nIn documentaries, *Velociraptor* appeared in *Walking with Dinosaurs* (1999), portrayed as agile, scaled hunters in desert environments, reflecting the scientific consensus at the time but omitting feathers. Later productions, such as *Prehistoric Planet* (2022) narrated by David Attenborough, presented a more accurate feathered form, showing the dinosaur with insulating plumage and quill-like structures on its arms during nocturnal hunts in Gobi-like settings. Video games have also featured the dinosaur prominently; in *ARK: Survival Evolved* (2015), players tame packs of velociraptors as fast mounts, depicted with partial feathering on the head, back, and tail for enhanced mobility and combat utility.\n\nArtistic representations of *Velociraptor* have evolved significantly since its discovery in 1924. Early 20th-century illustrations showed it as a robust, lizard-like reptile with prominent claws and minimal body covering, emphasizing its role as a solitary scavenger or ambush predator. The 1990s *Jurassic Park* influence reinforced scaly, muscular designs, but post-2007 fossil evidence of quill knobs on related dromaeosaurid forearms prompted a shift toward bird-like depictions with proto-feathers, iridescent plumage, and lighter builds in modern paleoart by artists like Julius Csotonyi.\n\nThese media portrayals have fostered cultural misconceptions, portraying *Velociraptor* as an oversized, hyper-intelligent pack hunter capable of complex strategies, despite limited fossil evidence for group hunting—for related dromaeosaurids such as *Deinonychus*, isotopic studies of teeth indicate age-segregated diets consistent with solitary or opportunistic predation rather than coordinated packs. The emphasis on featherless, monstrous forms has overshadowed the animal's likely warm-blooded, feathered physiology, akin to modern birds.\n\n### Influence on Paleontological Research\n\nThe discovery of the \"Fighting Dinosaurs\" specimen, consisting of a Velociraptor mongoliensis locked in combat with a Protoceratops andrewsi, provided exceptional preservation that revolutionized interpretations of theropod behavior, offering direct fossil evidence of predation dynamics rather than indirect inferences from trace fossils or bite marks. This Djadokhta Formation find from Mongolia, dated to the Late Cretaceous, captured the animals in a death pose suggestive of mutual mortality during an attack, with the Velociraptor's sickle claw embedded in the Protoceratops's neck and the latter's beak gripping the former's arm. The specimen's rapid burial in aeolian sands preserved fine details of struggle, inspiring subsequent taphonomic studies on how catastrophic events like sandstorms could entomb interacting fauna, thereby advancing models of fossilization bias in predator-prey assemblages.\n\nVelociraptor specimens were instrumental in 1990s cladistic analyses that solidified the phylogenetic position of maniraptoran theropods within Paraves, a clade linking non-avian dinosaurs to birds through shared synapomorphies such as enlarged forelimbs and pennaceous feathers. Detailed examinations of cranial and postcranial elements from Gobi specimens, including the holotype AMNH FARB 6515, revealed features like the flexible ankle and ulnar quill knobs that supported Velociraptor's nesting within Dromaeosauridae, closely allied to Avialae. Analyses by Sereno (1997) and Holtz (1998) incorporated these traits into broader theropod matrices, confirming Deinonychosauria (dromaeosaurids plus troodontids) as the sister group to birds and challenging earlier views of theropods as distant from avian ancestry.\n\nPost-2000 methodological advances, including CT scanning of Gobi Velociraptor fossils, enabled non-destructive virtual reconstructions of internal structures, enhancing understandings of sensory capabilities and ecology. For instance, high-resolution CT scans of a partial skull (IGM 100/976) allowed 3D modeling of the endocranium, revealing an expanded olfactory bulb and large floccular lobe indicative of acute smell and agile maneuvers, respectively. More recent 2024 biomechanical models integrated these scans with muscle reconstructions to simulate predatory strikes, estimating that Velociraptor's pennaceous plumage on arms and tail improved turning radius by up to 15% during pursuits, thus refining hypotheses on theropod hunting efficiency.\n\nVelociraptor fossils influenced key debates in paleontology by challenging mid-20th-century perceptions of dinosaurs as slow, scaly reptiles, instead promoting images of agile, feathered predators with active metabolisms. The 2007 identification of quill knobs on a forearm (MPC 100/981) provided direct evidence of large, vaned feathers in Velociraptor, extending feather distribution across Maniraptora and supporting aerodynamic and thermoregulatory functions that aligned with endothermic physiologies. This evidence bolstered hypotheses of theropod endothermy, as inferred from high-activity bone histology and phylogenetic bracketing with birds, shifting consensus toward dinosaurs as warm-blooded ancestors rather than sluggish ectotherms.",
